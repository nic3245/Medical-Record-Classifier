Har is a 43 year old 6' 214 pound gentleman who is referred for
consultation by Dr. Harlan Oneil.  About a week ago he slipped on
the driveway at home and sustained an injury to his left ankle. 
He was seen at Tri-City Hospital and was told he had a
fracture.  He was placed in an air splint and advised to be
partial weight bearing, and he is using a cane.  He is here for
routine follow-up. 
Past medical history is notable for no ankle injuries previously. 
He has a history of diabetes and sleep apnea.  He takes Prozac,
Cardizem, Glucophage and Amaryl.  He is also followed by Dr. Harold
Nutter for an arrhythmia.  He does not smoke.  He drinks
minimally.  He is a set designer at Columbia Pictures.
 
On examination today he has slight tenderness of the left ankle
about four fingerbreadths above the malleolus.  The malleolus is
non-tender medially or laterally with no ligamentous tenderness
either.  Dorsal flexion and plantar flexion is without pain. 
There is no significant swelling.  There are no some skin changes
with some small abrasions proximally.  There is no fibular
tenderness proximally.  No anterior pain is noted.  No hindfoot,
midfoot or forefoot tenderness is noted. 
I would like him to use a tube sock with his air cast.  He is
using a cane for ambulation.  His x-rays do not show a notable
fracture pattern today, and we will await the Radiology opinion. 
I would like him to stay in the air splint with the sock.  I will
see him back in six weeks for review at the Boxborough office. 
 
 
Diagnosis:  Left ankle fracture.

                     CAMPBELL EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT

 

VALDEZ,HARLAN,JR.   845-41-54-4                VISIT DATE: 03/14/08

The patient was seen and examined in the emergency department.  The 

patient was seen by the Emergency Medicine resident.  I have 

discussed the management with the resident.  I have also seen the 

patient primarily and reviewed the medical record.  This is a brief 

addendum to the medical record.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Briefly, this is a 45-year-old 

male who complains of several days of nausea, vomiting, and left 

lower quadrant discomfort.  He also describes intermittent chest 

pain, which he has had for a number of months without significant 

change.  He was sent in from his primary care doctor today with 

this pain and was also noted to have some EKG changes.  The patient 

has no chest pain at the time of evaluation in the emergency 

department and no shortness of breath.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As indicated and otherwise negative.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As indicated in the chart.

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As indicated in the chart.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient is very 

well-appearing, a smiling, very pleasant gentleman in no acute 

distress.  The blood pressure is 119/90, the pulse 82, and the 

temperature 97.9 degrees.  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  The chest 

is clear to auscultation.  The heart has a regular rate and rhythm. 

The abdomen is soft.  He has left lower quadrant tenderness.  He 

also, of note on cardiovascular examination, has a soft murmur 

which he says he has had since childhood.  The extremities are 

normal.  The neurologic examination is non-focal. 

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  This is a gentleman with abdominal 

pain who will receive a CAT scan to rule out diverticulitis.  He 

has also had some non-specific ST changes on his EKG.  He is 

pain-free at this time.  He does not describe a classic exertional 

pattern for his chest pain, but given that he is a diabetic and 

with EKG changes, he will also be admitted for rule out MI.  A CT 

is pending at the time of this dictation.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  As above.  The 

patient's condition is currently stable.

RE: VALDEZ, Harlan 
DHN#: 7672624 
DATE OF BIRTH: 11/09/2062 
CURRENT CLINIC VISIT DATE: 09/14/2109 
 
Dear Vicente, 
 
Thank you in advance for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan B. Valdez, a 46-year-old male patient with prior polysomnographic evidence of sleep disordered breathing, as well as a history of difficulty in sleep, reinitiation and maintenance and increased early morning awakenings, as well as mixed systemic medical conditions.  
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: As you already know, Mr. Valdez who demonstrates a history of difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance, as well as increased early morning awakenings, has noted an exacerbation of these sleep difficulties, occurring in temporal association with his loss of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year. He is now placed in the unfortunate situation of being a single parent to a 15-year-old son and a 10-year-old daughter and describes a modification of his current employment duties of a set designer. In particular, Mr. Valdez describes undergoing on frequent international travelling which has bee markedly curtailed as he is tending to his family situation closer to home.  
 
He described a history of intermittent snoring symptomatology but is unaware of specific nocturnal respiratory pauses. He is unaware of a ""restless"" lower limb sensory complaints which may impact on his ability to initiate or reinitiate sleep. He denies a history of a "" night owl"" personality or circadian rhythm dysfunction which may have played a role with respect to nocturnal sleep disruptions or sleep difficulties.   
He denies a history of paroxysmal abnormal disturbances or associated narcoleptic symptoms.  
 
Mr. Valdez underwent an initial formal polysomnographic evaluation at the center for sleep diagnostics at Holy Cross on 11/26/05, during which time he was noted to demonstrate a respiratory disturbance index of 81/hour, particularly exacerbated in the supine position and characterized predominantly by hypopneas, with equal distribution during non-REM and stage REM sleep and with associated O2 desaturation Nadir of 88% The respiratory disturbances were predominantly obstructive or mixed hypopneas. In addition, loud snoring was noted.  
 
There was evidence of a sleep efficiency of 88% and a short sleep onset latency of 4 minutes. There was a predominance of ""light"" non-REM stages I-II sleep, and a concomitant inability to achieve significant ""slow-wave"" or stage REM sleep. There was also ""alpha intrusions and alpha delta sleep"" evident during the initial sleep study. In addition premature ventricular contractions were noted.  
 
The patient underwent a CPAP titration on 01/15/06, also at the Tenacre Foundation Nursing Home in Boxborough, during which time there was a marked reduction in the frequency of hypopneas (respiratory disturbance index equals 2/hour) with CPAP titrations between 4-6 cm. Sleep efficiency improved to 91%, a short sleep onset latency was also noted (3 minutes). There was once again an increased predominance of ""light"" non-REM stage I-II sleep, with concomitant inability to achieve sustained ""slow wave sleep"".  
 
Since his initial trial of nocturnal CPAP titration (at 6 cm of water pressure) and with various CPAP mask modifications (including CPAP nasal face mask and a Mallinckrodt ""Breeze"" supportive head gear with ""nasal pillows"". The patient describes associated claustrophobic symptomatology, relative difficulties with sustained nocturnal home CPAP use, and difficulties with regards to CPAP to being and complications by the bulkiness of the CPAP machine in general. As a result, he has not utilized nocturnal CPAP therapy for a period of time, although he still maintains the CPAP equipment in his house.  
 
Of particular note, and exacerbation of the past year, the patient demonstrates increased early morning awakenings (averaging 2-4 in number) with typical awakenings occurring approximately two hours after sleep initiation at 9:30 p.m. (the patient describes one awakening at 11:30 p.m. and the second awakening at 11:45 a.m., of unclear causative etiology). The patient then might awaken at 3 a.m. and be ""ready for the day"".  If he is able to reinitiate sleep thereafter, the patient may demonstrate additional two early morning awakenings after a final awakening at 6 a.m.  
 
The patient is noted to have a history of mixed systemic conditions including diabetes, coronary artery disease, depressive disorder, as well as a relatively stable gastrointestinal condition, with no upper GI evidence of gastroparesis.  
 
MEDICATIONS:  
1. Provigil 200 mg p.o. q. a.m. PRN.  
2. Lithium.  
3. Valproate.  
4. Glucophage 850 mg t.i.d.  
5. Humulin 15 units at night.  
6. Folate.  
7. Metoprolol.  
8. Cardia.  
9. Vitamin E.  
10. Coated aspirin.  
 
ALLERGIES/ADVERSE REACTIONS: The patient describes an enhancement to suicidal tendencies in association with prior Prozac usage.   
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies active tobacco or alcoholic beverage usage. He has lost 15-20 pounds over the past several years. His current weight is 195 pounds. He is desirous of losing some additional weight with regards to more regular exercise, but his hectic social situation makes this somewhat difficult at the present time.  
 
On examination, the patient demonstrates a blood pressure of 146/88, (seated, left arm), respiratory rate 16.  
 
HEENT EXAMINATION: Borderline small posterior oropharyngeal aperture, with slightly increased redundant tissue evident posteriorly and a slightly elongated uvula noted.  
 
The patient appears awake, alert, with speech clear and fluent and receptive language function essentially intact. He is presently wearing dental braces. No obvious cranial nerve deficits are appreciated. No focal, sensory, motor or neurologic deficits are noted. No significant appendicular dystaxias or dysmetrias are currently in evidence. The routine gait appears to be normal based, without evidence of significant gait dystaxias.  No current clinical ictal manifestations are present. No acute evidence of ""micro-sleeps"" are noted.  
 
IMPRESSION:  
1. Sleep stage/arrousal dysfunction (780.56): Manifested by subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, increased daytime fatigue and alternating hypersomnia, and recurrent polysomnographic evidence of ""lightened"" sleep pattern, with increased predominance of non-REM stages 1-2 sleep, and with the presence of ""alpha"" intrusions and ""alpha delta"" component to deeper sleep. These latter EEG findings have been described in association with subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, as well as clinical setting of chronic pain related complaints, depressive or anxiety disorder or intercurrent psychotropics agents used (but more usually associated with benzodiazepine or barbituate usage).  
2. Sleep disordered breathing: As evidenced during prior polysomnographic evaluations, mostly of obstructive and or mixed hypopnea. The patient appears largely refractory to a trial of CPAP therapy, particularly in so far as he demonstrates associated claustrophobic symptoms in association with it's usage, despite relatively modest CPAP water pressures (6 cm). In addition, he has tried various nasal CPAP face mask, including the Mallinckrodt ""Breeze"" supportive head gear with ""nasal pillows"" and with limited success. One might consider repeating a polysomnographic evaluation in the future, and if so, utilizing a potential trial of BIPAP titration, which may help to improve claustrophobic symptoms, but the patient will still be left with the issues referable to ""tangled tubing at night"" and issues referable to nasal face mask usage, as noted above.  3. Relative difficulties in sleep reinitiation and maintenance:  The patient describes at least 2-4 early morning awakenings with difficulty in sleep reinitiation and maintenance, thereby compounding his current sleep problem. While there would logically be a relationship between his current sleep exacerbations and the recent death of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year, there may also be evidence of other nocturnal sleep disturbances for which a repeat polysomnographic evaluation; i.e. in particular looking for the presence of increased spontaneous arousals or limb associated arousals or periodic limb movements of sleep may be of a special clinical benefit.  
 
PLAN:  
1. In the short course, in so far as the patient describes himself as being exceedingly tired, and unable to perform the routine daily tasks of work and managing a family in the absence of his deceased wife, I have suggested initiation of PRN Zolpidem tartrate therapy, 5 mg tablets, utilizing one to two tablets p.o.  q. h.s. PRN for difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance.  
2. The patient is advised to take Zolpidem tartrate therapy no more than 2-3 times per week, in an effort to avoid any issues of physiologic dependency.  
3. The patient was advised against potential adverse behavioral and or systemic side effects of Zolpidem tartrate therapy including  hypersomnolence, gastric upset, loose stools, diarrhea, and or cardiac palpitations.  
Pending his clinical response of his Zolpidem tartrate therapy, I then might seek direct treatment for his sleep disordered breathing issues which may include a repeat sleep study with potential trial of BIPAP therapy (in an effort to modify or attenuate claustrophobic symptoms). If he proves poorly responsive to trial of BIPAP therapy however, I might consider supplemental O2 therapy at night and, with this in mind a follow up sleep study should have associated end-tidal CO2 monitoring as well.  
4. In the meantime, the patient was advised to contact the sleep disorders clinic for any acute sleep related concerns in the interim.  
5. The patient may also benefit from nonpharmacologic approaches with regards to sleep reinitiation such as hypnotherapy, but I will hold off on these strategies pending follow up sleep disorders clinic evaluation (in approximately four months time).   
Once again, thank you again for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan Valdez. I hope this letter finds you well.  
 
Sincerely yours,

MRN#: 7672624

Cardiologist:  Dr. Nutter

PCP:  Vicente Barker



CC: Chest Pain    Cath    VF arrest    RCA stenting



History of Present Illness (obtained on admission):  Pt is a 48 yo male with h/o DMII, hypercholesterolemia, Bipolar d/o, and depression who began to have sub-sternal day prior to admission in car and pre-syncope + profound weakness.  This CP was minimal, but the weakness made him pull over.  He had a repeat of these symptoms day of admission.  His EKG c/w 2/2107 showed flattened T-wave in V2 and TWI in V3 and flattened T-waves in I, aVL. His trop was negative, but MB index was elevated.  Due to T-wave flattening, history and elevated index it was decided to start on heparin and ASA and take to cath lab.  



Cath showed right dominant system with prox Cx 40%, LAD clear, RCA prox 70-80% lesion and ostial PDA 90%.  During final dye injection, pt had VF arrest and 2 shocks.  Pt regained puls and was in AF (new) with RVR. Pt was started on amio.  Pt then began to experience discomfort in the RVR and it was decided to intervene.  POBA was done to ostial PDA.  A first no-eluting stent was placed in prox RCA and pt had dissection and thus 2cd stent was placed.  On admission to CCU, pt still in AF with RVR (120's).  He was on amio drip, BB, loaded on plavix, ASA, lipitor, integrilin and was placed on Avandia study.  His complaint of some mild chest pain (not same as anginal pain day before) thought to be from defibrillation.

Russell, Donna

Ms. Russell comes in for further evaluation.  She has been in Rhode Island for 
six months.  Her complaint is that she has heaviness in the chest.  She 
does not have any palpitations.  She does not note that this is 
associated with exertion.  She does have diaphoresis associated with it.  
She does not have any shortness of breath.  This heaviness has been in 
her chest on and off for the last six weeks.  She is quite concerned.

She has a history of hypothyroidism and hypertension.  She also has 
hyperlipidemia and is being treated with Lipitor.  Her health 
maintenance has been in order.  She has just had a hysterectomy.  She 
needs to have a follow-up mammogram done.  However, today I am most 
concerned about her chest heaviness.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure is 130/80, respiratory rate is 
20 and pulse is 68.  Neck is supple.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  
Chest is clear to both percussion and auscultation.  Cardiac exam is 
regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdomen is soft and 
nontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are clear of 
cyanosis, clubbing and edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Her sodium is 145, electrolytes are all otherwise 
within normal limits.  TSH is 2.0.  LFTs are pending at this time.  We 
sent her for an electrocardiogram, which showed normal sinus rhythm with 
nonspecific ST-T wave changes.  We also sent her for an exercise 
tolerance test with preliminary reports showing that she went to a 
maximum heart rate of 108, she was on the protocol for 6 minutes 50 
seconds.  She had no evidence of ischemia.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.	Chest heaviness.  I am not sure what is causing this.  She may have a 
primary pulmonary problem.  She will be following up with us in one 
week.  It is heartening to see that she does not have an abnormal 
exercise tolerance test.
2.	Hypothyroidism, well controlled at the present time.  Continue same 
dose of Synthroid.
3.	Hypertension, well controlled presently.
4.	Hyperlipidemia.  We will recheck this on her next visit.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Russell is returning for follow 
up.  She has had couple of further episodes of this peculiar 
sensation in which her arm feels like it goes dead and then she 
gets some pressure in her chest.  She gets a slight shortness of 
breath.  It lasts 30 seconds.  She gets as many as three or four 
a day.  The frequency has, however, decreased and she is feeling 
better and better, as she begins to lose some weight.  I think 
weight loss is going to be critical.  She also is less fatigued 
as she begins to lose weight.

Her hypertension has been under better control.  
Hydrochlorothiazide seems to be helping quite a bit in addition 
to the atenolol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 146/86.  Weight has gone 
from 200 to 196 pounds.  Respiratory rate is 20.  Pulse is 64.  
Neck is supple.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  Chest is clear to 
percussion and auscultation.  Cardiac exam is regularly regular 
with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdomen is soft and nontender.  
There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are clear of 
cyanosis, clubbing and edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Electrolytes are within normal limits.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
1.	Hypertension.  Relatively well controlled on 
hydrochlorothiazide plus atenolol.
2.	Weight.  Now began to lose some weight and feeling much 
better as a result of it.
3.	Peculiar chest pressure.  I do not think she has coronary 
artery disease given the exercise test.  In light of this, 
we will try to control her blood pressure and get her to 
lose some weight.  Hopefully, this will help with the 
resolution of her symptoms.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Russell returns for further evaluation.  
She has been doing very well.  She has been exercising and has lost from 
200 to 170 pounds.  She is feeling very well.

Notably, Dr. Lu sent her for a follow-up ETT.  He did not find the 
first ETT acceptable.  The second ETT was grossly positive.  As a result 
of this, I think it is reasonable for us in addition to having her on 
atenolol to stop the hydrochlorothiazide, put her on ramipril and a 
nitrate.  She is having once every two weeks feeling a slight twinge of 
pain that she was having before when she went up steps.

She did have hyperlipidemia.  We have put her on Lipitor, which has 
provided some control.  However, her HCL is still 36 and LDL 118, which 
is not an excellent ratio.  Nonetheless, her CK has been within normal 
limits.

She also has right shoulder lipoma.  This has become apparent since she 
lost so much weight.  She wanted to see someone in follow up and I have 
recommended Dr. Dawson.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her weight is 170 pounds, blood pressure is 
120/64, respiratory rate is 20, and pulse is 64.  Neck is supple.  There 
is no lymphadenopathy.  Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation.  
Cardiac exam is regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  
Abdomen is soft and nontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  
Extremities are clear of cyanosis, clubbing, and edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  None today.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.	CAD.  We will start her on ramipril and long acting nitrate.  I also 
gave her nitroglycerine.  We will stop her hydrochlorothiazide but 
continue her atenolol.  She is also on one aspirin a day along with 
Premarin and Synthroid.
2.	Weight loss.  She will continue to exercise.  I suspect she is going 
to lose more weight.  This is excellent.
3.	Coronary artery disease.  Dr. Lu will be deciding when to do a 
cardiac catheterization.  It is his opinion, and I must concur that 
this is an appropriate next step with Ms. Russell.  She is going to 
delay her usual trip to Rhode Island until we can get final assessment 
done on this variety of medical issues.

Interim History:	

Comes to review diabetes and related problems.

He feels that he gets tired and needs to rest more after doing any exercise. He denies shortness of breath or chest pain, but he is not just describing generalized fatigue in that this is clearly related to physical exercise. He has not had an ETT since April, 2122.

Home Blood Tests:  

B 	103-149

L	not testing

S	not testing

HS	150-175, about 2pc

Neuropathy:	No foot discomfort.

Cardiac:	above; has seen Dr. Brian recently.

Vascular:	No claudication



Past Medical History: 

Has had flu shot this year.

He told me in 2119 that he had had a PneumoVax, but did not know exactly when.



Social History: 

His wife has had walking difficulty after radiation therapy for her gynecologic malignancy. She sees Dr. YAEL Pratt.



Social History:

He retired. A new management gave him 3 hours to decide whether to retire or to work nights.

Impressions and Plan:	

Would check some BS before supper as well.

I have several concerns:

Could his exercise-induced fatigue be an angina-equivalent? Will defer to Dr. Brian with respect to the need for another ETT.

His weight loss continues, without explanation. Dr. Chandler is aware of this.

His L great toe is of concern. Dr. Aldridge has been following this area and he will continue to follow-up with him.

RE:  Bruce Corona

FHC Unit #:  795-76-17



Dear Dunham:



I had the pleasure of seeing  Bruce Corona in the Cardiology Department office for a f/u visit.  Since I last saw him, he continues to complain of dyspnea.  An ETT was negative for ischemia.  PFTs were not really useful.  CT of the chest showed scarring/fibrosis.  His NT-proBNP has been on the marginal side, though he is without evidence for overt CHF.



Medications:  Aspirin 325 mg qd, Flomax 0.4 mg qd, Lopressor 25 mg bid, Lipitor 10 mg qd, Lisinopril 20 mg qd, Colace 100 mg tid.



Physical examination:  Reveals him to be well appearing. His BP is 120/70 and his heart rate is 60 and regular. He is 170 pounds.  There is no jugular venous distention and carotid pulses are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.  His lungs are clear throughout, and notably demonstrate only very slight dullness at the left base.  His sternotomy is healing well and is stable.  His apical impulse is non-displaced with a slightly irregular rate and rhythm, a normal S1 and S2.  He has an S3 gallop.  No murmur.  His abdomen is benign without hepatosplenomegaly, bruits, or a dilated aorta.  There is no pedal edema and posterior tibial pulses are 2+ bilaterally.



EKG:  NSR with a 1st degree AV block.  He has a LBBB, which is chronic.



Impression:



1.CAD, s/p MI: currently stable.



2. Hypertension: under good control.



3.Hypercholesterolemia: controlled



4. Dyspnea: I suspect he has an element of diastolic dysfunction.  I will restart low-dose lasix.



Thank you very much for the opportunity to participate in his care.



With best regards,



Bruce D. Brian, Jr., M.D.

   His customary dyspnea persists, but otherwise, nothing is new.  No chest discomfort.  No PND or orthopnea.



Medications:  Aspirin 325 mg qd, Lipitor 10 mg qd, Diovan 160 mg qd



Physical examination:  Reveals him to be well appearing. His BP is 111/50 and his heart rate is 68 and regular. He is 176 pounds.  There is no jugular venous distention and carotid pulses are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.  His lungs are clear throughout, and notably demonstrate only very slight dullness at the left base.

EKG:  NSR with a 1st degree AV block.  He has a narrow QRS with an old ASMI. Compared, the LBBB is no longer evident.



Impression:



1.CAD, s/p MI: currently stable.  Symptoms of dyspnea may be an ischemic equivalent, though, so I will give him a nitropatch.



2. Hypertension: under good control.



3.Hypercholesterolemia: controlled



4. Dyspnea: I suspect he has an element of diastolic dysfunction together with age-related deconditioning and chronic lung disease.  Nitrates might help the former issue.

Imaging:

CXR - poor inspiration, low lung volumes w/ soft tissue, mild cardiomegaly, early failure.



EKG:



5/15/97 02:37

Sinus brady w/ rate 50; inferior STE, 1-2 mm; biphasic apical TWI; lateral TWI, likely reciprocal changes; slight LAE.



Assessment/Plan:



45 yo F with multiple medical problems, particularly obesity, tobacco history, DM presenting with significant EKG changes in inferior distribution. Because the cath lab was occupied, ward cardiology opted to forego delay and treated her with Reteplase x 2 with excellent results, including resolution of symptoms and resolution of EKG changes.



1.	Ischemia.

Now on plavix, statin. 

Has received ASA several times during this evaluation. Allergy is GI upset. Clarify with aim of continuing daily ASA for vascular prophylaxis.

Continue heparin peri-event period.

Needs ACE I for remodeling as well as risk reduction as pt has DM.

She merits further definition of her coronary anatomy by catheterization in 1-2 days. Lysis has risk of restenosis, plus may have additional lesion of borderline significance.

High risk for post-lytic restenosis; follow daily EKG, symptoms, markers.

If pt unwilling to undergo cath, then echo plus stress test for characterization of risk stratification.



2.	Pump.

Slightly volume overloaded, can administer lasix 20 IV now.

Echo to evaluate post-event remodeling, define anatomy and physiology.

Advance lopressor as tolerated.



3.	DM.

Checking sugars QID. Holding hypoglycemics.

She will require tight control peri-infarct.

	Cont medications for glaucoma.



4.	Psychiatric.

Pt's out-pt regimen will be maintained during this hospitalization. No indication for psychiatric consult.



5.	Hypothyroidism.

Maintain on current dosage of levoxyl w/out checking TFTs during hospitalization.



6.	Chronic pain.

Cont neurontin.

Provide low-dose narcotic as previously scheduled on out-pt med list.

7.	Prophylaxes.

Nexium; on heparin post-event.

Dr. Mabel Duvall 

Medicine Department 

Bellflower Doctors Hospital 

 

 

RE:  TUTTLE, Sandy 

MR#:  2793372 

DOB:  January 16, 2082 

 

 

Dear Dr. Duvall:  

 

Thank you for referring Mr. Sandy Tuttle to our Neurology Department.  I understand that he is referred here for evaluation of polyneuropathy.  

 

Mr. Tuttle is a 63-year-old right-handed diabetic man who has developed numbness of his lower extremities since 2125.  The numbness started in his toes and gradually spread proximally up to the level of the knees.  In 2135, the numbness started to affect his hands.  In 2139, the patient noted atrophy of the first dorsal interosseous muscles of both hands, left worse than right.  

 

The patient denies any pain in his legs or feet.  He has a five year history of localized low back pain and neck pain radiating to his left upper extremity all the way down to his hands.  In 2125, the patient fell down a ladder from a height of about 30 feet.  According to the patient, he herniated a cervical disk, but surgery was not indicated.  He remembers having pain in his left elbow and neck after the fall.  

 

The patient developed impotence and constipation in 2130.  In 2139, he started to have symptoms of orthostatic hypotension which he described as feeling light-headed, darkening of vision upon standing.  The patient also noted gait imbalance in 2139 prior to his retirement in 2141.  

 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin dependent diabetes since 2123, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, constipation, impotence, macular degeneration of the eyes, retinopathy, s/p laser treatments, history of neck pain and low back pain as mentioned above, history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, skin problems using a number of steroid creams, penile implant in 2130.  

 

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Atenolol, Diltiazem, Zestril, Mevacor, steroid creams, Colace, metoclopramide, Naprosyn, insulin.   



ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  

 

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married he has two daughters, 30 and 40 years of age.  He used to work as a Legal Secretary until he retired in December of 2141.  The patient quit smoking in 2107.  He denies any history of alcohol or drug abuse.  

 

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died of unclear cause at the age of 45.  His father was diabetic and had heart problems.  Mother died in her 30's.  The patient does not know the cause of death.  The patient had one brother who died in his 50's from diabetic complications.  He had two sister who died of diabetic complications.  Of his two living sisters, one of them is also a diabetic.  The patient's daughters are not diabetic.  There is no known family history of neuromuscular disorders.  

 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Range of motion of the neck is limited.  Head turning 45 degrees to either side.  Limited neck extension.  Negative straight-leg raising.  Negative spine tenderness.  Regular cardiac rhythm, no heart murmur.  Negative carotid bruits.  In the supine position, blood pressure 105/50, heart rate 60 and regular.  Upon standing, blood pressure dropped to 60/40, heart rate remained 60.  The patient was asymptomatic.   



NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:  Mental status:  Alert, coherent and appropriate.  The patient knows the name of his physician, Dr. Duvall, Dr. Villagomez, and Dr. Goldberg at Pioneer Home.  

 

Cranial nerves:  Visual fields full.  Visual acuity with reading glasses 20/30 on the right, 20/20 -1 on the left.  Extraocular movements full.  No nystagmus.  Pupils sluggishly reactive to light.  Optic discs flat bilaterally.  No facial asymmetry.  The tongue and soft palate move symmetrically.  

 

Motor examination:  Atrophy of the first dorsal interosseous and ADM, worse on the left hand.  No atrophy of the abductor pollicis brevis.  Negative arm drift.  Motor strength testing 5/5 in all muscles of both upper extremities except for 4/5 weakness of the first dorsal interosseous and abductor digiti minimi bilaterally.  No weakness of the abductor pollicis brevis on either hand.  Motor strength testing of the lower extremities 5/5 except for mild weakness of toe extensors 4+/5 bilaterally.  The patient was able to walk on his toes and heels while holding onto the examiner.  Deep tendon reflexes 2+ bilaterally at the biceps, triceps, and knees.  Absent ankle jerks bilaterally.  Toes downgoing.  No spasticity of the lower extremities.

   

Sensory examination:  Significant for absent pin prick sensation in both feet up to the level of the knees.  Pin prick sensation is diminished in the dorsal aspect of all fingers and the palmar aspect of both hands.  Vibratory sensation absent in the toes, intact at the ankles and knees bilaterally.  Intact vibratory sensation in the upper extremities.  Romberg test significant for body swaying, but the patient did not fall.  Tandem gait was poor, but improved when holding the examiner.  No limb ataxia.   



LABORATORY DATA:  Review of previous laboratory tests of May, 2145, BUN 36, creatinine 1.7, glucose 310.  December, 2144, TSH normal.  October, 2143, B12 normal.  Negative RPR.  The patient said he was tested negative for HIV in 2142, and 2143.  MRI of the brain in 2142 and 2143 revealed bilateral white matter changes in the cerebral hemisphere without any intracranial mass lesion.   



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  In summary, we have a 63-year-old diabetic man who appears to have significant sensorimotor polyneuropathy with autonomic involvement.  He does have constipation and impotence as well as orthostatic hypotension.  



As we discussed on the phone, his antihypertensive medications need to be adjusted and the patient will be following up with you regarding this.  He may benefit from Jobst stockings to reduce his symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.  I will be ordering an EMG to assess his polyneuropathy and look for any evidence of superimposed ulnar neuropathy or cervical radiculopathy on the left.  The EMG should also include RR interval variations and sympathetic skin responses.  

 

MRI of the cervical spine was also ordered to rule out any cord compression which may also contribute to loss of sensation in the legs.  The patient does have a history of traumatic cervical herniated disk in 2125.  He may also have had a left elbow injury at this time which can make him prone to develop tardy ulnar palsy.  

 

The patient will return for a follow-up visit after the above tests.  

 

Thank you again for referring Mr. Sandy Tuttle to our Neurology Department.  

 

Sincerely, 

 

 

 

Stanly Lang, M.D.

Reason for consult:  65 year old man with progressive LBP, found to have heterogeneous marrow on MRI, we have been consulted to help evaluate, possibly perform a bone marrow biopsy.



HPI:

65 yo male with PMH significant for DM, autonomic dysfunction, CRI, depression and arthritis who was admitted for progressive lower back pain.  He has had LBP for at least three years which is located in his mid lumbar region, non radiating, worse with standing.  The pain had progressed such that he has a very poor performance status. He cannot stand but for a few minutes at a time.  He denies focal wekness.   He had an MRI of the LS spine 2/02/47 which revealed heterogeneous marrow concernig for an infiltrating process in his marrow.   He has had an SPEP which was normal, he has had a bone scan which was negatvie. He does not have an elevated protein or globulin fraction. His CRI is longstanding  and attributed to his DM.  He was set up for a outpt BM bx to evaluate the marrow process, but the pain has been so severe, he was admitted for an inpatient work up.  Of note he has longstanding anemia related to his CRI, perhaps anemia of chronic disease.  He denies any weight loss, fevers, chills, night sweats, decreased appetite. He does report fatigue which has become progressive.

MRI 1/47: heterogenous bonemarrow uptake in vertebrae and pelvis, concerning for infiltrative process



Imp/Plan:

Mr. Tuttle is a 65 year old male with a three year hisotry of porgressive lower back pain, non-radicualr in nature. The pain has progressed to a significant level such that he spends most of his day in bed.  He did have an MRI of the L/S spine which was negative except it did reveal heterogeous uptake in the vertebral and pelvic bone marrow. They raised the question of multiple myeloma or another infiltrative process. He does have renal insufficiency, but no other abnormalities to suggest MM. We still need a few key pieces of data to rule this out. Other infiltrative processes such as malignancy from elsewhere should be excluded.  In addition, he has a hx of a positive PPD, unclear if he actually had active TB or was treated prophylactically. Is any of this TB?  Recommend:

-- skeletal survey

-- quantitative urine bence jones proteins as there are  non-secretory myelomas

-- beta-2 microglobulin

-- reticulocyte count

-- consider chest CT to r/o lung cancer given his history of tobacco

-- guaiac all stools

-- Will review the MRI with radiologist to get a better differential

-- Consider BM biopsy next week, unfortunately will not be able to perform today. 

-- Will review smear and staff with Dr. Landry in the afternoon.

Thank you for this consult.

REASON FOR VISIT:  Followup for diabetic cheiropathy.  Rule out other diabetes-related musculoskeletal syndrome.  Monitoring of Ultracet therapy and left shoulder injection.  

 

INTERVAL HISTORY:  Left shoulder injection was helpful but only last short time.  Just  a week or so.  Ultracet was relieving pains but was not able to afford it.  Feels stable and not worse since last seen.  Telling me he is cutting down his medications and he is letting his doctors know about this. No acute swelling or further different joint complaints other than what was described in my previous notes.  Rest of review of systems again unchanged.   



MEDICATIONS:  The medication file is same as last time, except for addition of Tylenols now.  

 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: BP 100/70.  Other VS WNL. Wt. 170lb.  Gait:  Slow.  Cooperative.  VSS.  HEENT:  Halitosis.  Poor teeth hygiene.  Lungs:  Clear.  Heart:  Unremarkable.  Abdomen exam:  Slight sensitiveness in epigastrium.  A little low-frequency tremor in extremities.  Musculoskeletal examination:  Both shoulders with limited ROM.  Left shoulder active ROM is improved compared to the last description.  Hands with prayer's sign present.  Elbows again show lesser degree of flexion contracture.  Range of motion in both shoulders diminished, 

more in the left side.  Hardening of skin on the palm side of hands.  Has atrophy of intrinsic muscles of hands.  The rest of joint examination, free of inflammation.  Unchanged from last description.  

 

IMPRESSION:  Diabetic cheiropathy.  Rule out other diabetes-related musculoskeletal syndrome esp in shoulders.  Helped by Ultracet.  Osteoarthritis changes of early stage.  Status post olecranon bursitis.  Elevated creatinine.  

 

PLANS:  

1.  Continue Ultracet up 2 tablets prn once     twice a day; Samples given.

2.  May consider low-dose narcotics, given his multiple comorbidity and sensitive renal function to nonsteroidal therapy.  3.  Close followup for diabetes care with other physicians.   

DISPOSITION:  Followup in 4 months or so.

Orthostatic hypotension

Fairly severe orthostasis, likely secondary to autonomic dysfunction from diabetes.  Continues to c/o dizziness + nausea with prolonged standing. On fludrocortisone 1x/d, midodrine 10 TID, occ wearing TED stockings. 

A/P: Encourage H2O intake. Needs TED stockings. Continue fludrocortisone 0.1 mg/d, may need to decrease midodrine.

Renal insufficiency

Patient has a h/o DM and CRI. Baseline Cr ranges from 2-3, but went as low as 1.4 in the hospital with hydration. Est CrCl around 28. Ulytes c/w renal disease. Nephrologist Dr. Nesmith. He tries he drinks 6 8 oz glasses of water qd but sometimes doesn't drink as much as that. 

A/P: Encourage hydration, IVF + mucomyst o/n pre cath.



Active Medications

Assessment and plan   1. CAD: NSTEMI, on ASA, heparin, statin. 2b3a to start, cath pending in AM. Would recheck fasting cholesterol and change to lipitor 80 qd for maximal risk factor management. Be VERY CAUTIOUS in use of BB, ACE with orthostatic hypotension (he has supine HTN but is extremely orthostatic when he stands up).

- cards consult appreciated

- bedrest x 24h

- increase BB; hold ACE with pending cath.

- pls repeat TTE as per cards

- fasting chol pending; inc lipitor to 80 qd.



2. BP: orthostatic hypotension/supine hypertension

- d/c midodrine, florinef

- BP control with BB (he will NOT be able to go home on this), IV TNG + nitropaste as needed.



3. CRI: DM + chronic prerenal. Continue hydration with IVF o/n.

- mucomyst, hold ACE.



4. DM: on  Insulin 75/25, 28 qA, 26qP. Continue QID FS, adjust as needed. Pls resend HbA1c and get a nutrition consult. I am concerned that he is on too much regular insulin causing his nightsweats and his low glc at FCH yesterday. He may need to change back to NPH and regular (was difficult in the past 2/2 poor vision and arthritis).



5. constipation: pls increase bowel regimen (currently on miralax + colace).



6. PT consult please. He will likely need rehab.



Thanks for the excellent care! I will continue to follow with you.

PROGRESS NOTE					DOB:		







Quiana is a 72-year-old woman who comes in for follow-up of her hypertension.  Please see her current medication list.  She also has a history of diabetes.  



Over the past few weeks to one month she has been having intermittent right shoulder pain.  It is worse with lifting.  The pain is in her deltoid muscle and radiates a little bit across her upper back.  It is worse if she actually lies on her shoulder at night.  There is no history of trauma, no neck pain, no upper extremity numbness or weakness except for occasional left thumb numbness.  The thumb numbness resolves if she shakes her hand.



She is also having bilateral knee pain when she walks.  There is no swelling or effusion or heat in her knees.  She had been on Vioxx for her spinal stenosis but stopped it because it was not helping her spinal stenosis pain.  Instead for her shoulder pain she has been taking Advil 200 mg 2 and up to 6 per day. She takes the Advil with food or milk and is not having any GI upset from it.  



She is having a lot of stresses with her husband, whom she feels may have some early memory problems.  His mini-mental status on his last exam was a 30/40.  However, he makes, according to her, arbitrary decisions, does not complete projects he starts, and not as task-oriented as he used to be.  He does not complete tasks or shopping errands that she would like him to do.  We discussed that he should make a follow-up appointment to see me to repeat his mini-mental status exam, but that some of these problems are not likely to be easily resolvable, and that she might benefit from finding ways to manage her anxiety and stress level.  She does get very anxious and upset at times.  She had been considering taking Ativan p.r.n. when she gets very upset and frustrated.  She is also having stressors with her grandson, who lives next door and has a problem with substance abuse and questionable money issues.  



She denies chest pain, PND, orthopnea, or edema.  She is on her diabetes medication.  She likes going to work because that gets her out of the house.



ON EXAMINATION:  She is a pleasant, animated woman in no acute distress.  Her blood pressure initially was 160/80.  After discussing her situation with her husband, her blood pressure was 180/85.  Neck supple without JVD or bruits.  Lungs are clear without rales or rhonchi.  Cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm and normal S1, S2 without S3, S4, or murmurs.  She has no peripheral edema.

 

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



(1)	Hypertension, poor control.  Will increase her Zestril to 40 mg p.o. q.d.  Her daughter, Iyanna Field who is a registered nurse, will continue to monitor her blood pressure.  

(2)	Right shoulder pain.  On exam she has good range of motion of her shoulder and her muscle strength and reflexes are intact.  She can continue the Advil p.r.n. but should take it with antacids or something to protect her stomach.  



(3)	Adult-onset diabetes.  We will check her Hemoglobin A1c.  



She will follow up for her complete physical in May.

NAME:    Justus, Quiana
MRN:       9814048

Quiana is a 73-year-old woman with hypertension, diabetes and spinal stenosis who
comes in for a physical.  She has spinal stenosis as documented by her prior MRI's. 
She can usually walk about 5 minutes and then develops pain in her thighs and
calves.  She has some knee pain with walking, but it is not consistent and does not
occur after short 5-minute distances.  The thigh and calf pain resolve with rest.  She
does not always have back pain with the thigh and calf pain.  She also has occasional
right lateral foot pain that feels like an achy arthritic pain in her foot.  She takes
Vioxx occasionally for that foot pain.  She does not have any dysesthesias or
numbness in her feet or hands.  She has no recent trauma, fevers or chills.  She has
no change in her bowel or bladder.

She has type 2 diabetes.  She has been taking Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.  Her weight is
stable.  She does get annual ophthalmology evaluations.  

She has a history of hypertension. She has not had any chest pain, PND, orthopnea,
dyspnea on exertion or edema.  Her blood pressure is never well controlled when she
comes for her visits here, but her daughter, Iyanna Field, a nurse takes her
blood pressure at home and she reports that it is typically 120/70.  She is currently on
Propranolol LA 160 2 tabs p.o. q.d., Dyazide 1 tab p.o. q.d., Captopril 50 mg t.i.d.

She has a history of hyperlipidemia.  She was intolerant of Lipitor in the past.  She
has been taking the Lopid 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. without complications.  She does not do
regular breast self-exams but has not noted any masses.  She is status-post
menopause.  We discussed DEXA bone density scanning, but she did not want to do
it at this time.

We also discussed colon cancer screening.  For now she elects to do stool guaiacs x 3. 
She has not had any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena or hematochezia, abdominal
pain or weight loss.    

Please see her complete medication update in the LMR. 

SOCIAL HISTORY: She is married.  She drinks occasional but not excessive alcohol. 
She does not smoke.  There is no history of domestic abuse.

FAMILY HISTORY: Please see family history update in the LMR.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative.

She has not had a recent tetanus shot.

PHYSICAL EXAM: She is a very pleasant woman in no acute distress. Her blood
pressure here is 150/90.  Her neck is supple without JVD or bruits.  Lungs are clear
without wheezes, rales or rhonchi.  Her breasts are without masses or adenopathy. 
Her cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2 without S3, S4 or
murmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender without hepatosplenomegaly.  She is
moderately obese.  Her rectal exam is without masses.  She has no spinal tenderness
on palpation.  Her lower extremity strength is 5/5.  She does not have any peripheral
edema.  Her distal pulses are 2+.  Her sensation is intact to light touch in her feet.  

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  

(1)  Back pain with calf and thigh pain with walking.  This is probably due to her
     spinal stenosis.  However, she is at risk for claudication given her diabetes,
     hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  We will check lower extremity noninvasive
     arterial studies to rule out claudication.  She can take the Vioxx p.r.n. for her
     foot pain which I do not think is related.

(2)  Type 2 diabetes.  She needs a hemoglobin A1c.  Her blood pressure ideally
     should be under 130/85.  She reports that it is consistently below that level
     when her daughter checks it.  She needs as chem-7.  She has no evidence for
     neuropathy at this time.

(3)  Health maintenance.  She needs a tetanus shot which she was given today. 
     Will check stool guaiacs x 3.  

We discussed calcium supplementation for osteoporosis prevention.  She will follow
up in six months and p.r.n.  She has not had a recent tetanus shot. She was given a
tetanus shot in the left deltoid without complications.

NAME:    Justus, Quiana

MRN:     9814048



The patient comes in today for follow up of several medical problems. She has a

history of type 2 diabetes. Her sugars have not been optimally controlled. They are

usually in the 190-200 range in the morning. Her weight is stable. She has no lower

extremity numbness or weakness.  



She has a history of hyperlipidemia. She stopped her Lescol 2 weeks ago because it

was expensive. She also never increased the dose above 20 mg. She has had side

effects with atorvastatin and pravastatin in the past. Please see her allergy list in

LMR.



She has a half sister who had colon cancer at age 88. Quiana has had rare

occasional blood streaking when she wipes herself after being constipated. She is

aware of what a colonoscopy is but absolutely refuses a colonoscopy. She is aware

that she is at increased risk for colon cancer given her family history. She has no

nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena or weight loss.



She has chronic lower back pain and bilateral leg pain that is probably due to spinal

stenosis. She has lower back pain and pain in her legs that is worse with walking. It

helps when she uses a carriage to walk around in the store. She denies lower

extremity numbness, change in her bowel or bladder, fevers or chills. Her last MRI

was done in Walsenburg in a wide body machine and was consistent with spinal stenosis. 

She has taken Ultram. She is aware that Vioxx may increase people's risk for cardiac

disease and has stopped taking it. Dr. Yeager, her rheumatologist, referred her to Dr.

North in Internal Medicine for possible injections. 



PHYSICAL EXAM: No acute distress. Her blood pressure is 180/90. However, her

daughter,Iyanna Field, checks her blood pressure at home and it is very well controlled. 

The patient gets very anxious here in the clinic. Neck supple without JVD or bruits.

Lungs clear without wheezes, rales or rhonchi. Cardiac: Rate regularly regular,

normal S1, S2 without S3, S4 or murmurs. No C/C/E. Distal pulses intact.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



(1)  Type 2 diabetes. Check hemoglobin A1c. Continue current medications.



(2)  Hyperlipidemia. She should be on medication to keep her LDL below 100. She

     said that she would resume the medication.



(3)  Hypertension which is never well controlled on her visits here. Her daughter is

     a nursing professional and does report that her blood pressure is very well controlled

     in the 120/80 range when she checks at home. We will continue her current

     regimen.



(4)  Lower back pain. Probably secondary to spinal stenosis. She has an

     appointment with Dr. North.

CCU Admission Note
Patient Name: Justus, Quiana
MR# 9814048
Location: Internal Medicine
PCP: Xayachack, Ida, M.D.
Date of Admission: 3/18/91
CC: STEMI


HPI: 
79 yo lady with DM, HTN, HL who presented with new onset chest pain and shortness of breath and was found to have lateral STEMI. It began last Sunday, when she noticed the new onset of back pain, which progressed and was associated with shortness of breath by Monday. She apparently called EMS on Tuesday then and en route she had a long run of VT, which responded to 50mg of Lidocaine IV. She was intubated on arrival in the ED for progressive respiratory distress. ECG showed lateral ST elevations and a CT scan of her chest was negative for any signs of aortic dissection. Of note, she was also noticed to have elevated blood sugars in the 500s in the ED with an AG of 20, that came down to 16. 


On immediate LHC, a 100% occlusion of her OM1 was found and recannalized as well as stented with a Vision BMS, resulting in TIMI 2 flow. Her LAD was found to be patent but and her RCA showed diffuse atherosclerosis up to 60% stenosis at most. LV ventriculogram showed inferior hypokinesis with moderate MR.  An IABP was placed with her initial augmented diastolic pressures recorded in the 80s, which led to the initiation of Levophed, Dobutamine and Dopamine.


A PAC was placed in the cath lab as well with her initial Wedge reported as 19-20,  PAPs in the 50s.


On transfer to the CCU, she was intubated, sedated, being on IV Levophed at 20/hr, Dobutamine at 200/hr and Dopamine at 300/hr. Her CO was recorded as 6.0, her CI 3.5 with an initial SVR of 1012. Her Temp. was 96.1, HR 115 bpm, augmented diastolic BP of 124, which subsequently ranged between 70 and 100 on the day of her admission. She spiked a temperature up to 101 on the evening of admission after she received a dose of Levaquin IV in the setting of a rising WBC up to 40K. Vasopressin was added IV, which provided further support of her MAP. Intermittent NS fluid boluses helped to bring her HR down per RN and supported her MAPs with her PAD ranging between 18-24 and a urine output between 30 and 100 cc/hr. When her CI dropped to 1.9 around 9.30 pm with an increased SVR of 1550, the cardiac fellow was called and the decision was made to wean her Levophed as tolerated, which was then brought down to 16/hr with her Dopamine having been weaned off and continued Dobutamine and Vasopressin. The patient was also maintained on Reopro and Heparin IV for her STEMI.

Initial ABG was 7.12/39/61, which gradually improved up to 7.37/32/110 in the evening of her admission.


CXR:
Bilateral somewhat symmetric perihilar airspace opacities both lungs.  This could be edema or pneumonia. No large pleural effusions or pneumothoraces. Interval placement of the due left lower lobe monitor line below. Endotracheal tube and 4.6 cm.  NG tube to stomach.


CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis &#8211; AD protocol:
No evidence of aortic dissection, narrowed SMA at its origin. Bilateral consolidation in the dependent portions of the upper and lower lobes, consistent with aspiration and/or pneumonia. Interlobular septal thickening and small bilateral pleural effusions, consistent with pulmonary edema. Indeterminate hypodense lesion in the body of the pancreas. Differential considerations include a cyst and IPMN. Bilateral renal hypodensities, the largest of which are consistent with simple cysts. Heterogeneous thyroid gland, with areas of hypodensity.
 
Bedside TTE: no evidence of papillary muscle rupture, moderate MR present


EKG in ED at 6.32AM: NSR, STE in I, II, aVF, V5, V6
EKG in ED at 7.31AM: RAD, VT, STE in I, aVL, V5,V6
EKG on CCU Admission: NSR at 113 , RBBB, left posterior fascicular block, 3-4 mm STE in V4-V6, 2-3 mm in II,III, AvF
Repeat EKG 9 hours after CCU Admission: NSR at 99 , RBBB, left posterior fascicular block, 3-4 mm STE in V4-V6, II,III, AvF resolving.


Impression:
79 yo lady with DM, HTN, HL who presented with lateral STEMI with occluded OM1, s/p BM stent and is now in cardiogenic and septic shock.


Plan: 
1.        CV Pump: cardiogenic shock: continue vasopressor and inotrope support with Dobutamine, Levophed, Vasopressin, goal to wean Levophed to reduce afterload and increase CI, continue to give fluid boluses intermittently as she appeared preload dependent possibly due to RV involvement, MAP goal above 65, goal to keep CI above 2.2, f/u urine output with goal to keep above 25, trending lactic acid
2.        CV Ischemia: STEMI, cont. ASA, Plavix, Heparin, Reopro, holding BB and ACE in setting of hypotension, will check HbA1c
3.        CV Rhythm: currently NSR, on Tele
4.        Septic shock: aspiration event vs. possibly CAP, no evidence of other infectious source, covering empirically with Vancomycin/Levaquin IV given absence of recent hospitalization over the past 90 days, checking C.diff, will have low threshold to broaden coverage further if necessary
5.        HTN: currently hypotensive, holding BP meds
6.        DM: holding Metformin, RISS
7.        FEN: NPO for now with NGT on continous suctioning
8.        Prophylaxis: Heparin IV, PPI IV bid
9.        Code Status: Full Code 
10.   Dispo: pending resolution of acute medical issues

The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease who comes in today for followup. Please see the recent note from cardiology from 06/27/2091. She is status post stenting in 03/2091 and 06/2091. Post her second procedure she also had a large hematoma which has been gradually resolving. 


She has type 2 diabetes and her fasting sugars have been very well controlled. She is currently on metformin 1000 mg b.i.d. and glyburide 5 mg b.i.d. She is trying to watch her diet and salt intake. She has not had any symptoms of hypoglycemia. She had lost some weight after her first heart attack but her weight has been stable. 


Her lisinopril was recently increased by cardiology. She has no exertional chest pain, PND, orthopnea, edema, or claudication. 


She has a history of iron deficiency anemia and had refused colonoscopies in the past. At the time of her heart attack she had been intubated and had some coffee grounds noted and also required a blood transfusion. She has not noted any epigastric pain, abdominal pain, melena, or hematochezia. She does take her iron supplements and her stools are dark on the iron supplements. I had discussed with patient and daughter several times that she should get a colonoscopy to evaluate her guaiac iron deficiency anemia but she continues to refuse one. 


Also noted on her admissions was that she had a lung nodule and possible pancreatic mass on CT from 03/2091 and 06/2091. She should get a repeat CT in 12/2091. 


She is not having any abdominal pain. 


She has chronic back pain and osteoarthritis pain. Of note she also had elevated parathyroid levels in the past but refuses to see Endocrinology either in Fayetteville or at United Methodist Behavioral Hospital. 


Please see her medication list which was reviewed with the patient and her daughter. 


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is in no acute distress. Blood pressure 132/70. Neck: Supple without JVD or bruits. Lungs: Clear without wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Cardiac: Rate regularly regular, normal S1 and S2. No S3, S4 or bruits. Abdomen: Mildly obese, soft, nontender. She still has some residual hematoma near her right groin. She has a left femoral artery bruit. The hematoma has significantly decreased in size compared to prior visit. No CCE. Distal pulses intact. 


1. Coronary artery disease. She has no symptoms of decompensated heart failure on her current regimen. Her blood pressure is well controlled with the recent increase in the lisinopril from 20 to 40 mg daily. Check Chem-7. 


Hypomagnesemia. Check followup magnesium level. 


Type 2 diabetes. Her last hemoglobin A1c was 6.1 which is excellent. Continue current medications. 
Iron deficiency anemia. She should have a colonoscopy +/- an upper endoscopy but she declines these procedures. She is aware that we have not ruled out colon cancer or adenomatous colonic polyps or other cause for her iron deficiency anemia. Check CBC. 


History of lung nodule and possible pancreatic mass versus IPMN. These were both stable on imaging from 03/2091 and 06/2091. She needs repeat imaging in 6 months. She will follow up with me in 10/2091 so we can get a flu shot and schedule these procedures.

The patient was seen in conjunction with resident, Dr. Anderson.

 PA's note was reviewed.  The patient was seen and examined by

me.  Please see the PA's note for details of the patient's past

medical, social, family history, review of systems, and physical

exam.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Rash on legs.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 79-year-old man brought in by his

family complaining of a pruritic rash on his bilateral ankles and

today, both ankles are slightly more swollen than usual.  He has

no difficulty breathing, no chest pain.  The patient used to live

in England 4 days ago, arrived in Frankenmuth to live now

permanently with his family here.  He has a history of ""heart

problems for which he is taking Lasix, enalapril, and amlodipine

and is compliant with these medications.  He says initially his

legs were not swollen.  It was only today that the family

happened to notice as he was complaining of a rash that he had

slightly increased swelling of these ankles bilaterally.  The

patient's daughter reports that she bought him new long underwear

and noticed that the rash began where the underwear elastic band

hit his ankles in that similar distribution, there is pruritus

with evidence of excoriation.  He also does have evidence of

chronic venous stasis changes in his legs.  The leg swelling is

equal bilaterally does not extend to the calf and is minimal. 

The patient reports that he coughs when he is out in the cold

Frankenmuth air, but does not produce any sputum.  Has baseline

orthopnea and PND of 3 pillows which has not changed.  He has had

no worsening shortness of breath and no chest pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, TIA.  He has

no history of DVT.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  No significant surgical procedures.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a past smoker, does not drink or use

drugs.  Lives with his family.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative.

ALLERGIES:  Has no allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake, alert, in no distress,

afebrile.  Normal and stable vital signs, saturating 96-97% on

room air.  His exam is unremarkable except for excoriation to the

bilateral ankles with chronic venous stasis changes bilaterally

and trace 1-2+ edema bilaterally equal and the ankles only down

to the mid foot.  He has strong and equal, 2+ dorsalis pedis

pulses in the feet.  The rest of his examination is unremarkable

with clear lungs and breath sounds.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient said has no plans to

get a doctor in America.  He filled out an application

for Frankenmuth Care on arrival to the Emergency Department.  I spoke

with him and his family at length about the need to immediately

get a primary care doctor.  He was given the numbers for the

Tobey Hospital and Heritage Residence.  He has about 3 weeks of his

medications left and he is told that he will need to see ____. 

The family understands the urgency of this situation.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Today is dermatitis.  He is told to continue

his medications as prescribed to elevate the feet to decrease the

swelling.

DISPOSITION:  Discharged in satisfactory condition to follow up

with the primary care physician.

EDVISIT^75659490^ROOT, PERCY^05/15/95^JUSTUS, ELLIS

I saw this patient with Dr. Queen Pickett.  I confirm that I have

interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's

documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the

evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient. 

Please see the resident's note for further details.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Syncopal event.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70-year-old male

with a history of atrial fibrillation for which he is on

Coumadin, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease,

hypertension, and prior transient ischemic attack, who had a

syncopal episode yesterday.  As per report, the patient felt

lightheaded and passed out while he was shaving.  The patient

passed out while using in the bathroom.  The patient was actually

caught by son before he actually hit the floor.  The patient did

not strike his head.  There was no loss of consciousness.  The

patient then awoke once he was supine.  The patient later felt

normal.  The patient states that he did have some antecedent

diaphoresis and shortness of breath and possible chest

palpitations.  The patient states that he felt like something was

jumping inside his body.  The patient does complain of some

fatigue and malaise.  The patient denies having any lower

extremity swelling or pain.  The patient denies having any chest

pain at this time.  The patient did have an adenosine MIBI in

March 2095, which showed some areas of reversible ischemia over

the distribution of the left circumflex artery.  The patient's

transthoracic echocardiogram from March 2095 did show some LVH as

well as for an ejection fraction of 50% with some global

hypokinesis.  The patient was seen by his primary care physician,

specifically, Dr. Ross.  The patient was instructed to come to

the Emergency Department for further evaluation and admission.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's vital signs revealed the

following:  The patient's temperature was 99 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Heart rate 63 beats per minute, respiratory rate 18 breaths per

minute, blood pressure is 151/18, and oxygen saturation was

interpreted as normal.  General:  Mild-to-moderate discomfort

noted, daughter at bedside, pleasant.  HEENT:  The patient's head

is normocephalic and atraumatic, no scalp hematomas.  Mucous

membranes were somewhat dry.  Posterior oropharynx was clear. 

Neck:  Supple, no JVD.  Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation

bilaterally.  No focal rhonchi, rales, or wheezes. 

Cardiovascular:  Irregularly irregular, distant heart sounds, no

definite murmurs, rubs, or gallops were appreciated.  GI: 

Abdomen:  Soft, no rebound or guarding, no focal tenderness to

palpation, no palpable pulsatile mass appreciated.  Rectal exam

deferred.  GU exam deferred.  Skin:  Warm and dry, no rash or

lesions were noted.  Back:  No costovertebral angle tenderness. 

There was no presacral edema.  Extremities:  Warm and well

perfused, trace lower extremity edema noted, no asymmetrical

lower extremity edema.  There were no palpable cords.  Neuro: 

The patient was alert and oriented x3, motor, strength, and

sensation were all grossly intact.  The patient's cranial nerves

are grossly intact.  I did not ambulate the patient.

INITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  The patient is a 70-year-old male

with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart

failure, prior transient ischemic attack, and atrial fibrillation

for which he is on Coumadin, who presents with a syncopal

episode.  The patient was sent in to the Emergency Department for

further evaluation and workup for this syncopal event. 

Differential diagnosis at this time includes a syncopal event

secondary to dehydration versus arrhythmia.  I do not feel that

the patient had a cerebrovascular accident.  The patient will

need to have screening laboratory studies and formal imaging.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Upon arrival to the Emergency

Department, the patient had history and physical exam performed. 

The patient then had a 12-lead EKG performed.  The patient's

12-lead EKG was consistent with atrial fibrillation with some

T-wave flattening noted.  There were no definite acute ischemic

changes appreciated.  The patient had laboratory studies sent. 

The patient's laboratory studies were notable for a creatinine of

1.69.  The patient does have a history of renal insufficiency. 

The patient's cardiac markers were negative.  The patient's BNP

was elevated at 1380.  The patient's complete blood count was

normal.  The patient's coagulation studies were normal patient's

coagulation studies were notable for an INR of 2.2.  The patient

then had a noncontrast head CT scan performed.  The patient's

noncontrast head CT scan results are still pending at this time. 

The patient also had a 2-view chest x-ray ordered.  The patient's

chest x-ray results are also still pending at this time.  Dr.

Ross kindly and promptly saw the patient here in the Emergency

Department.  He was in agreement with admitting the patient to

Internal Medicine at this time.  The patient will be admitted

to a monitor bed.  The patient will need to rule out for possible

acute coronary syndrome or cardiac ischemia.  The patient will

need further monitoring for possible arrhythmia.  The patient was

in agreement with this plan for admission at this time.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSES:

1.  Syncopal event, possibly secondary to an arrhythmia.

2.  Atrial fibrillation.

3.  Renal insufficiency.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was admitted to Internal Medicine

and to a monitor bed.

CONDITION AT THE TIME OF DISPOSITION:  Stable and satisfactory.

Dear Dr. Regan: 


I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Percy Root in the Cardiovascular Clinic at the Shady Brook Hospital today.  As you know, he is a 70-year-old man who is s/p CABG in May of this year. Today he is doing well folloing his surgery . 



His past medical history is significant for a coronary artery disease, status post IMI,afib,  CABG, PPM,  hypertension, hyperlipidemia, question of an old stroke.  His current medications include aspirin 81 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, lisinorpill 40 mg, Toprol-XL 10 mg, Prilosec 20 mg, Zocor 40 mg, Hydralazine.Coumadin as directed.


Allergies:  No known drug allergies.


He lives in Claxton with his wife, daughter, and grandkids and son-in-law.  He does not drink, smoke or use IV drugs.  He is originally from England.  


Family History:  noncontributory.


On physical examination, his heart rate was 60 and regular,  his blood pressure was 125/70.  Carotids are 2+, good upstrokes, no bruits.  Jugular venous pressure was flat.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  He had a regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border.  Abdomen was benign.  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema of the extremities. Good peripheral pulses.





In summary, this is a 70-year-old man with coronary artery disease,  At this time he is NYHA II. Hre appears a bit volume overloaded. I will add ACE and lasix. Follow up in 1 month.

 Attending Note


I performed a history and neurological examination of the patient and discussed his management with the resident.  I reviewed the resident's note and agree with his documented findings and plan of care.


The patient is a 71 year old man with HTN, DM and high cholesterol, PPM on coumadin for AF, glaucoma, who presented 4 w/a with R facial droop and dysarthria lasting &lt; 1 minute.  Was admitted for TIA w/u and CT scan was negative.  CTA was also normal.  He had had a similar episode in the UK in the past. Was started on a statin and ASA and discharged.  His wife feels he may not be that compliant but his INR was 2.3 today.  It had been 2 when he came in with the TIA&gt;


The exam today showed:
Acuity was 20/70 OD and Hand motions OS.
Left APD
Fundi with large C/D OD and diffuse pallor OS with an opticociliary shunt vessel along the nasal disc.
Right facial weakness in the sense of eyebrow drop and less wrinkles in the forehead but smile equal.  Was not in UMN fashion.
Motor, sensory, gait otherwise normal.


Assessment:  
Status post TIA possibly related to AF

Left optic neuropathy with signs of chronic compression or ischemia.  The latter is more likely cause (especially since I did not see any mass lesion compressing the L optic nerve on the CT) and is proably secondary to glaucoma.


Plan:
Reviewed coumadin food rules with him.
Continue 
ASA and coumadin and statin
Continued HTN and DM control
Will touch base with ophthalmology regarding the left optic neuropathy

Return in 6 months.

         CELLS.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

76 year old female with three days of painless BRBPR, also reports of black stool, history of PUD.  Source of bleeding not clear.  Pattern most typical of LGIB, likely diverticular with significant decline in hematocrit, painless, moderate volume BRBPR.  Agree no real pain for ischemic colitis, though wbc elevated.  No fevers, chills, other GI symptoms or exposure for infectious colitis.  Given black stools, aspirin use, history of PUD, upper bleed also possible, though presentation with red blood and hemodynamic stability atypical for this.  Given insecurity in type of bleed, agree with both EGD and colonoscopy.  



EGD and colonoscopy this morning

Hold aspirin

Continue QD PPI

If hematocrit drops further, would transfuse 1-2 units to hct of 28-30

Dear Dr.  Morgan:



  Thank you very much for your referral of Gabrielle Oreilly for evaluation of coronary artery disease and a right coronary artery aneurysm as documented on CT scanning.  She is a 77-year-old woman with longstanding history of tobacco use of greater than 100-pack years quitting approximately eight years ago. She suffers from hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, and what appears to be a recent diagnosis of COPD. She has always been very limited in her activity suffering from back pain, and has never been in any type of regular exercise routine. She recently has noticed dyspnea on exertion over the past two to three months and has been treated with several prednisone tapers as well as an albuterol nebulizer at home and an albuterol inhaler. With these treatments, her dyspnea improved, but would worsen as the steroids were tapered.  She does report some episodes of chest heaviness, which she describes as a heavy feeling in her chest, which will last for minutes at a time. These are not exertionally related and are occurring approximately once per week. She was placed on Nexium with some improvement, but does feel as if she will still develop these episodes. 



To further evaluate her symptoms of persistent cough and shortness of breath, she underwent a CT scan to evaluate for pulmonary embolus. This was performed on 05/20/2101 and did not show any evidence of PE, however, there was coronary artery calcification with plaque noted in the left main coronary artery. There was a focal 9 mm aneurysm of the right coronary artery. She was then referred to me for further evaluation.



			Past medical history:

   Hypertension. 

Hyperlipidemia. 

Glucose intolerance. 

Left bundle branch block. 

Diverticular bleed. 

Gastroesophageal reflux disease. 

Hypothyroidism. 

COPD.



Current Medications:

 prednisone taper

hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg qd

potassium chloride 10 mEq qd

lisinopril 30 mg qd

aspirin 81 mg qd

calcium supplement 600 mg qd

levothyroxine 25 mcg qd

Lipitor 10 mg qd

Celexa 40 mg qd

albuterol inhaler; Dir: and nebulizer

multivitamins



Allergies:

			

Allergy   She reports receiving Halothane gas remotely with the development of jaundice at the time of her hysterectomy.

Drug allergy   Halothane gas, which caused hepatitis per her report.



			Family history:

   Notable for her father with myocardial infarction at 54.  Mother with ""an enlarged heart,"" who died at 82.



			Social history:

   She quit smoking eight years ago, previously smoked two packs per day for 35 years.  She lives alone but her daughter lives above her in the same building.



			Review of systems:

   She denies any significant change in weight.  She has intermittent headaches relieved with Advil.  She reports chronic cough and wheeze, which has been improved on prednisone.  She has shortness of breath with exertion but denies exertional chest pain.  No lower extremity edema, palpitations, or dizzy spells.  She reports her reflux symptoms are improved on her Nexium.  She has no history of stroke, no history of anemia.  She reports her sugars have been diet controlled.  Otherwise extended review of systems was negative.



Physical examination:

			

-Pulse:   70

-BP: 142/70  

-General:   She is an elderly woman in no distress and comfortable at rest

-Skin:   Free of rashes

-Heent:   benign

-Neck:   JVP was at 5.  She had 2+ carotids without bruits

-Chest:   Lungs are clear without significant wheeze

-Cardiac:   Regular, S1 and S2 without murmurs

-Abdomen:   Soft with a nontender reducible ventral hernia

-Extremities:   She had no edema in her extremities with 2+ distal pulses

-Neuro:   She is alert and oriented

-weight:   185 pounds



			EKG:

    demonstrated sinus rhythm at 70 with a left bundle branch block.



			Assessment and plan:

   Gabrielle Oreilly has multiple risk factors for coronary disease including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, a positive family history, and heavy tobacco use in the past. She presently has had recurrent bouts of a COPD flare, which has been responsive to prednisone and albuterol nebulizer therapy. Her chest CT scan demonstrates plaque in the left main coronary artery as well as a right coronary artery aneurysm. I do believe she needs further evaluation first by functional study, and I will arrange an adenosine stress test and consider cardiac catheterization to further define her anatomy with her multiple high-risk features and abnormalities as seen on her recent CT scan. She will continue a slow taper with possible addition of other inhalers to control her COPD.



Plan: 

1. Adenosine MIBI to evaluate for ischemia in distributions of the left system as well as the RCA aneurismal segment. 

2. Treatment of her emphysema as per your office. 

3. I will see her again in follow up in one month and consider cardiac catheterization for further evaluation. 

4. I have instructed her to proceed to the emergency room with the development of any significant chest pain or progressive shortness of breath.

Pulmonary Consult by Dr. Trujillo for management of PE

I have seen and examined the patient and agree with the history including HPI, PMHx, Meds, All, Family Hx, ROS; Pexam, labs, studies, assessment and plan as per Dr. Chavez.

Briefly, 78 YO female with recent hip fracture in 8/01 (not surgically repaired) who did well until 3 days PTA when she developed sudden onset CP, non-productive cough and was noted to have RA sat of 89%.  In ED, patient was hemodynamically stable.  CTPE protocol bilateral PE   s in both main PA   s and clot in LLE DV system.  Patient was started on UF heparin.  

PMHx notable for NSTEMI, diffuse CAD, left pleural mass followed by Fidious, COPD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, took coumadin after surgery 30 years ago 

Meds include:  Advair, Lipitor, HCTZ, heparin

Smoked 50 pk-years, quit 8 years ago.

Family hx notable for:  Son passed away in    01 with blood clots.

Pexam:
Sats 94% on 4L, T 98, P 78, BP 186/86 R 20
Gen Comfortable.
O/P Clear
Heart RRR no m/g/r
Lungs decreased BS throughout
Ext:  Superficial varicosities, minimal bilateral edema

Labs notable for:  WBC 15
Trop 0.22
Ntbnp 500

CT scan     multiple large central PE   s and bilateral upper and lower arteries; +emphysema; clot in left popliteal and distal and superficial femoral veins.

ECHO     EF 60%, mod TR RA dilation, RVSP>=54; RV hypokinetic, PFO with R   shunting   (increased RVSP, RA size since last ECHO)

Impression:

Large bilateral PE, hemodynamically stable
Evidence of RV strain, elevated cardiac enzymes, BNP which when combined put patient in risk group for increased mortality
Persistent DVT
PFO with right to left shunt
COPD

Recs:

Recommend retrievable IVC filter.  Rationale is that the patient has persistent clot in LE   s and has a PFO with right to left shunt and is at risk for CVA (though filter will not prevent small clots from embolizing) and that +cardiac enzymes, BNP, and ECHO place patient in risk group for increased mortality.
Do not recommend lytics in that patient is hemodynamically stable and risks for hemorrhage outweigh potential benefits in our opinion.
Can change to low molecular weight heparin.
Hypercoag w/u
Start spiriva, albuterol for COPD



Thanks for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient,

Mr. Villegas is seen today.  I have not seen him since November. 
About three weeks ago he stopped his Prednisone on his own because
he was gaining weight.  He does feel that his shoulders are
definitely improved.  It is unclear what he is actually taking, but
I think based on the color of his pills and the timing of the
medication that he continues taking his Atenolol for hypertension
and 1 Hydroxychloroquine tablet.  He is concerned because of the
relatively recent onset of difficulties turning his head to the
right.  When he does this, he will note that he feels as though he
is going to pass out although this has not actually happened.  This
only occurs when he turns to the right and not to the left.  He has
no visual changes otherwise and denies any headache or other
cranial complaints.  
 
On examination today, BP 120/80.  He has no bruits over the
carotid.  He has no tenderness in this region either.  He has good
peripheral pulses at the arms.  His joint examination is much
improved with better ROM of the shoulders and no peripheral joint
synovitis.  
 
Clinical Impression:
 
#1:  Inflammatory arthritis - possibly RA - with response noted to
Hydroxychloroquine along with Prednisone.  He has stopped the
Prednisone, and I would not restart it yet.  
 
#2:  New onset of symptoms suspicious for right-sided carotid
disease.  Will arrange for carotid ultrasound studies.  Patient
advised to call me if he develops any worsening symptoms.  He has
been taking 1 aspirin per day prophylaxis long-term, and I stressed
that he continue to do so.  He will follow-up with me shortly after
the ultrasound study.

Reason for Visit

Sternal pain.



History of Present Illness

71 yo M with CAD, s/p CABG x 4 in 3/80. He presents with pain over the lower part of his chest since Monday-- came on when he was in bed. The pain is located in a specific spot over his breast bone, and is present all the time, worse with coughing, sneezing, or sudden deep breath. No change with exertion-- did his usual exercises (stretching, leg lifts, crunching) yesterday without a problem. No variation with food. No change with position (e.g., leaning forward). Denies productive cough, fever, chills, nausea, diaphoresis, palpitations. No radiation to the jaw or arm. The pain does not remind him of his sx prior to CABG (which he says was exertional SOB), but does feel like his incisional pain after the surgery (which eventually went away completely).

 

ROS as above, otherwise negative in detail. He says his pain is currently gone, and he feels fine lying back in the exam room.

      Neck

No visible JVD.

No cervical nodes.



      Chest

Lungs clear, good air movement, no crackles, wheezes. No focal rhonchi. No pleural rub.

+ focal tenderness approx 2-3 cm above the xiphoid-- subcutaneous tissue feels a little thicker here, but no fluctuance, erythema, warmth. No sternal movement wiht palpation. No palpable sternal wire.



      Cor/Cardiac

RRR, + systolic murmur, no rub. ?S4.

      Abdomen

Soft, ND, NT. + bowel sounds.

      Extremity

Warm. No edema.



Lab Test

ECG (today): sinus at 60 bpm, nl axis. IVCD (toward RBBB, but does not meet criteria); inverted Ts in II, III, AVF. Compared with 8/79-- the QRS complex is slightly narrower.



Impression

Sternal pain-- non-exertional, reproducible by palpation, and not accompanied by ECG changes-- in pt who is s/p CABG seven months ago. Sx are different from his original anginal pain-- and I suspect he has some sort of focal inflammation / contusion over the lower part of the sternotomy site. No sign, currently, of local or systemic infection. Doubt pneumonia (no cough or fever, lungs clear) or GI cause. Pericarditis a possibility (he had post-op pericarditis after his CABG), but no signs on ECG, and the pain is not positional.

 

Discussed the case with the pt's cardiologist, Dr. Xavier Rush-- and we came up with the following plan:





Plan

- will send CK/MB/Tn x 1-- although cards agrees that likelihood that this is cardiac seems low

- check CXR

- send ESR, CBC/Diff

- OK for pt to go home after labs drawn and CXR done

- will contact Dr. Thorne's service (cardiac surgery) and Dr. Perez (PCP) to make them aware

- instructed pt to go to the ED immediately for increased pain, SOB, fever, or swelling/redness over the lower sternum

OROZCO,KYLE   560-40-78-5                     VISIT DATE: 08/26/83

This is a preliminary dictation. 

PRESENTING COMPLAINT and HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 

patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of hypertension and 

diabetes who presents with fever and chills.  He is four weeks 

status post revision of an aorto-bifemoral bypass graft, which got 

infected and had to be revised.  He has been doing well, but now 

presents here with a low-grade fever to 100.9 degrees F. (he states 

his maximum temperature at home was 101 degrees F., while he was 

taking Advil for the fever).  He presents for evaluation.  He has 

had no drainage from the site, and has been home on IV Nafcillin 

for the past two months secondary to his graft infection. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above. 

MEDICATIONS:  IV Nafcillin, Lasix, Zocor, and insulin. 

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The vital signs include a blood pressure of 

179/85, a pulse of 91, respirations of 20, and a fever to 100.9 

degrees F.  The HEENT examination is normal.  There are some 

crackles at the left base, but the lungs are otherwise normal.  The 

heart has a regular rate and rhythm.  The abdomen is soft and 

non-tender, with good bowel sounds.  There is a right groin mass, 

questionably a hematoma, with good pulses however.  The extremities 

are well-perfused. 

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine are 

normal.  The blood sugar is 180.  The white count is normal at 3.7. 

The hematocrit is 29.  The PT/PTT are pending.  The urinalysis is 

negative so far, with microscopic pending. 

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen by Surgery. 

The consensus was to order a CT scan of the abdomen, since the 

patient had a fever at that point, and so the CT scan is pending. 

Thus, the assessment was that this was a 58-year-old male with a 

history of a recent revision of an aorto-bifemoral bypass graft, 

who had been on two months of IV Nafcillin, and who presented with 

a fever.  Laboratory studies are done and cultures sent.  A Surgery 

consultation and abdominal CT scan were ordered, and results were 

pending.  The patient was admitted to the Emergency Department 

Observation Unit awaiting the scan, full evaluation, and 

disposition.  The patient was signed out to the 3 p.m. attending. 

CONSULTATIONS (INCLUDING PCP):  Surgery. 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Fever. 

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 

admitted to the Emergency Department Observation Unit in stable 

condition.

INTERVAL HISTORY:  The patient is status post one lumbar epidural
injection.  He is 61 years old with previous history of diabetes,
as well as bilateral fem-pop surgery.  He has pain radiating to
both legs up to calves and thighs.  He has moderate-to-severe
spinal stenosis.  He had good response to L5-S1 epidural steroid
injection once, about 3 months ago.  He states that he is
reasonably symptom free but the pain is coming back.  Today, we
are going to repeat the injection.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Essentially unchanged from prior.

PROCEDURE NOTE:  After obtaining informed consent, the patient
placed in sitting position.  Lower back prepped and draped in
usual sterile fashion.  A 17-gauge, Weiss needle used to access
epidural space at L5-S1.  Three cc of Depo-Medrol and 3 cc of
0.5% lidocaine were allowed to drip in via gravity.  No
complications.  No heme, no CSF.  No paresthesia.

FOLLOW-UP PLAN:  The patient to report for further injection in
case needed in the next 2 or 3 months.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 46 year old male 
with complaints of chest pain and throat tightness.  The patient 
reported that he was stuck in traffic for about 12 hours last night 
and apparently got very tense.  He felt some heat from his car, 
thought that it was overheating, and then developed some chest pain 
and throat tightness.  He really described what seems to be 
fleeting chest tightness and no diaphoresis, no shortness of 
breath, and no arm numbness or tingling.  However, he did have one 
associated symptom of some throat tightness. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has had a stress test one year 
ago that was normal.  He had an echocardiogram at that time that 
was also normal. 
MEDICATIONS:  Claritin, Proventil, and cimetidine. 
ALLERGIES:  Morphine sulfate. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  The patient is afebrile. 
Vital signs are normal.  HEENT:  Normal.  NECK:  Supple.  LUNGS: 
Clear bilaterally.  CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm without 
murmur.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and non-tender.  EXTREMITIES:  Negative. 
No CVA tenderness. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  EKG shows normal sinus rhythm.  There is no 
change in his electrocardiogram.  Chest x-ray is clear.  CK is 155. 
Troponin is 0.13.  Electrolytes are normal.  BUN and creatinine are 
20 and 1.0.  Hematocrit is 39, white count normal. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient is a 46 year old male 
with a fleeting episode of chest pain and throat tightness while 
stuck in traffic.  He was seen at Southwest Texas Medical Center and 
then sent here appearing somewhat anxious, with a normal physical 
examination, normal EKG, normal chest x-ray, and normal metabolic 
panel.  Most likely low probability for ischemia.  Risk factors are 
also very low. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):   The patient is 
going to be admitted to the Short Stay Unit for a rule out MI 
protocol and possibly for another ETT.

Dear Dr. Law:

I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Hess in followup in Cardiology today.  As you know, he is a 53-year-old gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on 02/11/60 for presyncope and pauses on Holter monitoring.  His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma.  Prior to his pacemaker placement, an exercise stress test was performed because of his history of exertional chest pain.  He was able to exercise for 8 minutes and 4 seconds.  The test was terminated for 7/10 substernal chest pain, but no hypotension and no overt EKG changes were noted, so we proceeded with the pacemaker implant.  Since the implant Mr. Hess describes that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness and shortness of breath have vanished, however, he has noticed that he is sleeping less well and occasionally has nocturnal palpitations, which potentially could represent pacing from his pacemaker.

Interrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa QQ 626 pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction.  His estimated battery longevity is 89 months.  The atrial impedance is 569 ohms, the ventricular impedance is 529 ohms.  The P-wave is 5.6 mV.  The R-wave is 31.3 mV.  The threshold in the atrium is 0.75 V at 0.4 mV, and the threshold in the ventricle is 0.75 V at 0.4 msec.

In summary, Mr. Hess is doing extremely well after his pacemaker placement.  His pacemaker incision is extremely well healed.  There is no sign of erythema or hematoma.  However, his sinus tachycardia is mildly perplexing.  Looking at his heart rate histogram, it appears that this sinus rates have varied from 80-120 beats per minute for the most part aside from some low heart rate that potentially are nocturnal.  I have performed some pacing maneuvers today in clinic to attempt to determine whether the mechanism of his current tachycardia is sinus and it appears that this is sinus tachycardia.  For this reason, I have performed a TSH today, which is normal, however, I suggest to you that potentially a cursory endocrine workup and potentially a repeat echocardiogram at your facility might be indicated.  I am available to discuss these findings with you at any time.  I plan to see Mr. Hess in followup in three months' time, and if any issues arise in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Gordon:



I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Hess in followup in Cardiology today.  As you know, he is a 54-year-old gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on 02/11/2060 for his presyncope and pauses on Holter monitoring.



His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma.  Prior to his pacemaker placement, an exercise stress test was performed because of a history of exertional chest pain.  He was able to exercise for 8 minutes and 4 seconds.  The test was terminated for 7/10 substernal chest pain, but no hypotension or overt ECG changes were noted.  We proceeded to pacemaker implant and Mr. Hess has done well since that time.  He remarks that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness have resolved.  However, he occasionally still has nocturnal palpitations as well as occasional exertional chest discomfort.  He tells me that he underwent testing at Wheatland Memorial consisting of a stress test with MIBI imaging that perhaps showed an abnormality, though the report of this test is not available to me today for review.



Interrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa CTE 226 pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction.  The estimated longevity on the battery life is 95 months.  The atrial impedance is 544 ohms and the ventricular impedance is 519 ohms.  The P-wave in the atrium is 5.6 mV and the R-wave in the ventricle is 31 mV.  The threshold in the atrium is stable at 0.5 V at 0.4 msec, and the threshold in the ventricle is also stable at 0.5 V at 0.4 msec.



In summary, the pacemaker appears to be working quite well.  However, Mr. Hess persists in a perplexing sinus tachycardia that has been present since his last pacemaker interrogation.  I have therefore ordered an echocardiogram to rule out any ill effects of the sinus tachycardia or any structural heart disease that may be causing the sinus tachycardia.  In addition, I have performed a 12-lead ECG, which appears to show sinus mechanism rather than an atrial tachycardia.  Today in the office, his sinus rate is 109 beats per minute with stable blood pressure.  Mr. Hess and I have checked thyroid studies in the recent past and those have been unremarkable.  



I have discussed this case with Dr. Quatrell Swanson who has agreed to assist in Cardiology care for Mr. Hess in the near future, since Dr. Law is moving his practice to the NCHC.  I plan to see Mr. Hess in followup in three months' time for his pacemaker.  If any issues arise in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.



Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Swanson:



I had the pleasure of caring for Clarence Hess at BCH 08/04-03/07.  He is a 54-year-old man with obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension, S/P dual-chamber pacemaker placement by Dr. Una Trujillo in February, 2060.  He complained of fatigue and exertional throat tightness and a nuclear stress test in June, 2060, revealed apical ischemia and an ejection fraction of 70 percent.  Cardiac catheterization performed by Dr. Leslie Campbell on 08/04/60 via the right radial artery revealed a right dominant system, a tight lesion in the proximal LAD, and no other focally occlusive disease.  He received a 3mm stent, postdilated to 3.5mm, with an excellent angiographic result.  



He spent an uneventful night without complaints, ambulating and voiding without difficulty.  His right wrist was stable, and his hand warm and well perfused.  Morning labs included a BUN of 16, creatinine 0.9, negative cardiac enzymes, hematocrit 36.4, platelets 238,000, cholesterol 182, HDL 37, LDL 91 and triglycerides 269.  He was discharged home on aspirin, 325mg po qd; Plavix, 75mg po qd, to be continued for at least six months according to the research trial protocol; atenolol, 50mg po qd; Lipitor, 80mg po qd; Prilosec, 20mg po qd; Proventil, two puffs qid; and sublingual nitroglycerin, prn chest pain.  We've asked him to see you in the next couple of weeks, and to call if he has questions before then.  He also will follow up with the research staff per protocol guidelines.  Thank you for allowing us to participate in his care.  Please don't hesitate to call with questions.



Sincerely,

HESS, CLARENCE
64365595
07/08/2060


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He has not had recurrent angina.  Unfortunately, we did not connect back in December following the receipt of his lipid data that included a marked and unacceptable LDL elevation.  We had left a message with his daughter, Lea.  Additional laboratory data at that time included a hemoglobin A1c of 6.2%.

He is seeking to establish a new relationship with a primary care physician through Barney Convalescent Hospital.  He has also had problems of at least 2 years duration with erectile dysfunction and decreased libido.

MEDICATIONS:  His medications are atenolol 50 mg b.i.d., atorvastatin 80 mg daily, ezetimibe 10 mg daily, Ecotrin 325 mg daily, Prilosec 20 mg daily.  He apparently ran out of his clopidogrel some time ago and did not renew the prescription.  It was his understanding that he was to remain on this medication for only six months following the PCI procedure.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His heart rate at rest is 105.  His initial blood pressure 149/96, but then 150/82 on repeat, using a large cuff.  His weight is down 4 pounds to 193.  His venous pressure and carotid upstrokes are normal.  His lung fields are clear.  He has no cardiac murmur.  There are no pulse deficits or peripheral edema.

His ECG shows a sinus tachycardia (after rushing into the office) and an incomplete right bundle-branch block pattern with a normal QRS duration.  In comparison with his tracing from 12/24/2060, his resting heart rate has increased.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  He will keep a diary of blood pressure and heart rate recordings over the next month on the basis of which we will determine next steps.  It is possible that the higher dose beta-blocker contributes to his erectile dysfunction, though the problem may have antedated this medication altogether.  We will refer him to the practice of Dr. Ohara and Dr. Xiao, as well as to Dr. Sutherland, the latter specifically to help us evaluate his longstanding erectile dysfunction.

He will continue his efforts at weight loss.  He is working out at the gym 2-3 times per week.

evidence of an infection, no evidence of a pneumonia.  Because of 

his abdominal distention, a KUB was done but there was no evidence 

of air fluid levels and no evidence of intestinal obstruction.  He 

had a lot of gas but otherwise normal.  There was also no evidence 

of constipation.  Electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm with some 

nonspecific ST and T-wave changes.  Old electrocardiogram was 

compared with new one and there was no significant change.  His 

white count was 14,000 with a hematocrit of 36.  His electrolytes, 

BUN and creatinine as well as blood sugar was normal.  Amylase and 

lipase, also normal.  Liver function tests, normal.  Urinalysis 

showed too numerous to count white cells and also has bacteria.    

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  Management in the emergency 

department consisted of IV fluids.  Blood cultures and urine 

cultures were sent.  The patient was immediately started on 

intravenous antibiotics, was given Tylenol, placed on oxygen and 

was being hydrated.  Again, a urine culture was sent as well as 

blood cultures.  A 51-year-old man with a history of multiple 

sclerosis, bedridden, also has a history of hypertension who has 

been experiencing fever, chills, tachycardia, tachypnea and mental 

status change over the last twenty-four hours at his nursing home 

who presents now with urosepsis.  Cultures done, antibiotics given, 

IV fluids given, Tylenol given.  Vital signs are normalizing.

CONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  Medical.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Urosepsis. 

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 

going to be admitted to the medical service.  The patient is 

admitted to the medical service in stable condition.  Primary care 

physician is aware.

I saw this patient in conjunction with Dr. Otis. I confirm

that I have interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the

resident's documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed

the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 55-year-old male with vomiting.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient with end-stage multiple

sclerosis as well as neurogenic bladder and chronic indwelling

Foley who presents from the nursing home after 4 episodes of

vomiting since 10:00 a.m.  He has had also progressive abdominal

distention, he reports over the last 3-4 weeks.  Nursing note

also reports decreased urine output for the last 2 days.  He had

a KUB done at the referring facility that demonstrated a question

of a small bowel obstruction but this film was not sent with him.

 He also had a fever today per report.  The patient denies any

abdominal pain, shortness of breath, chest pain, or other

complaints.  He does have a history of an ileus and prior

admissions for urosepsis with levofloxacin resistant E. coli.  He

reports a mild cough.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for hypertension, multiple

sclerosis, anemia, decubitus ulcers, neurogenic bladder, and

urethral strictures.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  He is status post urethral stenting.

Social history, family history, and review of systems are as per

written note.

MEDICATIONS:  Prozac, Actonel, ferrous sulfate, aspirin,

multivitamins, lisinopril, Lipitor, and Prilosec.

ALLERGIES:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert, generally

chronically ill appearing, quite pleasant.  Vital signs are

within normal limits as documented except for an elevated pulse

rate of 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24, room air

saturations of 93% and a temperature of 99.2.  For full physical

exam findings, please see the resident's written note. 

Specifically, HEENT exam is atraumatic.  There is a 1-cm ulcer on

roof of his mouth.  He has synechiae of his pupils that are 2 mm

and nonreactive.  His extraocular movements are not alignment. 

Neck exam is normal as documented.  Respiratory exam reveals

scattered bronchi.  There is no chest wall tenderness. 

Cardiovascular exam reveals tachycardia without murmur. 

Abdominal exam is distinctly distended and slightly firm with

hypoactive bowel sounds but no tenderness, no rebound or

guarding.  Skin is intact, warm, and dry on my exam. 

Musculoskeletal exam is nontender with no edema or bony point

tenderness.  Neurologically, the patient has increased tone in

his lower extremities and weakness of all of his extremities. 

His mood and affect is normal but he is dysarthric.  He is

neurologically, however, appears to be at his baseline.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC and electrolytes remarkable for white blood

count 16.2, BUN and creatinine ratio of 40 and 1.0 respectively. 

Last creatinine was 0.5.  LFTs and lipase are within normal

limits as documented.  INR is 1.1.

IMAGING STUDIES:  EKG demonstrates sinus rhythm with nonspecific

ST-T wave changes.  Plain films of the abdomen demonstrates

scattered dilated loops of small bowel but no clear obstruction

consistent with possible ileus versus early obstruction.  Chest

x-ray shows low lung volumes without any focal consolidation.

IMPRESSION:  This is a patient with abdominal distention, is

quite impressive as well as a firm belly with dilated loops of

bowel on his KUB as well as history of vomiting earlier this

evening.  He has had no vomiting here and does not feel

nauseated, however, does not have an appetite.  He has had

decreased urine output and managed to put out a total 25 cc of

urine through his Foley since 2:00 p.m. today.  Presently, he was

not tender over his bladder.  Upon flushing the Foley, there is a

large amount of debris.  They came out and followed by high

pressure urine that had malodorous character to it.  I think this

patient likely has an ileus and urinary tract infection.  He

received antibiotics wide spectrum including vancomycin,

levofloxacin and Flagyl initially followed by gentamicin given

his prior levofloxacin resistance.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Urinary tract infection.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Ileus versus SBO.

The patient was admitted to the ED Observation Area for CT

imaging, however will eventually require admission for this

problem likely to Medicine Service.

DISPOSITION:  Admitted to ED Observation Unit.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever.

I saw this patient with Dr. Edwards.  Please see his note for

further details.  I confirm that I have interviewed and examined

the patient, reviewed the resident's documentation, and

discussed, plan of care, and disposition with the patient. 

History is obtained through discussion with the patient who says

yes or no, as well as transporting paramedics.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old

gentleman with end-stage MS at nursing home.  He has indwelling

Foley catheter.  He was transported from nursing home to ED as he

has had a fever today to approximately 100.5.  Per EMS, they were

told that the patient has also been more lethargic with decreased

POs today.  He received Tylenol and defervesced somewhat.  He

then received 400 mL of fluid en route and he has become more

awake and alert.  He is telling the paramedics that he is at his

baseline.  He denies to me any headaches, neck pain.  No chest

pain, shortness of breath, no abdominal pain, no cough, no fevers

or chills.  He reports that he is able to discern when he has

abdominal pain.  He has intact sensation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As per HPI.  In addition, CAD, diabetes,

hypertension, CHF.

Please see resident note for list of medication and allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He does not smoke.  He does not drink.  He is at

a nursing home.  He is married.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per resident note and my HPI.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake, alert, and nontoxic, in no

distress.  Afebrile, pulse in 90s, respiratory 18, blood pressure

102/66, O2 saturation 99% on room air.  HEENT exam: 

Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Neck:  Supple.  He has coarse

upper airway sounds bilaterally anteriorly.  Heart is regular

rate and rhythm.  His abdomen is slightly distended.  He is

nontender.  He has sacral decubitus ulcers that are well healing,

no evidence of acute infection, contractures in his lower

extremities.  He is alert and does say yes or no to questions.

The most likely etiology in this patient for an infection is his

urinary tract infection.  His urine and his catheter was cloudy. 

Prior to sending the urine for evaluation for urinalysis to the

lab, the patient had his catheter changed.  He then began to no

longer drain urine.  Accordingly, a bladder probe was put on

using ultrasound and clearly showed a distended bladder. 

Attempts were made to change the catheter, but they were

unsuccessful.  There was pus found at the meatus.  At this point,

the patient is awaiting a CT scan of his abdomen and urology

evaluation.  He is also receiving antibiotics for presumed UTI

and/or abscess.

LABORATORY DATA:  Include sodium 136, K 4.5, chloride 102,

bicarbonate 22, BUN 22, creatinine 0.45, and glucose 136.  LFTs

within normal limits.  Normal lipase.  White count of 5.7,

hematocrit 35.5, and platelet count 306,000.  Coags within normal

limits.  UA again is pending at this time.

He will be admitted to the hospital.  I attempted to reach the

patient's primary care physician, Dr. Earle to contact from the

WBM office, however, my calls went unanswered.  At this point, I

am signing out the patient and he is awaiting his CT scan and

urology evaluation.

DIAGNOSIS:  Urinary infection, mild dehydration, end-stage MS.

CONDITION:  Stable.

DISPOSITION:  Will be admitted.

Personal Data and Overall Health	

75 year old right handed man with pure motor hemiparesis synrdrome on right from L IC stroke in 6/32.



History of Present Illness	

Mr. Slater comes to the stroke clinic today for an initial visit and second opinion for left-sided weakness starting in 6/25/32. He was golfing at the time, and suddenly developed weakness with no sensory changes. The weakness involved the face, arm and leg on the left side only. He went to Gilmore Hospital, where they checked his blood pressure, and found it to be 220/140 (per his report). A CT scan was performed, and he was informed that it was normal. He became frustrated with the ER there and signed out AMA. He went to the HCH at Easton 2 days later, his BP was still elevated, and they started him on clonidine. They attempted to arrange for a renal angiogram to work up his hypertension, but he declined. No further stroke/TIA workup was performed.



He comes to me for a second opinion regarding his workup. His weakness has greatly improved, but not back to normal. He has never had sensory changes, and no speech difficulties, anosognosia, neglect, or gait instability. He did have ""flashing lights in both eyes"" for fifteen minutes at the onset of the symptoms on the golf course, but none since then. He has never had transient monocular blindness, diplopia, or suddenly blurry vision.



Past Medical History	

Hypertension.

He is being worked up for possible renal artery stenosis. 

He has not had his cholesterol checked.



Medications	    

PROPRANOLOL (PROPRANOLOL HCL)	 40MG PO BID Start Date: 10/1/32

Sensation: intact to LT, PP, temp, vib, PS throughout. 

Coord: nl FNF, HKS bilaterally. Gait normal-based, good toe, heel and tandem walk. 

DTR's: 2 throughout, toes downgoing.



Plan	

I have reviewed Mr. Slater's CT scan, and he has a lacunar infarct of the left posterior internal capsule, which explains his pure motor hemiparesis syndrome. I have counseled him that most likely the best treatment for this type of stroke is to control his hypertension, and to use antiplatelet agents. I have asked that he increase his dose of ASA to 325 mg per day.



In addition, he needs a work up. I have arranged for him to have CNIS, 24 hour Holter monitoring, and TTE with bubble study. Additionally, we should check fasting lipids. 



He wishes to have a PCP at FPC, and I have requested that he have the next available appointment with Dr. Harry Tolliver of the cardiology department, who could also be instrumental in adjusting his hypertension meds. 



He will return to clinic in 2-3 months, and is to page me immediately with any new symptoms or concerns. 



CC	

Dr. Harry Tolliver, FPC cardiology unit.","Record date: 2132-12-31

Personal Data and Overall Health	

75-year-old S/P L internal capsule stroke 6/32.



Reason for Visit	

Mr. Slater returns to clinic today for routine follow up. I last saw him on 10/1/2132, and he has continued to improvesince that time. He remains on ASA 325mg po qd for stroke prevention, and continues to be worked up for renovascular hypertension. He has had no new stroke-like symptoms, and only very infrequently feels that the right leg is weak, usually at the end of the day when he is fatigued. He was recently seen by Dr. Harry Tolliver of the department of Cardiology. He underwent a 24-hour holter monitor, which showed no evidence for atrial fibrillation or other significant dysrhythmia. His CNIS have no evidence for disease. He is to go for his TTE with bubble study later today.



Medications	  

PROPRANOLOL (PROPRANOLOL HCL)	 40MG PO BID x 87 days Start Date: 10/1/32 Stop Date: 12/27/32

ATENOLOL	 50MG 1 Tablet(s) PO QD Start Date: 12/31/32

NORVASC (AMLODIPINE)	 2.5MG 1 Tablet(s) PO QD Start Date: 12/31/32



Exam	

Alert, Ox3. Speech fluent, non-dysarthric. 

EOM's full, no nystagmus. 

Face symmetric, full power x 4. No drift. 

Gait steady, narrow-based. 



Plan	

I am pleased with his negative results so far (24 hour holter, CNIS), and I doubt the TTE will change our management. We are likely left with small vessel disease causing a lacune in the internal capsule. The best for of treatment would be continued antiplatelet therapy with the ASA 325mg per day, and continued treatment for his hypertension, as per Dr. Tolliver. I will see him again in 3 months time, and he will call me in the interim with any problems or questions.

ATTENDING CONSULTATION NOTE 
 
DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent renal cell carcinoma.  
 
HISTORY: Mr. Slater is a delightful and active 80-year-old man who was incidentally found to have a renal mass in 2133. At that time Dr. Updike performed a left partial nephrectomy, and the final pathology showed a 1.5 cm clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Since that date he has remained well with no clinical evidence of recurrent disease and has had interval CT scans. For the last 2 years, enhancing nodules have been noted within the region of the partial nephrectomy. A biopsy performed approximately 1 year ago did not demonstrate any cancer within modestly enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes. CT scan was repeated in December of 2137. This again showed some enlarged retroperitoneal adenopathy and also enlargement of the soft tissue nodules. Biopsy in March of this year showed probable recurrent renal cell carcinoma of the clear cell type within the nodules. Biopsy of an adjacent adrenal gland showed no cancer. His metastatic workup has included CT scans of the chest, which have demonstrated small pulmonary nodules of uncertain significance.  
 
He has met with Drs. Eagle and Yzaguirre. Both have recommended completion of the nephrectomy and resection of any visible tumor, perhaps with intraoperative radiation as well. 
  
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  
 
1. Hypertension.  
 
2. CVA with residual weakness on the right side. He is, however, still able to walk with a cane.  
 
3. High cholesterol.  
 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, Norvasc, Avapro, clonidine, Lipitor, and allopurinol.   

DRUG ALLERGIES: None known.  
 
SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a long retired news writer with a heavy smoking history. He last smoked in 2132. He is a widow and came today to the appointment with 1 of his daughters.  
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No respiratory symptoms suggesting progressive pulmonary metastases, no abdominal or GI symptoms.  
 

PHYSICAL EXAM:
No anemia, jaundice, cyanosis, or clubbing
No gynecomastia
Respiration comfortable
Mild right-sided motor weakness, walks with a cane. 
No skeletal deformity or tenderness
Head, eyes, ears, and nose normal 
Abdomen soft with no hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, nor any additional masses.
No hernias.
 
 
RADIOLOGY: CT scans demonstrate multiple soft tissue nodules within the partial nephrectomy bed, the largest being 15 mm across. He also has prominent lymph nodes within the retroperitoneum, the largest of which is 14 mm, and an enlarged left common iliac lymph node of 18 mm. Chest CT shows scattered 2 mm nodules of uncertain significance.  
 
IMPRESSION AND PLAN: Confirmed local recurrence of renal cell cancer - for completion nephrectomy and resection of tumor bed.  Lymph nodes will be also be sampled.  
 
For intraoperative radiation if appropriate and possibly adjuvant radiation to follow.  Consent obtained today.

CHIEF COMPLAINT
: 
hyperglycemia






HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS





            Mr. Slater is an 83 yo w/ h/o bullous pemphigoid, chronic kidney disease, HTN, dyslipidemia, and multiple vasculopathies presenting with hyperglycemia.  His dermatologist started prednisone (60 mg daily) three weeks ago for a pemphigiod flair.  Mr Slater&#8217;s sugars were initially well controlled off insulin, but a week and a half ago he began to develop lower extremity edema, DOE, and general fatigue.  He began to taper the prednisone (to 40 mg daily) and then stopped them altogether yesterday.  He presented to the FPC ED complaining of fatigue and weakness and was found to have a FSBG&gt;500.  His initial labs were notable for a glucose of 804.  An EKG showed a-fib (rate 70s).  His blood pressure, oxygenation, and respiratory were the normal range and he was given 2 L of NS and regular insulin.  Repeat labs showed Glu 479 w/ partial resolution of other electrolyte abnormalities.  He was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management.

A/P
: Mr. Slater is an 83 yo w/ h/o bullous pemphigoid, chronic kidney disease, HTN, dyslipidemia, and multiple vasculopathies presenting with hyperglycemia


#) Hyperglycemia:
 Elevated glucose, serum osm, lack of anion gap, and absence of urine ketones suggest HHS. Most likely etiology is steroid-induced hyperglycemia superimposed on ? underlying DM (HgbA1c 6.80 in the past).  No e/o infectious-trigger (urine culture negative and CXR equivocal).  Rapidly improving after IVF in ED and insulin.  Current FSBG 330.  Diagnostic evaluation: will send repeat HgbA1c, FSBG before meals, qd electrolytes.  Therapeutic intervention: will hold IVF given new a-fib and signs of volume overload (see below); give 10 U regular insulin now and SSI with meals (convert daily usage to NPH); potassium repletion PRN




#) A-fib:
 New onset a-fib.  Differential includes fluid overload, hyperthyroidism, pre-existing structural heart disease (LAH, mitral regurg/stenosis).  CHADS2 score: 12.5% risk of stroke over the next year if not on anticoagulation.  Currently rate-controlled 80s.  Diagnostic evaluation: echocardiogram, TSH, cardiac monitor.  Therapeutic intervention: d/c amlodipine (given LE edema) and start low dose dilt (30 mg TID) for continued rate control.  On ASA.  Will discuss risks/benefits of coumadin w/ patient and PCP.



#) Troponin leak: In the absence of chest pain/angina or concerning EKG changes, this likely represents heart strain in the context of chronic kidney disease. 
Will trend enzyme, repeat EKG, and monitor for changes in clinical status.




#) Edema
: differential includes congestive heart failure vs worsening kidney disease vs iatrogenic volume overload vs capillary leak syndrome (from steroids, norvasc). 
Given duration, clinical picture, and elevated BNP (although no baseline comparison), concerning for CHF.  Diagnostic evaluation: echocardiogram, TSH, etc. w/ more extensive evaluation as needed.  Therapeutic intervention: will hold lasix given underlying kidney function, continue HCTZ, monitor I/Os.




#) Bullous pemphigoid
: Will restart prednisone taper at 40 mg daily per dermatology outpatient note w/ goal of one additional week, then 20 mg daily for three weeks. 
Will contact dermatology regarding modifications to the regimen, if any.




#) HTN
: Currently well-controlled.  Continue doxazosin 2 mg qHS, HCTZ 12.5 PO daily

Aliskiren/HCTZ 12.5 mg daily, and clonidine 0.2 mg PO BID.  Monitor and add additional agents as needed




#) Chronic kidney disease: Cr slightly above baseline, but improving with hydration.  Will monitor.  No current indications for renal replacement therapy.



#) 
? PNA:  Afebrile and asymptomatic (no cough, chest pain, tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis, or left shift).  Will hold antibiotics.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient was examined and 
treated in conjunction with a resident.  Briefly, the history is as 
follows:  The patient is a 47 year old male with end stage renal 
disease on hemodialysis who was referred for abdominal discomfort 
and fever.  His abdominal discomfort had begun within the preceding 
24 hours and had gradually worsened.  He had pain in the left lower 
quadrant radiating to the rectal area.  He did have one diarrheal 
bowel movement.  He specifically denied bleeding. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL APPEARANCE:  The patient was awake 
and alert, although somewhat sluggish and apparently uncomfortable. 
VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure was 177/90, pulse 117, initial 
temperature 103.3, respiratory rate 20.  HEENT:  Pupils were equal. 
Sclerae were anicteric.  The oropharynx showed normal architecture. 
NECK:  Supple.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  LUNGS: 
The breath sounds were essentially clear.  ABDOMEN:  There was mild 
to moderate diffuse tenderness.  No definite mass can be 
appreciated.  Bowel sounds were diminished.  RECTAL:  Stool is 
guaiac-negative, per the resident's examination.  EXTREMITIES: 
Examination of the left thigh showed slight drainage at a recent 
surgical incision site. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Electrolytes showed sodium 139, potassium 
4.3, chloride 99, CO2 27, BUN 12, creatinine 2.2, glucose 230. 
White blood cell count was 30,000, hematocrit 38.  Chest x-ray 
showed no definite infiltrate.  Abdominal x-ray showed dilated 
loops of small bowel.  EKG showed no change from previous tracings. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The assessment and plan were 
reviewed with the resident. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  I confirm the provisional diagnosis of abdominal 
pain with question of deep venous thrombosis versus sepsis from as 
yet unidentified source. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The care plan 
was reviewed.  The patient was started on antibiotics and 
ultimately admitted to the hospital for definitive evaluation and 
further care.

RE:  Branche, Earnest
MRN: 53023691
 
Dear Dr. Xayarath:
 
Your patient Mr. Earnest
Branche returned to the
office today for a follow
up visit.  As you know,
Mr. Branche underwent a
left femoral to posterior
tibial bypass one month
ago followed by
amputation of a
gangrenous first toe.
After being discharged
from our service he was
readmitted to the Medical
Service with a severe
case of C. difficile
colitis.  Ultimately this
resolved and he was
discharged.  Today he
reports that the diarrhea
has again resumed and he
was placed back on an
oral antibiotic
yesterday.  He complains
of only mild incisional
discomfort in his left
leg.
 
On examination, there is
a strong pulse easily
palpated over the left
lower extremity bypass
graft.  The old right
lower extremity bypass
graft was also palpable.
The left foot itself is
warm.  The great toe
incision site, however,
has developed necrotic
tissue all along the
incision, which was
sharply debrided to clean
margins.  This will now
need to be treated as an
open wound.  The calf
portion of the left lower
extremity incision also
has a narrow zone of
superficial skin slough
which was gently
debrided.  The graft is
not exposed and there are
no deep wounds in the
leg.
 
Mr. Branche's left lower
extremity bypass graft is
functioning well.
However, he will require
significant ongoing wound
care for the immediate
future.  Daily dressing
changes will be arranged
with visiting nurse
services.  We plan to
follow him closely and an
appointment was given for
two weeks.
 
Thanks again for allowing
us to participate in the
care of this delightful
and challenging patient
and please don't hesitate
to contact me at any time
if I can

The patient was seen by me in the emergency department with Dr. 
Whittaker.  The resident's note was reviewed and the patient was 
interviewed and examined by me. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The patient is a very pleasant, 
50 year-old gentleman who presents with gross hematemesis and 
coffee-ground emesis.  He had it during the night and then this 
morning developed coffee-grounds turned to red blood emesis.  He 
denies any light-headedness, chest pain or abdominal pain.  He has 
had some diarrhea over the last seven months, of unclear etiology. 
No melena. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Chronic renal failure, myocardial 
infarction, insulin dependent diabetes. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  The patient was hemodynamically 
stable, well-appearing, nontoxic.  LUNGS:  Clear.  HEART:  Regular 
rate and rhythm.  ABDOMEN:  Soft with tenderness to palpation in 
the bilateral lower quadrants.  NG tube lavage showed 200 cc of 
pink tinged fluid, cleared after 50 cc. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Hematocrit was 46, white count 11, 
potassium 6.6, moderately hemolyzed.  BUN was 62, creatinine 6.9. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient will be seen by the 
renal service and admitted to the medical service.  The patient 
will need dialysis and endoscopy tomorrow.  See resident's note for 
details. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Upper GI bleed. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 
admitted in satisfactory condition.

RE:Branch, Earnest
MRN:53023691
 
Dear Dr. Xayarath:
 
Your patient Earnest Branch came in the office today for a follow up 
visit.  Mr. Branch is now two years out from a right femoral-
tibial bypass and nine months out from a left femoral-tibial 
bypass with subsequent transmetatarsal amputation of the left foot 
and split-thickness skin grafting.  Over the last several months, 
he has been undergoing dressing changes to remaining, small, 
superficial, open wounds on the dorsum of the left foot.  Over the 
last one to two weeks, he began to note the development of a new 
area of dark skin on the lateral aspect of the left foot and 
recently has noted some drainage.  He denies any fevers.  In 
addition and of note, he complains of recent onset of pain in the 
right eye and has an appointment at the Ophthalmology Clinic 
immediately following his visit with us.  He last underwent 
vascular lab studies in September at which time both lower 
extremity bypass grafts were widely patent and without stenoses.
 
On examination today, there are strong, easily palpable pulses 
over both lower extremity bypass grafts.  The right foot is warm 
and without any new ischemic skin changes or lesions.  On 
examination of the left foot, there is a large area of full-
thickness skin necrosis on the lateral aspect of the foot where 
there had never been any previous open wounds.  This area 
encompasses a significant proportion of the lateral aspect of the 
foot from the end of the transmetatarsal incision to the proximal 
mid foot.  On probing, purulent material drains from the margins 
and there is obvious significant sepsis.  The foot itself is warm 
and there is a good posterior tibial Doppler signal at the ankle.
 
Unfortunately, Mr. Branch has developed a new, large wound on the 
left foot which likely began as a pressure (decubitus) ulceration 
due to his severe neuropathy.  This is now complicated by 
significant local sepsis and there is a large area of soft tissue 
loss on the foot.  He will require urgent admission and operative 
debridement today.  In addition, given the extent of the problem, 
it is likely that he will ultimately come to below-knee amputation 
in the end.  Immediately following his visit to the Ophthalmology 
Clinic, he will be admitted to the

hospital with the hopes of performing debridement and drainage 
later today.  I will certainly continue to keep you apprised of 
his progress.
 
Sincerely,

BRANCH,EARNEST   530-23-69-1                      VISIT DATE: 12/31/82

This patient was seen primarily by Dr. Xavier Whittaker.  I also saw 

the patient, reviewed the resident's note, and discussed evaluation 

and plan. 

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and nausea.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 49-year-old man has been 

complaining of shortness of breath for the last 24 hours.  He came 

in complaining of that plus some nausea and was found to have a 

highly elevated glucose and was sent over here.  The patient denies 

any chest pain or pain any place else, but he does state that he 

feels poorly.  Of note, on transport and on arrival here, his blood 

sugar was noted to be greater than 600.  The patient does not 

complain of blurry vision and does not complain of 

light-headedness, just the nausea and the shortness of breath. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per the resident's note. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Cardiomyopathy.  Otherwise, as per the 

resident's note. 

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As per the resident's note. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Significant findings include a pulse of 76, 

respirations 22.  The patient appears to be in no acute distress.  

The lungs display crackles bilaterally to the mid lung.  There is 

jugular venous distention elevation to the angle of the jaw.  

Cardiac examination is otherwise normal.  Abdominal examination is 

within normal limits.  The patient has a colostomy.  The patient 

has a left below-knee amputation and toe-digit-toe amputation on 

the right side.  Otherwise, there are no musculoskeletal 

abnormalities.  There are some decubitus ulcers which are stable.

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Laboratories are significant for a glucose 

of 934, sodium 127, anion gap 17, bicarb 19, creatinine and BUN 5.8 

and 37, hematocrit 30, which is not too different from his usual.  

His pH is 7.42.  CK is 54, but troponin is 1.45.  Of note, however, 

the patient does have renal conditions.  EKG shows new deep Qs in 

2, 3, and F compared to one done a month ago.  Chest x-ray shows 

some excess interstitial markings indicative of increased fluid.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  This patient appears to have 

congestive heart failure.  He may be having new cardiac event, 

although after a consultation with the Integra Health

cardiologist, he felt that perhaps this might not be a new event, 

but rather due to axis deviation.  The patient is being treated for 

his hyperglycemia and is being admitted.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:

1.  Rule out myocardial infarction.

2.  Hyperglycemia.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 

admitted to the hospital in stable condition.

Re:  Umstead, Kenneth
     MR #401-10-87-8
 
Dear Jac:
 
I saw your patient, Kenneth Umstead, in the Cardiology office today
and he seems to be doing very well from a cardiovascular
perspective.  Apparently he has had guaiac positive stools and has
undergone a colonoscopy with the identification of four polyps. 
Three have been removed and he then had a GI bleed.  This has been
reevaluated and he has been stable.  The fourth polyp will need to
be removed at a later time.  At this point, his aspirin has been
discontinued for a number of days and the Lopid was also
discontinued apparently because of increased liver function tests. 
His current medications therefore include Lasix 40 mg per day,
Metoprolol 25 mg qd, Nifedipine XL 30 mg qd.  He is aware of a
belching and burping sensation after eating but otherwise no
exertional or other related symptoms.  He is reasonably active but
somewhat limited by his claudication.
 
On exam today, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 130/70,
a heart rate of 65 and regular.  Head and neck were unremarkable. 
Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam showed no jugular venous distension
at 30 degrees.  PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 are normal with a
physiologic split.  There is an S4 and a I/VI systolic ejection
murmur at the left sternal border.  Abdominal exam was
unremarkable.  Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis.  
 
His resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus
rhythm with left axis deviation and a nonspecific left
intraventricular conduction delay.

I think Mr. Umstead is basically doing quite well.  It would be of
value to repeat an exercise test since he has not had one since
2069.  He had minimal ischemia at that time.  There are no symptoms
that would prompt cardiac catheterization at this point and we will
see how he does on the exercise test with the objective findings. 
 
 
If any problems develop, please don't hesitate to contact me. 
Thank you very much for allowing me to help with his care.
 
Kindest personal regards.
 
Sincerely yours,

RE:  Kenneth Umstead
     MR #401-10-87-8
 
Dear Jac:
 
I saw your patient, Kenneth Umstead, in the Cardiology Office today
and he seems like he is improved. He feels his legs are better and
that he can walk greater distances. He feels very comfortable. 
 
His current medications include Metoprolol 50 mg per day,
Nifedipine XL 60 mg per day, Lasix 20 mg per day. 
 
On exam today, he has a blood pressure of 146/76, a heart rate of
65 and regular. Weight 210 pounds. Head and neck unremarkable.
Chest is clear. Cardiac exam is notable for an S4 and a I/VI
systolic ejection murmur. The rest of his exam was unremarkable.
 
Resting 12 lead electrocardiogram is unchanged demonstrating normal
sinus rhythm and a left axis deviation. There is a nonspecific
intraventricular conduction delay. 
 
I think Mr. Umstead is doing very well. He would like to have his
arterial pulses rechecked noninvasively and I tried to arrange that
schedule. In addition, his Metoprolol has been only once a day and
if he can tolerate it twice a day he will have a better control and
more prolonged risk prevention. I suggest that we increase it to 50
mg bid. I also told him how to take his pulse and he can keep an
eye on it. If it drops too low we can reduce the dose. He asked
that I see him again in about six months for routine re-evaluation
and I will be happy to do so. If any problems develop in the
interim please do not hesitate to contact me. 
 
Thank you for allowing me to help with his care. 
 
Kindest regards.

Re:  Kenneth Umstead
     MR#  401-10-87-8
 
Dear Jac:
 
I saw your patient Kenneth Umstead in the Cardiology Office today and
he feels he has actually improved.  His primary limitation had been
his claudication, but he feels that he can walk better now than in
the past.  We had a repeat evaluation of his segmental leg pressure
and volumes, and these actually were unchanged from a prior study
two years ago.  The post volume recordings were normal in each leg. 
Systolic pressure gradients were present in the right leg
consistent with mild anterior tibial/dorsalis pedis disease.  No
systolic pressure gradients were found in the left leg.  These were
unchanged from January, 2072.  Mr. Umstead feels that he can be more
physically active and is less limited.
 
His current medical regimen includes Metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d.,
Nifedipine XL 60 mg q.d., and Lasix 20 mg q.d.
 
Of note, in October, 2073, he was found by colonoscopy to have four
polyps which were removed.  Apparently, no malignant cells were
seen in the pathologic specimens.
 
On exam, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 122/68, heart
rate 63 and regular, weight 205 lbs.  HEENT unremarkable.  Chest
was clear.  Cardiac exam showed no jugular venous distention at 30
degrees, PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 normal but physiologically
split.  There was an S4 and a I/VI systolic ejection murmur at the
lower left sternal border.  Abdominal exam was unremarkable. 
Extremities show no edema or cyanosis.
 
His resting 12 lead EKG demonstrates normal sinus rhythm, left axis
deviation, and persisting X waves across the precordium consistent
with his left anterior hemiblock.
 
I think Mr. Umstead is doing quite well.  He asked that I see him
again in six months for routine re-evaluation, and I would be happy
to do so. If any problems develop in the interim please don't
hesitate to contact me.  Thank you for allowing me to participate
in his care.

Internal Medicine Intern Admission Note

PATIENT:  Umstead, Kenneth
MRN:  9544546
ADMIT DATE: 7/02/84 
ATTENDING: Vernon Toth
PCP:  Vernon Toth
CONTACT:  Valeria Umstead (056) 216-7457

CC:  lethargy, increasing disorientation x2 weeks

HPI:  
Mr Umstead is an 87yo M with h/o Alzheimer   s vs vascular dementia, vasculopathy (s/p CEA, known PVD) who presents after two weeks of increased lethargy, increasing disorientation and visual hallucinations.

Per his wife who acts as his primary caretaker, Mr Umstead was in his USOH until about two weeks ago, when she began noticing increased lethargy and confusion.  He developed gait instability and began confusing family members with each other, and being confused about whether the house he was in was his own.  This increased in severity over the past 3-4 days.  He complains of some weakness in his left leg but otherwise has had no other focal motor or sensory deficits. He has had no recent fevers, chills, SOB, sudden motor or sensory loss.   No new incontinence.

This history was limited by patient   s inability to cooperate.

ED COURSE:  Tox screen and metabolic workup in ED were both negative. CXR and U/A performed showing no infectious processes.  Head CT was performed showing no change from prior, though there was a small increase in the size of the lateral ventricles possibly suggestive of normal pressure hydrocephalus.  LP was negative.  Pt was admitted to Internal Medicine for further workup of recent change in mental status and neuro/psych consult.

RADIOLOGY
MRI Brain (7/02/84)
No acute infarction.
Chronic right basal ganglia and bilateral cerebellar infarctions, stable from prior.
Mild progression of periventricular and deep white matter T2  hyperintensity which is nonspecific, likely relating to progression of small vessel ischemic disease.
Interval enlargement of ventricles and sulci consistent with progression of cortical volume loss.

CXR (7/02/84):  WNL

CT Brain (7/02/84)
No evidence of an acute intracranial process.
Mildly increased prominence of the lateral ventricles with increased periventricular hypoattenuation.  Although this likely represents microangiopathic changes with commensurate ventricular prominence, consider normal pressure hydrocephalus in the correct clinical setting.

EKG:  Sinus rhythm, 1st degree AV block with atrial bigemeny. Left axis deviation and LVH by R in aVL >11.

ASSESSMENT & PLAN
87yo M with h/o Alzheimer   s vs vascular dementia, vasculopathic (carotid stenosis s/p CEA, PVD) who presents with two weeks of increasing lethargy, disorientation, gait instability and visual hallucinations.  The etiology of this downturn remains unclear.  Given his normal temperature, normal CXR and normal U/A, an infectious etiology is unlikely.  Concern for a stroke-related etiology, either embolic or lacunar, is unlikely given CT and MRI results.  However, microembolic disease may be a possibility.  Given the relatively rapid onset of symptoms, worsening Alzheimer   s dementia is less likely, though often onset of Alzheimer   s may appear to have a rapid onset simply because a threshold of recognition by family members has been reached while the process itself was in fact more protracted.  As suggested in the CT results, normal pressure hydrocephalus may be a possibility, though the lack of incontinence makes this less likely. LP performed in the ED was diagnostic and not therapeutic for NPH.  One further diagnosis to consider would be an encephalopathic process, perhaps due to hypertension.

A more psychiatric etiology should also be considered in this patient.  Depression can often manifest itself with lethargy and disorientation, especially in the elderly. However, it is difficult to adequately assess this in the absence of a caretaker, as Mr Umstead is currently difficult to direct with questioning.

Dementia:  CXR, U/A negative. CT/MRI negative for acute embolic events.  Most likely etiologies are worsening vascular vs Alzheimer   s dementia.
will d/w attending
consider psychiatric consult
Continue Namenda for presumed Alzheimer   s
Will consult neuro for management of Alzheimer   s and further workup of possible NPH

H/o cerebellar stroke: Currently on Aggrenox (not on Coumadin due to fall risk), will continue.

NIDDM: Will start RISS

Hyperlipidemia: Continue Lipitor 20mg PO QD

HTN: metoprolol

Prophylaxis: already on Aggrenox for embolic ppx.

Code Status: Will need to discuss with wife tomorrow.

Kenneth X. Sylvester, Jr., M.D.
Holden District Hospital

Foxborough, TX  58771


Dear Ken:

Mr. Ocampo returns to the office following his recent coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  As you know, Dr. Todd Banks took him to the operating room on August 17th, at which point, he underwent multivessel bypass surgery with placement of a left internal mammary artery to his LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to his PDA, first obtuse marginal, and second obtuse marginal.  He tolerated the procedure uneventfully.  His postoperative course was notable for intermittent atrial fibrillation for which he was eventually started on amiodarone therapy.  He also had some difficulty with urinary retention and had a Foley placed, which has stayed in since discharge.  He spent approximately 10 days in Gadsden Medical and has now been discharged to home.  Currently, he complains of a variety of musculoskeletal complaints involving his upper chest and left arm; however, he denies symptoms of active angina, congestive failure, or sensed arrhythmias.  He is slowly recovering his overall strength.

The last blood studies available to me indicate a random glucose of 118, creatinine of 1.1, normal liver function studies, cholesterol of 124, triglyceride of 124, HDL 39, LDL 60, hematocrit of 33.3.

On a regimen of amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d., enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., Niferex 150 mg p.o. q.d., p.r.n. Tylenol No. 3, Hytrin 10 mg p.o. q.d., Proscar 5 mg p.o. q.d., Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o. q.d., Pletal 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., possibly simvastatin at 20 mg p.o. q.d.

Physical exam today reveals a pleasant male in no acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 110/50, heart rate 65 and regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight 183 pounds.  The neck is supple, JVP flat, carotids are 2+ without significant bruits.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with 1/6 systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base, no significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is benign.  Extremities reveal markedly diminished peripheral pulses and 1+ pedal edema.

Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 60, PR interval 0.14, QRS 0.12, QT 0.38, axis -20 degrees.  There is evidence of left bundle-branch block with secondary ST and T-wave changes.  An echocardiogram performed prior to discharge revealed mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function with a global ejection fraction of 40% at a time when he had a very rapid heart rate.  No subsequent echocardiogram has been performed when he is in sinus rhythm.

Impression and Plan:  Mr. Ocampo is making a slow but study recovery from his multivessel coronary bypass graft surgery.  I suggested he undergo repeat echocardiogram to document current left ventricular function now that he is back in sinus rhythm.  I told him he would stay on amiodarone for approximately 3-6 months, and assuming, he was in normal sinus rhythm throughout this time period, his amiodarone would then be discontinued.  At that time, I would also discontinue his Coumadin.  In addition, at the time of his diagnostic catheterization, he had evidence for severe peripheral vascular disease, and he understands that when he has completed his recovery from his recent surgery, I would strongly encourage further evaluation of his lower extremity arterial system with an eye toward potential percutaneous intervention.  In addition, I have asked him to obtain copies of his discharge summary from the Gadsden Medical Center.  I would like to resume ACE inhibitor therapy in light of his significant CAD and probable left ventricular dysfunction.  He will have routine blood studies obtained today.  I would target his LDL cholesterol to the 70 range.  Beyond this, I have not altered his current regimen.

Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in his care.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Wil,



INTERVAL HISTORY:

Mrs. Ulibarri returned today for follow-up of coronary artery disease, post recent CABG.  As you know, her course was complicated by heparin induced thrombocytopenia, and she has been continued on Coumadin anticoagulation.  She has done relatively well in five weeks since surgery and her energy level has improved.  The major ongoing symptoms is aching in the upper part of the sternum, and an opening in the lower part of the incision which drains some purulent material.  She also has a suture and her leg which has worked its way to the surface and causes some discomfort.  Her breathing is much better than preoperatively, and she has had no chest pain.  She has very mild residual dyspnea.  She has had mild edema at times, but it has largely resolved.  She has had no fever.



Review of Systems:                                                                                                  .

All of the following are normal or negative.  GENERAL:  night sweats, fever and chills.  HEAD AND NECK: headaches, hoarseness.  RESPIRATORY: cough, coughing up blood.  CARDIOVASCULAR: see history above.  GASTROINTESTINAL: frequent heartburn or indigestion, difficulty swallowing, black or tarry stools, nausea/vomiting.  URINARY: frequent urination at night, urinary tract infections, blood in urine.  NEUROLOGIC: transient paralysis, seizures, visual loss in one eye.  HEMATOLOGIC: easy bruising.  SKIN: new rashes or eruptions, poor healing of foot sores, moles that are changing size.  ENDOCRINE: elevated blood sugars, thyroid problems.  MUSCULOSKELETAL: low back pain, joint pains, joint swelling.



Family and Social History:

Family and social history have not changed.  There is no pertinent new information which has bearing on the current problems.



Physical Examination: .

She looks quite well.  Her blood pressure is 160/80.  Central venous pressure is normal and lungs are clear.  There is mild tenderness with no redness or swelling over the upper end of the sternum, and there is a 1 cm in diameter opening of the incision at the lower end, with sero-purulent drainage.  Lungs are clear.  Heart shows regular rhythm and I hear no rub or murmur.  Liver is not palpable and there is no edema.  There was a small end of a suture from the small leg incision, which I clipped off.



Electrocardiogram: .

Normal sinus rhythm.  Anterior T-wave inversion, somewhat to tracing.  Before the operation.



Overall, Mrs. Ulibarri is improved.  I asked him concerns about possible smoldering infection of her sternum.  I will send her to Trevino made to for the surgical team to violate this, and will then a CT scan of her chest and sternum looking for any collection of pus.



I have encouraged her to continue to be active.  Her walking is limited by pain, which limits or exercise.  She has already returned to her part-time work.



I made no change in her regimen today.  Our plan to see her again a couple of months and she will continue on Coumadin anticoagulation.  I'll keep you posted.



							Sincerely yours,







							William C. Sargent, M.D.

Referring Physician:  Dr. Kenyon, Dr. Elmer Ure, Vallejo General 
Cardiology.  
 
Referring Diagnosis: Status post cardiac transplant. Rule out 
osteoporosis.  
 
HPI:  Patient is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of lymphoma, 
diagnosed in 2070 when he presented with left axillary enlargement.  At 
the time, he was staged by bone marrow transplant which was negative.  
Whether this was a Hodgkin's or non-Hodgki's lymphoma is unclear to us, 
but he was treated with bleomycin, adriamycin and prednisone for 
approximately 26 weeks.  At that point, he was believed to be in 
remission and stayed in remission since then.  
 
In 2077, the patient was first diagnosed with diabetes mellitus when he 
presented with polyuria, polydipsia and blurred vision.  Subsequently he 
was treated with oral hypoglycemic agents for one to two years and since 
that time has been on insulin therapy, currently on 64 units of NPH and 
six of regular in the morning with 30 NPH and six of regular pre-supper.  
He currently checks his blood sugars four times a day and runs in the 
100-200 range with average being about 130 and is followed by Dr. Nicodemus 
Paz of Queenstown, WI, his primary care doctor, for this.  The patient's 
complications of diabetes mellitus are possibly non-existent.  There is 
no peripheral neuropathy.  There is no autonomic neuropathy.  No retinal 
disease.  However, the patient does have renal disease, with baseline 
creatinine currently of 2.4.  
 
Recently the patient developed congestive heart failure with initial 
symptoms in the early 80s.  By June of 2082, the patient had fairly 
severe symptoms requiring hospitalizations and in the period of July 
2082 to June of 2083, the patient apparently had 5 myocardial 
infarctions.  In June 2083, the patient underwent orthotopic cardiac 
transplant here at the VGH under the care of Dr. Quentin Fitzpatrick.  Since 
that time, the patient has done very well without evidence of rejection 
with relatively good exercise tolerance and with basically a minimum 
degree of symptoms.  
 
The patient's current medications include cyclosporine 150 mg. twice a 
day; prednisone 8 mg. a day.  Azathioprine 250 mg. a day; Axid 150 mg. 
twice a day; Cardizem 300 mg. a day; baby aspirin once a day; Cardura 4 
mg. once a day; and amitriptyline 25 mg. a day for cramping in his legs.  
 
Review of Systems:  Has had one fracture of his right ring finger that 
was from a trauma some years ago.  Other past medical history includes 
history of sleep apnea and depression and the things mentioned.

Family History:  His sister, aged 54, and mother, have osteoporosis with 
his mother having fairly severe osteoporosis with a normal of vertebral 
collapses and some nerve damage.  His father and mother have had 
diabetes mellitus, his father dying of heart disease.  There is a 
19-year-old daughter who has a history of migraines.  There is no 
history of thyroid disease in the family.
 
Social History:  He currently works at Belkin and has a desk job 
there.  He quit smoking and drinking 15-20 years ago.  He has been 
married for over 20 years.  His review of symptoms revealed the absence 
of GI symptoms.  There were no orthostatic symptoms, no angina.  Normal 
sexual function.  He denied any skin problems or rashes.  He denied 
numbness and tingling in his feet, etc.  There is a history of 
hypertension.  
 
Other review of systems:  His height has been stable at 6'2"" tall.  
 
Physical Examination:  Blood pressure 130/93.  Heart rate 96.   The 
patient is a well-appearing gentleman, somewhat obese.  His height is 
6'2"".  Weight 294 lbs. which is apparently steadily been increasing.  He 
has a mild Cushingoid appearance with a little bit of posterior cervical 
and supraclavicular fat.  Retina appeared without lesions.  Normal 
extra-ocular movements.  His oral mucosa was moist without evidence of 
thrush.  Neck exam:  He had a supple neck with no carotid bruits.  
Normal thyroid.   His chest exam revealed clear lung fields with normal 
excretion.  There was no bony tenderness or abnormalities on his back.  
His cardiac exam:  He had a soft, S1, S2.  Cardiac exam otherwise 
unremarkable.  His abdomen was soft.  He had some evidence of insulin 
injections, but no significant hypertrophy.  He injects both in his 
abdomen and rotates with his arms.  His extremities revealed minimal 
stasis dermatitis, normal pulses, and were symmetric.  No edema.  
Neurologically he was diffusely hyporeflexic.  He had normal to slightly 
decreased vibratory sensation in his big toes.  
 
Laboratory Exam:  Most recent laboratories that I could find were 
February 09, 2084.  Sodium 141.  K 5.1; chloride 105.  Bicarb 20.  BUN 
39.  Creatinine 3.4; glucose 136.  His CK was 219.  Calcium 9.7.  
Albumin 4.3; phosphate 4.0.  Alkaline phosphatase was 90.  Uric acid 
5.1; magnesium 1.9.  TSH was 1.6.  Cholesterol 242.  Triglycerides 226.  
His cyclosporine level was in the therapeutic range at 273.  His CBC 
revealed a hematocrit of 43 and a white count of 8.9 thousand with a 
normal differential.  
 
Assessment and Plan:  This is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of 
multiple medical problems.  The one's most pertinent to us currently are

the fact that he is post-transplant, has several risk factors for 
osteoporosis, including prednisone use and a family history of 
osteoporosis.  The total amount of exposure to prednisone sounds like it 
is about a year-and-a-half or so with half a year during his 
chemotherapy 14 years ago and then about a year since his transplant.  
The patient's history of never having had fractures, no bone pain, no 
height loss and his body habitus are consistent with someone who might 
be somewhat more resistant to osteoporosis than many transplant 
patients.  However, getting a bone density study in the patient like 
this makes sense.  We will therefore schedule a spinal bone density on 
his follow up visit, since he cannot have one today for scheduling 
reasons.  We will also check vitamin D levels given patient's history of 
renal failure and the fact that the one thing that we might be able to 
do for him is to give him vitamin D.  His calcium intake was estimated 
to be about 1,000 mg. a day including one cup of milk, green leafy 
vegetables and one cup of ice cream each day.  We would be a little 
reticent about starting higher doses of calcium given his renal failure, 
without more information about this patient.  The patient's diabetes 
seems to be in pretty good repair at the moment with blood sugars under 
fairly good control, sounding like they are in the 130 range although we 
don't have access to hemoglobin A1C.  Given the fact that it sounds like 
he has got pretty good care by Dr. Paz, we will not pursue this at 
the current time unless asked, and we will focus primarily on the bone 
situation.  Otherwise, we will see the patient back or at least talk to

RE:  Edwin Workman
     MR #612-48-04-0
 
Dear Dr. Paz:
 
I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Workman in follow-up today. 
Overall, he is doing very well from a cardiovascular perspective. 
Unfortunately, he continues to gain weight but overall he is doing
well. 
 
His current medical regimen includes cyclosporin 150 b.i.d.,
prednisone 6 mg q.d., Imuran 275 q.d., Cardizem CD 300 mg q.d.,
Cardura 4 mg q.d., one baby aspirin a day, Axid 150 b.i.d.,
pravachol 20 q.d., magnesium oxide 250 mg b.i.d., calcium and
vitamin D, insulin NPH 54 units and 10 Regular in the morning, 32
units of NPH and 8 of Regular in the evening.  
 
On physical examination, he was obese.  Blood pressure of 150/90
with a heart rate of 85, weight was 305 pounds which is increased
5 pounds from September 21st.  Chest was clear to auscultation and
percussion.  Cardiac exam reveals a flat JVP at 30 degrees, a non-
displaced PMI with a normal S1, S2 without murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.  His abdomen
is obese, soft and nontender.  It is difficult to appreciate any
organomegaly.  There is no hepatojugular reflux.  Extremities are
without edema. 
 
Electrocardiogram reveals normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 85. 
Intervals of .16/.08/.34 with an axis of 60 degrees.  This is a
normal tracing unchanged from previous tracing.
 
Therefore, Mr. Workman is doing well from a cardiovascular
perspective.  We will make the necessary adjustments in his medical
regimen according to his laboratory results.  Unfortunately, he did
take his cyclosporin this morning and therefore he will mail his
labs back to us.
 
I did discuss with him attempting some weight loss with portion
control.  I think it might work to give him some reasonable goals
such as a weight loss of 30 pounds as apposed to 130.
 
Workman, Edwin
MR #612-48-04-0                    -2-            October 17, 2085

Best regards.

Dear Dr. Paz:
 
I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Workman in follow-up today. 
Overall he is relatively stable from a cardiac standpoint.  Most
importantly, recently he was laid off from his job at Belkin.  He
has been quite depressed about this.  
 
His medical regimen includes Cyclosporin 150 b.i.d., prednisone 6
q.d., Imuran 275 q.d., Cardizem CD 300 q.d., Cardura 4 mg. q.d.,
Pravachol 40 mg. q.d., Axid 150 b.i.d., Calcium, vitamin C and D,
Mag. Oxide 250 q.d., Paxil 300 q.d., NPH Insulin.
 
On physical examination he was well appearing in no distress.  He
had a blood pressure of 136/80 with a heart rate of 90, weight was
309 pounds which has increased eight pounds from July.  Chest was
clear to auscultation.  Cardiac exam revealed a flat JVP at 30
degrees, non-displaced PMI with a normal S1 and S2 without murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  Carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.
Abdomen was soft, nontender. There is no organomegaly, no
hepatojugular reflux. Extremities without edema.
 
Electrocardiogram reveals normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 90. 
Intervals of .16/.08/.33 with an axis of 70 degrees. This is a
normal tracing and unchanged from his previous tracing on 9/20/86.Edwin Workman
#612-48-04-0                  - 2 -          November 09, 2086
 
Therefore, Mr. Workman is stable at this time from a cardiac
perspective.  We will make the necessary adjustments in his medical
regimen according to his laboratory results.
 
Best regards.

HPI: 61y/o male who underwent heart transplant in 2083 and has ESRD on HD (recently started -&gt; 9 sessions so far FAT). 
He is been electively admitted from his cardiologists office w/ slightly elevated troponins peaked at 0.41, most recent 0.24.  He is CP free and stable and is being transferred for further evaluation and work up.  Last HD session on Tuesday. 


Last dobutamine echo last year showed some LV apex hypokinesis, which augments in response dobutamine. 


ECG revealed NSR at 82 w/ poor R wave progression on anterior leads. Qwave on AvL but no new TWI or ST changes. 


Echo at OSH reveiled lower EF at 30-35% with HK on anteroseptal, mid anterior, apical lateral and apical inferior walls segments. 


He reports chronic dypsnea on moderate exertion. He is quite sedentary.

IMPRESSION
61 yo M s/p heart transplant and ESRD on HD presenting with elevated troponin. The trend of his creatinine from outside hospital is not suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. Troponin leak is a common finding in patients with ESRD on hemodialysis since the hemodynamic changes lead to subendocardial ischemia during short-time ultrafiltration. On the other hand, due to the difficulty in evaluating ACS in patients that had undergone transplant, will repeat cardiac markers for the next 12 hours and meanwhile, continue medical management with ASA, statin, BB and heparin. The lower EF on outside echo could suggest as well recent past event of myocardial infarction, especially with the multiple walls demonstrating hypokinesis. 
&gt; Continue other home meds.
&gt; Check CSA level in am.
&gt; Since stable volume status, consider contacting renal in am for further decision about next HD session depending on lab results. 
&gt; Will continue lasix on nonHD days. 
&gt; Will defer further testing to primary cardiologist in am.

RE:Fair, Bill

MR#:220-41-86-4

 

Dear Dr. Keys:

 

Dr. Oates and I saw Bill Fair today with regard to his troublesome 

right knee.  As you are aware he is a 56 year old man who is a convenience store manager.  He has had a lot of trouble with his right knee over the years, 

mainly related to sports injuries.

 

He has had in particular 2 years of pain now in his right knee.  It got so 

bad 6 months ago that he required large amounts of ibuprofen to relieve that. 

 

It has slowly got better since then.  

 

At present his main problem is pain in the knee which mainly occurs with 

activity but he also has rest and night pain.  He has a restricted walking 

distance.

 

With regard to function, he is able to carry out his work with difficulty and 

requires periods of rest in the evening on returning home from work.  He has 

noticed his knee is becoming slowly more bowed.  

 

With regard to treatment he has is taking regular analgesia in the form of 

Tylenol but has recently noticed blood in his stool for which he is going to 

have a colonoscopy in the near future.  

 

He has not tried any canes and has not had any physical therapy as yet.

 

On examination I note he has bilateral varus knees, worse on the right than 

the left.  He has an antalgic gait and marked varus thrust.  

 

He has a marked effusion that does not have any gross swelling indicative of 

arthritis.  He has a 5 degree fixed flexion deformity and flexes up to 115 

degrees.  His varus deformity is not fully correctable.  He has grade 5 

quadriceps power.  

 

X-rays reveal marked degenerative changes in his right knee with complete 

obliteration of joint space on the right side.  

 

I note he also has changes in his left knee indicative of medial compartment 

arthritis but his left knee is currently asymptomatic.  

 

We have discussed the operative options for him which consist of high tibial 

osteotomy, a unicompartmental knee replacement, and a total knee replacement. 

 

At present neither he not Dr. Oates feels that his symptoms are severe 

enough to warrant operative intervention.  We would certainly reconsider 

should he run into trouble in the next few months aspirating his knee, 

instilling some corticosteroids.  We have advised him that this will only 

provide him with short term relief but may allow him enough relief to begin 

some walking and fitness in an attempt to lose some weight.

 

We have organized to see him again in 4-6 month's time at which stage we will 

reassess him.  Should he run into trouble in the meantime he cal certainly 

ring up and make an appointment to come and see us and we will aspirate the 

knee and instill some corticosteroid.  

 

With kind regards.  

 

Yours sincerely,

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:  Elizabeth Keys, M.D.



CHIEF COMPLAINT:  diabetes management.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Fair is a 61-year-old patient with a history of diabetes diagnosed more than 20 years ago.  He has known complication of retinopathy and is status post bilateral laser surgery about one year ago.  He has no known neuropathy or nephropathy.  He has no known history of CAD, CVA or PVD.  He had previously been followed by Dr. Elizabeth Keys at Pioneer Hospital at Findlay until June of this year which time he switched to a new primary care doctor.  At that time, he had been on glyburide, metformin and Avandia, his new PCP increased his glyburide and his Avandia.  He also stopped his hydrochlorothiazide out of concern that this is not an ideal agent for a diabetic patient. Over the next weeks to months, the patient had progressive peripheral edema, fluid weight gain and ultimately development of dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  He returned for care and was started on furosemide and has been recently titrated up to a dose of 60 mg orally on this.  He self adjusted his Avandia dose from 4 mg twice daily to 2 mg daily.  His prebreakfast blood glucose has been elevated ranging from 160-200.  He has had some resolution of his fluid overload with the Lasix and lower dose Avandia.  He says he has persistent feeling of swelling and tightness in his fingers and toes with episodic ankle swelling as well.  He denies chest pain, claudication polyuria, polydipsia.  He has been losing weight since starting Lasix.  He has never had hypoglycemia.



DIABETES SURVELLIANCE AND MANAGEMENT:

Hemoglobin A1c 11.4% (10/01/84).

Cholesterol 190, LDL cholesterol 190, HDL 49 (10/01/84) and LDL 118 (07/02/84).

Microalbumin to creatinine 19 (07/02/84).

Creatinine 0.9 (07/02/84).

Last eye exam 09/83.

Pneumovax never.

Influenza vaccine never.

Aspirin 325 mg daily.

ACE inhibitor yes (lisinopril 10 mg daily,).

Statin yes (Lipitor 40 mg daily).



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

Diabetes as above.

Diabetic retinopathy.

Hypertension.

Osteoarthritis of the knees.

Status post hammertoe repair.

Pilonidal cyst status post I&D.

Severed Achilles tendon status post repair.

Right meniscus removal.



MEDICATIONS: Glyburide 10 mg twice daily, metformin 1000 mg twice daily and the Avandia 2 mg daily, Lipitor 40 mg daily, lisinopril 10 mg daily.  furosemide 60 mg daily, multivitamin one tablet daily and Viagra as needed.



ALLERGIES:  Amoxicillin gives him a rash.



FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.



SOCIAL HISTORY:  He works as a manager in a convenience store, he lives with his wife.  He has no kids.  He does not exercise secondary to joint pain.  He tends to eat a lot of carbohydrates and meats although he does not have a sweet tooth.  He denies tobacco, alcohol or recreational drug use.  



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per HPI, otherwise, negative.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His weight is 270 pounds, his blood pressure is 150/92 and then 155/92 to my a repeat exam, pulse is 70 and regular.  In general, he is a well-appearing gentleman in no acute distress.  His skin is warm and dry.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Oropharynx is clear.  Mucous membranes are moist.  He has no carotid bruits.  His thyroid is normal in size and contour.  Lung exam reveals crackles at the bases.  His heart is regular in rate and rhythm with an S1, S2, without S3 or S4.  Abdomen is obese, soft and nontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  His extremities are without clubbing or cyanosis.  There is 2+ pitting edema to the ankles.  His foot exam reveals that his distal pulses are okay.  Sensation is intact to monofilament.  There is no skin breakdown or ulcerations.  He has an extensive onychomycosis of the nails bilaterally.



Glucose 132.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 61-year-old gentleman with type II diabetes complicated by retinopathy and erectile dysfunction.  He has had inadequate glycemic control on oral agents which are currently at their maximal doses given the intolerable side effects of Avandia.  He has plans for elective knee replacement during the spring and we have advised him that before he consider that he should get his diabetes under better control, should make sure his blood pressure is controlled and should seek cardiac evaluation, especially given his history of pulmonary edema symptoms on Avandia.



1.  We will start insulin today initially NPH 25 units at bedtime to replace his evening dose of glyburide.  We have instructed him on use of the Inolet for insulin administration.  He will continue his glyburide 10 mg each morning, continue metformin 1000 mg twice daily and Avandia 2 mg each morning.  We will check hemoglobin A1c today as a baseline. We will follow up to determine appropriate titration of his insulin as well as addition of other doses during the day.

2.  His blood pressure is not optimally controlled at this time.  We will increase his lisinopril to 40 mg daily. He will continue his furosemide 60 mg daily and he will continue to titrate his Lasix dosing at the guidance of his primary care doctor.

3.  His last microalbumin to creatinine ratio and creatinine were normal.  Testing is up-to-date.

4.  The patient has an LDL that was above target this summer and Lipitor was initiated; however, he has not been on this long enough to see an effect. At his next visit, we will reevaluate his lipids to determine if his Lipitor needs titration.

5.  He is overdue for an eye exam and will contact Dr. Xuereb at Findlay him to have this done.

6.  We have made a referral to Dr. Liam Mcmahon for cardiology evaluation.  We have ordered an echocardiogram to be performed prior to this visit. We have also referred the patient to a number of possible PCPs in the OMC/CBC system. 



The patient was advised to return to the office in two months for follow up.

Florence Mildred Yuan, M.D.
Endocrinology/Osteopathic Medical Center

Plymouth, IN  46368

Dear Dr. Yuan:

I saw your patient, Bill Fair, in the Cardiology Office today for evaluation of his coronary artery disease in anticipation of knee replacement on March 23, 2085, and thank you for having him come here for evaluation.  I will be sending a copy of this letter to
Dr. Oliver Oates as evaluation for preop assessment as well.

Mr. Fair is a 61-year-old male who has a number of risk factors for coronary artery disease but is unaware of any known prior manifestations.  He has had diabetes mellitus for about 20 years.  About two months ago, he started on insulin, and he is now followed by you at the Endocrine Group.  His most recent glucose had been in the range of 86 with his lipids including total cholesterol of 157, triglycerides 103, HDL of 42, and LDL of 94.  His current medical regimen for these and his other problems include insulin NPH 10 units in the morning, 25 units in the afternoon, glyburide 20 mg q.d., and metformin 1000 mg q.d..  He also takes Lasix 60 mg per day, lisinopril 40 mg per day, and Lipitor 10 mg q.d.

His other risk factors are notable for hypertension, which has been labile and borderline high in the past.  He is currently on the lisinopril with apparently good control of his pressure.  He has had hypercholesterolemia and is now doing well on Lipitor.  He does not smoke cigarettes, but he is obese.

He has no known history of MI, angina, or shortness of breath.

His other risk is notable for his family history, which includes his father who died at the age of 72 of an MI as well as leukemia.  His mother died at the age of 74 of mesothelioma, and he has two sisters and one brother who are well.

He had an echo performed on February 2, 2085, in anticipation of his knee surgery in March 2085, and this was notable for a mildly dilated left ventricle with mild concentric LVH.  Overall LV function is mildly-to-moderately reduced with an estimated ejection fraction of 40%.  The entire inferior and posterior walls were akinetic and thin consistent with myocardial scar.  The apical anterior wall, apical lateral wall, and left ventricular apex were hypokinetic suggestive of myocardial hibernation or scar.  The right ventricle was normal in size and function, the left atrium was mildly dilated, the aortic valve was unremarkable, the mitral valve was slightly thickened with mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, and the tricuspid valve was structurally normal.

His past medical history is notable for kidney stones, which he has had over the past 10 years or so.  He has had three or four attacks, the most recent one was two years ago.
He also has the severe osteoarthritis of the lower extremities predominantly affecting the knees.  Both Achilles tendons have been damaged as well apparently.  He is anticipating knee replacement with Dr. Oates on March 23, 2085.

Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use.  He has a convenience store and frequently eats out of it throughout the day with poor dietary habits.

His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.

On exam, he is obese but comfortable.  Blood pressure is 150/80, heart rate of 67 and regular, and weight of 278 pounds.  Head and neck are unremarkable.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.  PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 are normal with a physiologic split.  There is an S4 and 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border.  Abdominal exam is unremarkable without organomegaly.  The abdomen is obese.  Extremities show no edema or cyanosis.  Carotid upstrokes are normal in contour and volume without bruit.  Distal pulses are normal.

His resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm with evidence of previous inferior MI and poor R-wave progression, V1 through V3.  He has a superior axis likely related to the inferior MI.  The QRS is increased with nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay.

Mr. Fair clearly has evidence of coronary artery disease with at least one myocardial infarction.  This had been entirely asymptomatic and was quite a shock for Mr. Fair to hear this information.  We will obtain an adenosine MIBI scan prior to his surgery to be sure we have a better idea of the status of his myocardial perfusion.  In addition, I strongly encouraged him to lose as much weight as possible.  He seems both very interested in losing weight but at the same time somewhat cavalier an overly confident that he will be able to do so.  I think the most important thing is going to be dietary management, since I doubt he will ever be able to do enough physical activity to burn sufficient calories to lose weight on that basis alone.  We will check his Chem-25 today as well as CRP, and I will review these results with him as soon as they are available.
I also asked him to check on his blood pressure at home and let me know the results.
If any problems develop in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.  We will hopefully be able to identify his preop risk factor status with his perfusion scan within the next week.  Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.

Kindest personal regards.

Re:	Bill FAIR

	OMC 220-41-86-4



Dear Dr. Mcmahon:



I had the pleasure of caring for Mr. Fair at OMC 03/20-21/05.  He is a 61-year-old man with CAD, DM, high cholesterol, HTN, and family history of early CAD, who had a stress test that showed peri-infarct ischemia in the left circumflex and PDA.  Angiography showed a codominant system, a 100 percent left circumflex occlusion, an 85 percent RC lesion, and nonobstructive LAD lesions.  The left circumflex was recanalized and a Taxus 2.5mm by 32mm stent was placed.  The procedure was done with Angiomax and the sheath was pulled manually.  There were no complications.



He spent an uneventful evening without complaints or complications, ambulating without difficulty.  His groin was soft and tender with ecchymosis but no hematoma.  Extremities were warm with 1+ edema to the ankles; pulses were 2+ throughout.  Morning labs included cholesterol of 114, triglycerides 109, HDL 34 and LDL 58.  He was discharged home on NPH insulin; Mucomyst, 600mg bid; aspirin, 325mg qd; atenolol, 25mg qd; Lasix, 60mg qd; glyburide, 10mg qd; lisinopril, 40mg qd; Lipitor, 40mg qd; Diovan, 80mg qd; Plavix, 75mg qd; metformin, 500mg bid to be restarted on 03/23/85; and sublingual nitroglycerin, prn chest pain.  He will require aspirin for life and Plavix for six months; he will not stop either medication unless told to do so by you.  His HDL is low and given his degree of atherosclerosis, you may wish to start gemfibrozil or Niaspan.  He will see you in follow-up in the next two weeks.  Thank you for allowing us to share in his care.  Please call if you have questions.



Sincerely,

Chief Complaint: 

Shortness of breath



History of The Present Illness:  

	Mr. Kaufman is a 53 year old man with a history of Insulin-requiring DM, HTN, chronic renal failure and Hepatitis C presents with a chief complaint of acute onset shortness of breath. He was in his usual state of health when one week PTA he decided to abruptly discontinue his Fentanyl patch, which he had for three years at 75mg for pain associated with peripheral neuropathy and gastroparesis. He recently decided he no longer wanted to wear the patch because he was concerned about personality changes and side effects of the medication. His PCP instructed him to taper the medication, switching him to a 50 mg patch, but Mr. Kaufman removed the patch without a taper. 

He felt fine for a few days, but began to experience pain in his feet, LE edema, insomnia and rhinorrhea.  On the day of admission, he was watching television when he experienced the acute onset of shortness of breath and chest tightness. He described the chest tightness as    like someone sitting on    his R chest below his shoulder, with a band-like distribution across his upper chest, intermittent, non-radiating and somewhat relieved by moving his R shoulder.  This pain lasted 4-5 minutes but his shortness of breath persisted. The shortness of breath was worse with exertion, not improved with rest and caused his to take rapid shallow breaths. He also began to have a non-productive cough this same day. This was the first time he has ever experienced this chest discomfort and shortness of breath. He denies nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, acid reflux sensation, PND, orthopnea, fever or sick contacts.

Radiology

	CXR 9/06/62: IMPRESSION: MILD INCREASE IN LINEAR OPACITIES LIKELY SECONDARY TO INTERSTITIAL EDEMA.



Cardiogram

EKG 9/06/62 04:41- 87 BPM, NSR, non-specific T wave abnormalities consisting of inverted T 

waves in aVL (unchanged from previous EKG 12/30/60), no evidence of ischemic changes



Assessment/Plan:

	In summary, Mr. Kaufman is a 53 year old man with a history of insulin-requiring DM, hypertension, chronic renal failure and Hepatitis C who presents with acute onset shortness of breath and chest tightness in the setting of opioid withdrawal. His initial cardiac markers were positive, but are hard to interpret as a sign of ischemia in the setting of renal failure. He has clinical evidence of pulmonary edema and findings on CXR suggestive of interstitial edema. However, his JVP was not elevated and he only presented with mild LE edema.  His symptoms of shortness of breath are consistent with left-sided heart failure, possibly caused by an ischemic event. His acute renal failure has multiple possible etiologies (some of which could occur concurrently) including CHF, drug toxicity (lisinopril and NSAIDs), DM-associated nephropathy, chronic hypertension and renal artery stenosis.



Problem List and Plan:

SOB/Chest tightness:

	--continue to cycle enzymes for R/O

-CXR AP and lateral to assess presence of pulmonary edema

	-TTE

	-diuresis with Lasix 20mg IV

	-Hydralazine 10mg QID & Isosorbide dinitrate 5mg PO TID 

	-d/c Lisinopril

-continue O2 at 2L, monitor O2 sat

	-monitor ins and outs, daily weights

	-obtain lipid panel to assess CAD risk factors and need for statin

Renal failure: acute over chronic, baseline nephropathy due to DM and HTN, history of 

+protein in urine, urine sediment spun, no signs of active sediment 

-urinary electrolytes to measure FENa

-d/c Lisinopril

-dose Neurontin according to renal function

-consider ruling out renal artery stenosis

-obtain urinary eosinophils to evaluate for interstitial nephritis

Hypertension: hypertensive emergency considered, but determined to be unlikely due to 

chronity of elevated SBP at similar values, under treatment

	-continue Toprol XL 100mg QD, Norvasc 5mg BID

-add Hydralazine 10mg QID, Isosorbide dinitrate 5mg PO TID

-monitor BP and signs and symptoms of target organ damage closely

Opioid withdrawal/pain management:

	-Morphine PRN

	-consult pain service

DM:

	-sliding scale insulin

	-obtain Insulin and C peptide levels because unclear if currently taking Insulin

Prophylaxis:

	-20mg Nexium PO QD

	-Heparin 5000 units SC BID

INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES

CAPE CORAL HOSPITAL



Personal data and overall health   The patient is a 53-year-old white male, who presents for followup of multiple medical problems.



Major Problems

Diabetes mellitus

Very noncompliant for many years.  Previously had blood sugars as high as 400 to 600 and would not take any medications.  Diabetes complicated by peripheral neuropathy, which is severe; gastroparesis, which has been severe; recurrent skin abscesses; and probable coronary artery disease.

Hypertension

This has been also severe for many years and noncompliance is a significant issue.  Now complicated also by significant orthostatic hypotension presumably on the basis of autonomic insufficiency.

Coronary artery disease

He is status post recent non Q wave MI with elevated troponins presenting with congestive heart failure and chest pain in the setting of an elevated creatinine.

Chronic renal insufficiency

Creatinine approximately 3.

Pyelonephritis HISTORY OF



Anemia

Chronic.    Extensive workup negative.

Sinus tachycardia

Chronic.  This has been present for many years.  Etiology unclear.  Recent stress test does not show evidence of more complicated arrhythmia.  Cardiac ultrasound was done on his recent admission, and he has an ejection fraction of 63% with no significant valvular disease.  He has symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.

Migraine headache HISTORY OF



Hepatitis C

Chronic.



Allergies

No known allergies   



Change in therapies and Renewals

senna 2 teaspoons  BID

aspirin 325 mg  qd

hydralazine 25 mg  TID

Imdur 30 mg  QD

Lasix 20 mg  qd

Nexium 20 mg  qd

Norvasc 5 mg  BID

Neurontin 100 mg  TID

labetalol HCl 100 mg  BID

losartan 25 mg  qd

erythromycin 250 mg  TID

Epogen 3000 units sq qwk

Colace 100 mg  BID



Family history   Notable for diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.



Social history   He was previously the head statistical programmer for electronic data systems for many years and now disabled.  He is married and has a daughter.  Cigarettes, none times years.  Alcohol, previously heavy.  There was a history of previous illicit drug use.



Review of systems   Since he has been home, he has done reasonably well though he has noted increasing leg edema bilaterally with a significant weight gain.  He denies chest pain or palpitations.  He denies shortness of breath.  He has not been vomiting, and he actually self-discontinued both OxyContin and methadone because he felt that they did not make him feel well.



Physical examination

Pulse   86 per minute

Blood pressure 150/90    Today, 150/90 then 144/86

Weight   185 pounds

Heent   Eyes, ears, nose, and pharynx are normal, but dentition is poor

Neck   No bruits

Nodes   None palpable

Chest   Lungs, clear

Cor   Regular rate and rhythm without murmur

Abdomen   Benign

Extrem   With 3+ massive edema

Neuro   Abnormal gait due to peripheral neuropathy



Assessment and plan   Leg edema is uncertainly due to his vasodilators.  We will discontinue hydralazine and Norvasc.  He has already stopped his OxyContin and methadone.  We will see him back in approximately two weeks to follow up on his blood pressure.  He will have routine laboratory studies done today.

for pain relief and had pain relief and was sitting in a chair. 

His lying down on his right side was painful, and this morning,

sat up and while getting up, exacerbated the chest wall pain. 

The patient discussed this pain with his primary care physician

during the past 2 weeks and who had been in agreement that it is

probable muscle strain.  The patient denies any headache, visual

changes, and dizziness.  Denies any neck pain.  Denies any

left-sided chest pain.  Denies any nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis,

or dyspnea.  Denies any abdominal pain.  He has been afebrile.

CXR:

FINDINGS:

	No infiltrates or evidence of CHF is present.  There is a three cm

	mass in the right lower lung.  This was shown to be rounded

	atelectasis on chest CT.  Pleural changes are consistent with

	asbestos related pleural disease.

	



IMPRESSION:

	Asbestos related pleural disease

	Right lower lobe mass shown to be rounded atelectasis on chest CT.

	FINDINGS:

	No comparison.  The aorta is of normal caliber.  There is

	atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta.  Classic arch anatomy

	is present.

	Bilateral pleural calcific plaques are demonstrated consistent

	with asbestos related pleural disease.  In addition, in the

	posterior segment right lower lobe there is 2.7 cm mass.  The mass

	has a linear pleural attachment adjacent to pleural plaques.

	There is also present swirling vessels around the mass and volume

	loss.  The findings are consistent with rounded atelectasis.  A

	smaller focus of rounded atelectasis is present in the left lower

	lobe.

	Coronary artery calcifications present.  No mediastinal or hilar

	or axillary lymphadenopathy is present.  There is no

	supraclavicular adenopathy.

	The osseous structures are unremarkable.

	Please see dictated abdomen report.

	



IMPRESSION:

	1.  Normal caliber aorta please see MRA report regarding

	evaluation of dissection.

	2.  Bilateral rounded atelectasis and asbestos related pleural

	disease.

	

	



   WMC  MRA AORTA + &  01-Aug-2076 09:10 





REPORT:

	This study was reviewed with Dr. Upshur.

	MRA OF THE THORAX WAS WITH AND WITHOUT GADOLINIUM.

	Technique: Standard departmental MRA protocol of the chest and

	upper abdomen was performed with and without gadolinium. 3-D

	images were obtained and interpreted.

	Findings:

	There is a three vessel aortic arch.  There is no evidence of a

	flap within the aorta to suggest a dissection. The takeoffs of the

	great vessels are normally patent. There is no evidence of

	aneurysm.

	The celiac artery and SMA are patent. There are single renal

	arteries bilaterally.  There is mild narrowing of the proximal

	right renal artery.  The left renal artery is patent.

	



IMPRESSION:

	Unremarkable MRA of the thoracic aorta, without evidence of

	dissection or aneurysm.

	Mild narrowing of the proximal right renal artery.

EKG: NSR. LBBB. 1mm STD I/II/aVf/V5-6. 2mm STE V1-3. TWI I, biphasic T-wave V5-6. (No change from prior ekg)



Impression: 71M hx DM, HTN, HLP, p/w chest pain likely GI related and not cardiac in origin.



Plan: 

1.	chest pain: Unlikely cardiac in origin given negative EKG, recent normal stress test, and atypical nature. Likely GI related as pt with dry heaving around time of chest tightness.

-cont asa, simvastatin, atenolol, irbesartan, and lasix

-repeat EKG in AM

-cycle cardiac enzymes, telemetry

-check lipid panel

-maalox prn



2.	decreased visual acuity: Most likely worsening macular degeneration given recent chronic history of symptoms. Absence of pain makes retinal vascular occlusion very unlikely, no other neurological symptoms to indicate CVA. 

-refer pt back to MVH once ruled out for MI

-consider I- CT if more neuro symptoms develop to r/o acute stroke



3.	Diabetes: -check lipid panel, hemoglobin A1c

-RISS, glipizide

-hold pioglitazone (not in formulary)



4.	proph: nexium, heparin

Avandia 4 mg q. day, (she had incresed skin itching with attempts to increase the dose)

Lipitor 10 mg q. day,

Aspirin 325 mg a day (she is not taking aspirin).   


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS 
Ms. Yount denies any recent visual change, headaches.  She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, fever, chills.   


PHYSICAL EXAM 
Ms. Yount looks well.  Blood pressure is 148/90.  Body weight is 188.  Repeat blood pressure is 170/80.  On examination of head and neck - no absolutely.  Thyroid is soft, nontender, no nodules.  Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation.  Heart - regular rate and rhythm, no S3.  Abdomen is soft, bowel sounds present.  Extremities - trace edema.  
 
LABORATORY 
Pending.  
 
IMPRESSION 
Ms. Yount has diabetes and hypertension with a mildly elevated creatinine.  Her urine shows presence of protein, which suggests diabetic nephropathy.  Upon review of her medications, she is on a very good medication control, and  her blood pressure has been well controlled.  However, today the blood pressure is running higher.  I will see her in about two to three months.  If her blood pressure continues to be high, we should try to increase her dose of ARB.  I also explained to Ms. Yount the importance of taking aspirin and that she should continue her daily aspirin.

Patricia is a 70-year-old retired woman, right-hand dominant, who comes with complaints of soreness in her right wrist.  She apparently had a fall, which caused substantial pain and some swelling, but no bruising.  Brought her in to have an evaluation.  X-rays showed no fracture and over the last few weeks things have improved substantially, and she comes in just because she was told to get it checked out by her doctors, but otherwise feeling quite good and wondering if the appointment is even necessary.  

 

Past medical history includes high blood pressure and diabetes.  

 

No prior surgeries.  

 

No medications.  

 

No known drug allergies.  

 

Lists no family history of any problems.  

 

Lives alone and used to smoke, but quit.  

 

On examination, she has full range of motion of her wrist compared to the opposite side.  No atrophy, ecchymosis, edema or deformity.  Negative scaphoid shift test.  Slight tenderness over the distal radius.  Normal tendon function.  

 

My impression is that she must have got a mild sprain, which has recovered or possibly even a nondisplaced fracture given her age and osteoporotic bone, but whatever this was, it has resolved almost entirely, she is functioning well, and there is no apparent problem, so I will see her back as needed.

Admission Note

HPI: 73 year old woman with hypertension, DM, peripheral vascular disease presents with dyspnea on exertion for 2 days. Th patient was well and normally active with walking and usual activities without DOE until 2 days ago. Last routine visit was in 9/91 w/ her PCP and was fine. 2 days ago noted DOE when going to store. This persisted w/ activity only. The patient was fine at rest and was able to sleep without difficulty. There were no recent changes in her meds. She had no other symptoms including CP, dizziness, URI symptoms, fever, chills, GI symptoms. No PND, orthopnea.



She previously had a cardiac evaluation during a similar presentation in 2085. She had a low level stress test and echocardiogram. No ischemia was demonstrated at a very minimal exertion. The echo showed LVH and an EF of 61%. Because of an impending snow storm, she decided to come to the hospital for evaluation. In the ED her BP was elevated and her 02 sat was only 78% on RA.



PMH:

1. Diabetes mellitus: on medical regimen, HgA1c 7.3 (9/91).



2. Hypertension: Blood pressure is 140/72.  Echocardiogram 12/85 - EF 61%, LVH. ETT 12/85 - 4 METS, no wall motion abnormalities.



3. Hypercholesterolemia: on Lipitor 10, LDL 78 (4/91).



4. Peripheral vascular disease: arterial studies 10/90 - left SFA occlusion, and bilateral distal popliteal/ tibial

vessel disease.  She is well collateralized across the ankles at rest and poorly collateralized across the ankles post exercise.  Perfusion is adequate to the TM level, and poor to the digital level, bilaterally



5. Anemia: normocytic normochromic anemia with a normal SPEP and UPEP and iron studies. Baseline hematocrit of low 30's.



6. Obesity. 



7. Osteopenia with a history of right radial fracture.

CXR (AP): No radiographic evidence of an acute cardiopulmonary process.



CT chest/abd/pelvis: 1. No evidence for pulmonary embolus to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries.  However, evaluation of the pulmonary vasculature is suboptimal due to respiratory motion. 2. No evidence for deep venous thrombosis. 3. Small right pleural effusion. 4. Intravenous contrast noted within the hepatic veins which could be secondary to CHF.



EKG: NSR, LVH, 1st degree AVB, nonspecific ST, TW changes.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 73 year old woman with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia who presents with exertional dyspnea. The patient's history, exam and CXR are not consistent with CHF. The CT scan r/o PE and may be consistent w/ failure, but not clear. More likely would be ischemia and is ruling out for an MI. Clearly needs cardiac reassessment with echo and ETT. Last ETT in 2085 but was normal at a very low level of exertion. Finally, could this be a primary pulmonary process? If her 02 sat of 78% in the ED is true, this should be pursued if cardiac evaluation is negative. Specifically could she have an interstitial pulmonary process corresponding to imaging and exam w/ fine crackles. Arguing against this is the acuteness of her symptoms. Continue current regimen w/ holding Avandia and metformin.

CXR: 1.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and mild interstitial pulmonary edema, consistent with CHF. 2.  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.





EKG: no ischemic changes



Impression:  pulmonary veno occulsive disease, diastolic dysfunction with mild CHF exacerbation.  Her resting O2 sats are back to baseline and she does not appear to be in significant decompensated failure.  Unfortunately, we don't have much more to offer her in the way of cure (she has declined other interventions with pulmonlogist), as this is generally a terminal illness.



Plan:



--admit to medicine for further obs on tele.

--complete cycling enzymes

--continue outpatient lasix dose.

--adjust n/c oxygen as needed

--pulm/pt rehab consult -- pt has declined inpt rehab, but whatever might be offered as outpt would be helpful.

--i will speak with her re: potential for hospice care since she has declined inpt rehab at last and with this admission.  This might help forgo further hosptilizations with similar treatment at home.

--Continue DM treatment w/ glucophage/glyburide.

--anticipate d/c in 1-2 days.

-- pls offer pneumovax if she'll accept it.

-- hold coumadin, recheck INR (pls have anticoag clinic leave note with dosing of coumadin)

-- OOB to chair, ambulate with assistance.

She's doing much better from her painful R facial weakness (? Ramsay Hunt syndrome).  She di dnot take tegretol, but rather increased her amytriptiline and added some darvocet acutely, now off these meds.  Her R eye ""tears a lot"", at no particular time (ie, not necessarily when she's masticating), and occasionally it burns....but she has not developed conjunctivitis or ocular redness or discharge.  She has difficulty chewing opn the R side of her mouth, and finds she""pockets"" food in her R cheek; she manages by chewing on L, and swallowing frequently, especially taking extra liquids.

The pain has receded-  she now only gets ""a twinge"" now and then.



Husband has noticed she's not hearing quite as well.



Her current meds include amitryptiline 25 hs, mevacor 20, procardia 30 bid, furosemide 40x3, isosorbide 20 qd allopurinol 300 qd.  She's releived to learn the results of her recent blood work, including BUN 65 Creat 3.4, Hct 29.8



On exam, she has gained weight since I last saw her; she comes in ok0on wheelchair, but is able to take a few steps with her straight cane, and climb onto the examining tabloe with only contact guard. Dense catarcts; fundi not visualized; EOMS full without ptosis or nystagmus. Cornelas are brisk pilaterally, but she has decreased sensationon the R lower facial segments (V1, V2); excellent masseter and temporalis strength. R lower facial weakness, with less evident weakness of orbicularis oculi; he manages to close the eyelid almost completely; + Bell's phenomenon.  She hears finger rub at 90 cm on R, 70 cm on L; Weber lateralizes to the R, but Rinne' positive bilatyerally (ie, AC>BC AU). Tongue midline.  Modulates voice well.  TMs opaque, but EACs clear.



She has a marked polyneuropathy, with decreased vibration from knuckles to elbows bilaterally Hyporeflexia throughout, but symmetrical.  Strength remains well conserved.



IMP: improving R Bell's. MRI showed much motion, but no gross abnormalities



Plan- continue with current management. I'd welcome the oportunity of seeing her again in about 6 months.

Patient Name: FALLON, SHARON;  MRN: 1703242
Dictated on: 11/11/2074 by PATRICIA DRAKE, N.P., PH.D. 

 
HISTORY:  Mrs. Fallon returns to clinic for evaluation and management of a right posterior ankle ulceration.  Since her last visit to the clinic, she was evaluated by Dr. Frederick Archer who admitted her for a diagnostic angiogram, which revealed that she had adequate perfusion to the ankle level 
to heal the ulceration.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, Mrs. Fallon has ruborous discoloration of the distal half of her bilateral lower extremity with scattered vesicles on the anterior surface of her left lower extremity.  The 
ulceration is on the posterior aspect of the right ankle.  It measured 1.2 cm x 1.2 cm.  The tissue is moist yellow subcutaneous tissue, the margin is clear.  In the setting of ruborous discoloration, it appears that Mrs. Fallon may have an acute flare of her chronic lipodermatosclerosis.   
PLAN:  Daily wound care per the following protocol; 1.  Normal saline irrigation 30 cc x 3.  A thin layer of 50% Diprolene ointment 0.05% with Bactroban cream to the wound bed and the wide periwound margin.  Primary dressing will be Telfa covered with rolled gauze.  Mrs. Fallon will return to clinic in 2 weeks unless the wound bed is closed and then she will follow up with Dr. Archer on Tuesday, November 26th.

MITRAL VALVE

There is evidence of thickening of the anterior mitral leaflet.  There is

calcification of the anterior and posterior mitral annulus.  There is no

evidence of mitral valve prolapse.  The peak transmitral gradient is 10 mmHg.

The mean transmitral gradient is 5 mmHg.  There is mild to moderate mitral

regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler.

LEFT ATRIUM

The left atrium is dilated.



AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT

Multiple aortic leaflets are thickened but there is no stenosis.  The aortic

valve is tricuspid.  There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or

spectral Doppler.



LEFT VENTRICLE

The left ventricular cavity size is normal.  The left ventricular systolic

function approaches the lower limits of normal.  There is symmetric left

ventricular hypertrophy.  There is segmental apical left ventricular

dysfunction (see wall motion plot).  There is no evidence of left ventricular

thrombus.  The estimated ejection fraction is 51 %.



TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC

There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of trace tricuspid insufficiency.



RIGHT VENTRICLE

The right ventricle is not dilated.  The right ventricular systolic function

is within normal limits.



PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES

There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.  There is a space between

visceral and parietal pericardium most c/w pericardial fat.



CONCLUSIONS

Compared to the study of 9/12/73, the EF has dropped by 10% and apical wall

motion abnormalities are now noted.





CCU Course/Plan	

72 year old woman with ESRD, positive troponin in setting SOB and pulmonary oedema on CXR. Suspect  leak  from demand.  



1)	ischemia: ASA, BB. Would doubt she needs urgent cath but will hold NPO for potential cath in am.  Would not add heparin. Check fasting lipids.



2)	rhythm: so far not an issue. BB as tolerated. 



3)	pump: she has LVH and likely diastolic dysfunction.  Would prefer to have ACE on board - will d/w renal as to why not.



4)	ESRD - can go for HD today. Need to contact dialysis unit to arrange time.



5)	DM 2 - SSI for now, will likely give back Lantus tonight. She is v reluctant to have SSI, will give at half usual doses.



6)	FEN cardiac, diabetic diet. Hold NPO pending possible cath in am.



7)	Prophylaxis: GI: Nexium, DVT: Heparin IV; BM: prn. 



8)	Dispo - to SDU today

CC:  73 yo woman admitted with recurrent hypotension preventing hemodialysis



HPI:  Putting together Ms. Falon's story from her personal history, she has had type 2 diabetes for many years and is now suffering from many of the complications of that disease, including retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy. This lead to ESRD and hemodialysis starting 18 months ago, using a left forearm AV fistula that recently required catheter based intervention after clogging for a second time. Also related, at least in part, to her diabetic disease is coronary artery disease leading to a non-ST elevation MI in December 2074. Since then she has had bouts of what appears to be her anginal equivalent- left ear pain and a sense of fullness in her lower chest that occur at rest and are fleeting, going away before she has time to try a SLTNG. In addition, Ms. Fallon states that her blood pressures have run much lower, on occasion preventing the removal of fluid during dialysis, which leaves her edematous and more fatigued than normal. She is on a STTh HD schedule, but came to the EW four nights ago with hypotension in the setting of HD. She did not go to HD today, as her SBP was again too low.  Using a home machine, Ms. Fallon recorded SBPs in the 80's and complains of frequent periods of dizziness, especially when getting up from the seated position. She is unable to lie flat 2/2 to orthopnea. She denies recent fevers, chills, SOB or chest pain. Lower extremity swelling continues to be a problem and she is complaining of left heel pain.



PMH: ESRD as a result of DM on HD, DM related retinopathy/neuropathy; h/o infected tunneled catheter; hyperparathyroidism; HTN in the past; CAD s/p NSTEMI 12/74, echo in Jan 2074 showed EF 52%; CHF;  PVD with RLE ulcer followed by Dr. Archer; h/o  GI bleed with negative upper endoscopy , pending colonoscopy, umbilical and hiatal hernia, cervical CA 6 years ago s/p hysterectomy; gout; benign breast tumor; h/o DVT s/p filter placement; h/ hypercalcemia, depression



PSH: TAH 6 years ago; left arm AV fistula s/p thrombectomy x 2, most recently one week ago



Medications: Allopurinol 200 po qd, Mevacor 20 po qd, Quinine 350 po BID, Concerta 3 tabs qd, Colace, Pericolace, Tylenol #3 prn, Nephrocaps 1 tab po qd, ASA 81 po qd, Lantus insulin 50 units qam, Tums 1 tab po tid with meals

Alternative meds: None

Allergies: MSO4 cause SOB; Novocaine causes seizure



Family history: Non-contributory



Social history: Lives at home with husband of 34 years, two children from previous marriage live in the area, has grandchildren. Used to work in construction.



Risks: Never use tobacco, rarely used alcohol, no injection drug use



Review of systems: (+) some vaginal blood spotting recently. No recent HA, nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, cough, sputum production, diarrhea, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, abdominal pain.



PE: Elderly, pale woman in NAD. T 97.7 degrees, BP 117/62, HR 84, RR 24, Sat 99% on RA. HEENT: NC,ST, PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, non-injected, arcus senilis no oto/rhinorrhea, oral mucosa moist, no cervical LAD or tenderness, no thyromegaly, neck supple, no supraclavicular LAD or bruits. HEART- RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no S3, S4 or murmur. PULM- CTA bilaterally with moderate to good BS bilaterally, no wheeze, rales or rhonchi. ABD- soft, NT, ND, BS+, reducible herniano HSM or masses, no aortic, hepatic or renal bruits. EXT- Bilateral brawny edema of LE. SKIN- changes if chronic venous statis of LE with tender shallow fissure of left heel. NEURO- A/O x 3, conversant, well-formed sentences, appropriate although somewhat flat, but laughed occasionally, CN 2-12 intact, visual fields intact bilaterally, DTRs 1+ and symmetric in triceps, biceps, quads and achilles, strength 4/5 bilateral U and LE



Data: Na 136, K 5.6, Cl 96, HCO3 29, BUN 69, Cr 10.2, Glu 96, Ca 9.3, PO4 6.9, Mg 2.0, Alb 2.9; WBC 12.2 no diff, HCT 32.7, PLT 247; PT 13.5, PTT 24



ECG: NSR with occasional ectopy, RBBB and 1st degree AV block, no e/o ischemia or infarction



Imaging:  CXR today shows pulmonary venous hypertension with interstitial edema and small pleural effusions bilaterally. Patchy opacity at the left lung base most likely represents alveolar edema or atelectasis.



CODE status: Unknown



Focused problem list:  Hypotension limiting hemodialysis s/p MI 3 months ago, DM, neuropathy, depression



A/P: 73 year old woman with likely autonomic instability resulting from long-standing diabetes. In order to effectively counter the level of hypotension that she experiences after HD, she may benefit from interventions that will raise the systemic BP.



1)	Blood pressure

-   Adenosine-stress MIBI today

-	If the above is OK, plant to start midodrine 5 mg po tid



2)	Renal failure

-   Check lytes in AM

-	To HD in AM

-	Already received kayexalate in EW tonight

-	Increase Tums to 2 tabs po tid with meals for hyperphosphatemia



3)	Vaginal spotting

-   Pt has a gynecologist here at RH, will contact re: imaging vs other, esp in setting of h/o cervical CA

-	HCT stable

Hypertension.  



Spinal stenosis and sciatica.  



Lower extremity PVD.  This was shown on angio 9/83 (Dr. Xayasane), but she denies claudication.  



Right foot-drop due to shingles.  



Hypercholesterolemia.  



Ectopic beats as below.  



Nonsmoker.  



She takes Pravachol 40 mg q.p.m., PhosLo 1300 mg t.i.d.-q.i.d., Sensipar 30 mg daily (for calcium), Restoril 30 mg q.h.s., Neurontin 900 mg every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Norvasc 10 mg b.i.d., Nephrocaps one tablet daily, plus vitamins.  No allergies.  



Retired Mathematician at Vassar.  Widow.  Lives alone.  Has daughter in the area (an surgeon).  



PE:

Appears a little frail.  No neck masses or bruits.  Chest clear.  Heart:  Frequent ectopic beats.  4/6 systolic murmur.  Mild abdominal adiposity.  Palpable LLQ kidney.  No other masses or organomegaly.  Groins normal.  No pedal edema.  3/4 femoral pulses, with nothing below.  Large non-thrombosed permanently prolapsed right anterior internal hemorrhoid and associated large external hemorrhoid.  Moderate external hemorrhoids elsewhere.  Digital rectal exam normal.

                                                                                                                                   Mae Paul

                                                                                                                                   LMC# 100-57-08










Flexible sigmoidoscopy to 25 cm (sigmoid) normal except mild diverticulosis.  



IMPRESSION:

Large symptomatic hemorrhoids.  They are too big for office treatment.  Therefore discussed the option of hemorrhoidectomy, which would probably give her a nice result.  She wishes to think about it for now, however, which is fine.  In the meantime, gave her info brochure plus instructions in conservative RX hemorrhoids.

(665) 578-7821                     03/06/2087


CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 75-year-old woman, new patient who comes in to establish primary care and for followup of multiple medical problems including end-stage renal disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, history of foot drop, etc.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  End-stage renal disease.  Because of her original end-stage renal disease was reportedly FSGS, she had a preemptive transplant in 2068, which was complicated by rejection and ultimate loss of the graft.  She resumed dialysis in 2072.  She had a second transplant in 2075, which was also complicated and ultimately rejected.  She resumed hemodialysis in 2082.  She does have a match with her only daughter, but apparently the Transplant Service feels that she would not be a good candidate and I think she would be reluctant to go through two surgeries, which would be required, one to remove the old graft and one for the new transplant.  She currently is dialyzed at the Overbrook Hospital.  Her dialysis physician is Dr. Lemus.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Peripheral vascular disease.  She had an angiogram in 2083 at LMC and an MRA in 2085, which showed bilateral iliac and femoral artery stenoses.  She apparently does not have claudication despite this.
4.  History of right foot-drop.  She had a severe episode of shingles in 2077 with associated sciatica and foot-drop.
5.  History of hemorrhoids for at least six years with occasional bleeding and with anal protrusion.
6.  History of CMV colitis in 08/2081.
7.  Secondary hyperparathyroidism.  She is on Sensipar and has been on this since early 2085.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She had a supracervical hysterectomy for benign disease in 2061 and a left salpingo-oophorectomy for a serous cyst in 04/2082.  She is status post appendectomy.  She is status post bilateral cataract surgery.

MEDICATIONS:  Norvasc 10 mg per day, lisinopril 20 mg per day, metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 40 mg per day, aspirin 81 mg per day, Nephrocaps 1 mg per day, Restoril 15 mg nightly, Hectorol 4 mcg per 2 mL three times per week, B6 200 mg per day, vitamin E 400 mg per day, flaxseed oil 1000 mg per day and B12 4000 mcg per day.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes in her father and grandfather, negative for cancer.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a widow.  She is a lifetime nonsmoker.  She does not drink alcohol or use drugs.  She is a retired mathematician at Vassar.  She came from Turlock 10 years ago to Pecos to be with her daughter who is a surgeon in the area.  She never has felt the Pecos as home and is home sick for Turlock.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She has had some problems with left shoulder pain and immobility.  She generally seems to be somewhat overwhelmed and a little bit sad.  She seems never to have adjusted to life in Pecos.  She has had the loss of two the kidney transplants and then the foot-drop, which has made walking difficult.  She did have a brace at one time, which helped her to walk, but it was irritating.  She had seen Dr. Yim to get another one, but that never worked out.  She did not complain of any chest pain or shortness of breath, no constipation.  She does have hemorrhoids that are active as above.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is a well-developed, well-nourished, very pleasant, but somewhat sad-appearing white female.  Her blood pressure is 140/60.  HEENT, pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Throat is clear.  Neck, supple, no adenopathy or thyromegaly.  Heart, regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs, clear.  Abdomen, soft, nontender, no organomegaly.  Extremities, no edema.  Neuro, absent reflex in the right patella and 2+ in the left patella.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  End-stage renal disease on dialysis, not considered to be a transplant candidate at this time as she has had two rejections.
2.  Hypertension, well controlled on medications.
3.  Hyperlipidemia, on Lipitor.  Last cholesterol was checked in 10/2086 with normal ALT and AST, but elevated alkaline phosphatase.
4.  Peripheral vascular disease, currently asymptomatic.
5.  Right foot-drop.  We may look into getting her another brace perhaps another consult with Dr. Yim.
6.  Left shoulder pain.  It did mention in her physical, but she can only abduct her left shoulder to about 90 degrees without pain.  We may look into this further and perhaps get some physical therapy for possible rotator cuff tendinitis.
7.  Hemorrhoids.
8.  Secondary hyperparathyroidism on Sensipar.
9.  Health maintenance.  Mammogram was done in 06/2086.  Pap smear was done in 04/2083.  Colonoscopy was done in 08/2081.
10.  ? Depression.  She seemed a little sad.  Has had a tough time with her medical problems and never adjusted that well to Pecos.  Will have her come back and discuss further.

EDVISIT^83288425^PAUL, MAE^04/30/90^CORTES, ODESSA

The patient was seen in conjunction with resident, Dr. Peacock. 

Resident's note was reviewed.  The patient was seen and examined

by me.  Please see the resident's note for details of the

patient's past medical, social, family history, review of

systems, and physical exam.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bleeding fistula.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old woman with

end-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis, who is here with

bleeding of her left upper arm AV fistula that she uses for

dialysis that started today at dialysis.  When the patient pulled

up her sleeve, she scratched herself and it began to bleed. 

Blood pressure is 112/60.  The bleeding can be controlled with

compression and so she presented to the Emergency Department

where she was seen by the Internal Medicine for repair.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a history of severe aortic

stenosis with 0.7 cm greater diameter, mitral regurg and

tricuspid regurg, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, PVD,

foot drop, anemia, sciatica, left thigh pain, hyperlipidemia,

secondary hyperparathyroidism, hemorrhoids, coronary artery

disease status post non-ST elevation MI, CHF with an EF of

35-40%.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes a TAH, appendectomy, cataract

surgery, ovarian cyst removal.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Never smoked, does not drink or use drugs.  She

is retired, lives with her daughter who is a surgeon.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Shows an extensive vascular history.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is afebrile, normal and stable vital

signs.  She has bilaterally faintly scattered rales on chest

examination and she has a small laceration on the left arm over

the fistula with an excoriation and this squirting blood would

not controlled with pressure.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC is normal with a hematocrit of 43.  Chem-7

is otherwise normal.  Coags reveal an INR of 1.4.  Chest x-ray

shows no acute disease.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  She was seen by surgery who repair

her fistula.  She is due to go to dialysis now and due to sickle

nature of her disease, I think it is best that she keep her

dialysis appointment and so she is transferred from here with her

daughter to the EHCC Dialysis Unit to undergo full dialysis.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSES:  Bleeding aVF and end-stage renal disease.

DISPOSITION:  She is discharged in satisfactory condition.

RE:  Vivian Lea Jorgenson

     MR#471-90-84-7

 

Dear Dr. Geiger:

 

Thank you for referring your patient, Victoria Carina Jorgenson to me for a

preoperative evaluation for thyroidectomy on September 17, 2071. 

As you know, she is a 64 year old woman with hypertension,

hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease. 

She noticed a nodule in her neck in April or May of this year and

brought it to the attention of her doctors and given that it has

increased in size, it is felt to be a potential malignancy and

she is currently scheduled to undergo thyroidectomy in September

of this year.  In terms of her cardiac history, she was well

until four years ago when she developed acute shortness of breath

and was admitted to Lake Park Hospital for congestive heart

failure.  At that time, she had an exercise Thallium scan which

revealed a low work load at only 3 minutes stopping secondary to

shortness of breath with a large fixed anterolateral defect and a

dilated left ventricle.  In addition, she had an echo in June of

2071, which shows an ejection fraction of 25% with 1+ mitral

regurgitation, left atrial enlargement and diastolic dysfunction. 

She has never been hospitalized since that time for her

congestive heart failure and has been treated medically with good

result. She currently denies any orthopnea, PND, angina or

claudication.  She does have chronic mild lower extremity edema.

In fact, she has never had chest pain or chest pressure to her

recollection.  She is able to walk up the 10 stairs to her house

and can unload groceries from her car, up those stairs. She is

able to shop, walk through the grocery store without difficulty

from chest 

 

Jorgenson, Vivian Lea

MR #471-90-84-7               -2-            August 21, 2071

 

pains or shortness of breath, although she occasionally stops

secondary to fatigue.  

 

Her past medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia,

CHF, chronic anxiety and this thyroid nodule. She has never had

surgery. Her family history is significant for a mother who died

of myocardial infarction at the age of 55. 

 

Her social history, she smoked 1-2 packs of cigarettes a day for

40 years and quit four years ago. She denies alcohol, intravenous

drugs or cocaine use.  She lives with her husband and briefly

worked in Amy's Baking Company but for the past 20 years is an electrical engineer.  She

has no known drug allergies. 

 

Her current medications include Labetalol 100mg po BID, Captopril

50 po TID, Digoxin 0.25mg po QD, Coumadin 5 po QD, Lipitor 10 po

QD, Lasix 40 po QD, Coreg 12.5 po BID, Nitroglycerin patch daily

and Gemfibrozil 600mg BID.  

 

On physical exam in my office, her blood pressure was 170/85 in

her left arm and 165/70 in her right. Her heart rate was 104 when

I saw her, although it was 80 on her EKG today. Her JVP was 7

centimeters. Her carotids were brisk upstrokes without carotid

bruits. Her chest is clear to auscultation without crackles. Her

heart has a non displaced PMI with a regular rate and rhythm with

occasional ectopic beats. She has a normal S1 and S2 with a 2/6

systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border without

radiation. Her abdomen is soft with positive bowel sounds. Her

extremities have 2+ distal pulses and trace peripheral edema.  

 

Her EKG today is normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 80.  She has a

diffuse ST and T wave abnormality consistent with Digoxin

effects.  She has poor R wave progression consistent with an old

anterior septal MI but no acute ischemic changes.  

 

In summary, Ms. Jorgenson is a 64 year old woman with hypertension,

hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease

with congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%,

likely secondary to coronary disease from an anterior myocardial

infarction, although she has never undergone heart

catheterization.  She is currently undergoing evaluation for a

thyroidectomy for a thyroid nodule. 

 

Jorgenson, Vivian Lea

MR #471-90-84-7               -3-            August 21, 2071

 

Issue number one,  preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment: 

given that she has not had an assessment of her ischemic burden

since 2067, I have scheduled her for a repeat exercise test with

imaging. If this is similar to her previous study showing only

fixed defects and no reversible ischemia, then I feel that she

will be of low to moderate risk for surgery for perioperative

myocardial infarction and that her congestive heart failure is

well treated and therefore, will not preclude her from having

surgery.  

 

Issue number two, is her anticoagulation for low ejection

fraction.  She is currently on Coumadin for low ejection

fraction. As far as I know, she has never had atrial fibrillation

and she has never been told that she had an irregular rate or

rhythm.  Therefore, I recommend that she stop her Coumadin 6 days

prior to surgery and it can be restarted several days after

surgery without Heparin overlap at the discretion of the surgeons

as to how may days she should wait after surgery before

restarting that medication.  She will otherwise remain on her

current medical regimen as determined by her cardiologist and

primary care physician, Dr. Charles Van.  If her stress test

is without reversible defects, she need not follow up with me for

further evaluation.  

 

Thank you for referring this interesting patient. She was seen

and examined with Dr. Voss. 

 

Sincerely,

MR# 471-90-84-7

November 24, 2071

 

This is the first visit for Ms. Jorgenson who is a 64 year old woman who presents 

for management of papillary thyroid cancer.  Her symptoms began in May, 2071, 

when she felt a prominence in her neck.  She did not experience any dysphagia 

or voice changes, but presumably was felt to have an abnormality on thyroid 

examination.  She underwent a thyroid biopsy in June, 2071, at a local 

hospital.  The pathology which was read at JMH revealed numerous follicular 

cells with chromatin grooves suspicious for papillary carcinoma.  She was 

subsequently referred to Dr. Geiger at JMH for thyroidectomy and underwent 

thyroidectomy on 9/17/71.  The thyroidectomy was uncomplicated though there 

was inadvertent displacement of a parathyroid gland and this gland was then 

reimplanted.  According to the operative report, the carcinoma was felt to be 

locally extensive though no laryngo-tracheal nerve invasion was present.  The 

pathology revealed a (R) 6 cm papillary carcinoma with capsular and 

lymphovascular invasion.  There was an additional focus of papillary 

carcinoma, follicular variant, in the (L) thyroid lobe that was 0.3 cm.   Of 

note, the tissue was stained for calcitonin and this was negative.  The tumor 

did stain positively for thyroglobulin.  

 

Since undergoing thyroidectomy, Ms. Jorgenson has done fairly well.  She has been 

maintained on 75 mcg daily of Levoxyl.  She says that she feels generally 

well on this dose though she does endorse slight fatigue.  She denies any 

changes in her sleep, hair, skin or bowels.  She does endorse a one pound 

weight gain over the last two months.  She denies any paresthesias or other 

symptoms consistent with hypocalcemia.  She denies any history of thyroid 

disturbances prior to her diagnosis of cancer.  She is now referred for 

consideration of radioiodine ablation.  

 

Past Medical History:Notable for congestive heart failure.  She has an 

ejection fraction of 25%.  She also has a history of hypercholesterolemia, 

hypertension, and anxiety.  No history of childhood irradiation.  

 

Current Medications:Digoxin 0.25 daily; Coreg 12.5 mg daily; Levoxyl 75 

mcg daily; Lipitor 10 mg daily; Coumadin 5 mg daily; Lasix 40 mg daily; 

captopril 50 mg, tid; labetolol 100, bid; nitroglycerine.

 

Allergies:No known drug allergies.

 

Social History:Remote history of tobacco.  She quit 4 years ago.  She 

endorses rare alcohol use.  She is married with four children.  

 

Family History:Negative for thyroid cancer.  

 

Physical Exam:Blood pressure is elevated at 188/92.  Weight 208.  Pulse 

88.  In general this is a somewhat tired, slightly pale-appearing woman in 

NAD.  HEENT:  PERRLA.  EOMI.  No proptosis or lid lag.  Neck: supple with a 

large well-healed thyroidectomy scar.  No

remaining thyroid tissue or lymphadenopathy is appreciated.  Lungs: clear to 

auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular: normal S1, S2, regular rate and 

rhythm.  Abdomen: soft, slightly distended, non-tender, moderately obese.  

Extremities: trace pedal edema, 1+ distal pulses.  Neurologic: reflexes are 

slightly delayed.  There is no tremor of outstretched hands.  

 

Review of Labs:Of note, include a TSH of 1.65 from August, 2071, that was 

prior to surgery.  Free T4 at that time was normal at 1.1.  Calcium prior to 

surgery was slightly elevated at 10.6 though several calciums drawn after her 

surgery were in the mid-8 range. 

 

Impression:This is a 64 year old woman with a history of congestive heart 

failure who is now s/p total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer.  Ms. 

Jorgenson is potentially at higher risk for recurrence given the fact that she is 

older at the time of diagnosis, she had a large-size tumor, and she had 

multifocal disease. 

 

Plan:Check a TSH and thyroglobulin today for a baseline.  We suspect that 

she may be undertreated on her current dose of Levoxyl.  I have recommended 

131I treatment.  Benefits and risks were discussed.  In addition, I think she 

would tolerate thyroid hormone withdrawal.  TSH and calcium were drawn today. 

 

We will plan to arrange  for 131I for January.

Dear Dr. Van:

I had the pleasure of participating in the care of VivianLee Jorgenson during her recent hospitalization at Goulds Hospital.  This lovely 67-year-old female ended up having no discernable coronary artery disease on catheterization.  At the time of the cath, her pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 12.  During the course of her hospitalization, we noted as well that she had had runs of nonsustained VT and asked our EP colleagues to comment on the appropriateness of an ICD.  They felt that this could certainly be rediscussed in the future, but at the present time, there was no compelling indication for her to receive an ICD.

Her medications at discharge include Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d., digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d., captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d., enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., Nexium 20 mg p.o. q.d., Synthroid 300 mcg p.o. q.d., Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d., Coreg 25 mg p.o. b.i.d., and Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.d.

It has been a delight to participate in the care of this lovely woman.  If there is any questions or issues, please feel free to call.

Sincerely,

EDVISIT^47190847^JORGENSON, VIVIANLEE^05/29/78^XUEREB, VESTER

I saw this patient with Dr. Wendy Wu, resident.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chief complaint on the chart is ataxia, when I

speak with the patient chief complaint is weakness.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 71-year-old female with a

history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.  She presents with

episodes of gait instability, diffuse weakness, multiple falls. 

She was brought in by her family for further evaluation.  She

also had dark stools over the past few weeks.  She denies any

associated chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, any

syncope, any nausea or vomiting.  She does have a bruise on her

chin.  She denies any focal weakness, numbness, or tingling.  No

hematuria, no epistaxis or gum bleeding.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, atrial

fibrillation, hypertension, coronary artery disease,

hypercholesterolemia, and thyroid disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with family.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted in the written chart and the HPI,

otherwise negative.

MEDICATIONS:  Include ranitidine, baby aspirin, Coumadin, Lasix,

and digoxin.

ALLERGIES:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.5, pulse 60, respiratory

rate 20, blood pressure 136/60, and oxygen 95% on room air. 

General:  This is a pleasant female, elderly; she has got a 3-cm

ecchymosis over her mid left chin as well as over her left

shoulder.  Her pupils are reactive.  Neck is supple. 

Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation.  Cardiovascular:  Regular

rate.  Abdomen is soft.  Rectal is heme-positive, heme-positive

melena per the resident.  Skin is otherwise with bruises over the

left arm as well as a bruise over the right thumb that appears

healing.  Extremities are with good range of motion.  No focal

tenderness.  She is oriented x3.  Mood and affect are normal. 

She is moving all extremities equally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Chest x-ray shows no acute cardiomediastinal

process and head CT preliminary shows no intracranial

abnormalities.  Laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit

of 16, creatinine of 1.5, BUN of 95, troponin less than 0.04, and

platelets of 358.  INR of 2.  Urinalysis with 2+ ketones, no

blood.

INITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  This 71-year-old female presents

with generalized weakness and gait instability and frequent

falls, concerning for either an evolving intracranial process

such as a subdural or stroke.  This has been going on for several

weeks, however, but also presents with melena over the past

several weeks and profound anemia for which she required

transfusion in the Emergency Department.  We did order a CT of

the brain to evaluate for intracranial injury or abnormality both

given the frequent falls and as the cause of the falls.  This

does not show any large subdural or mass lesion.  She is quite

anemic has melanotic heme-positive stool.  I suspect this is the

etiology, but it seems like it has been a slow progression, and

concerned given her cardiac history also the weakness and could

represent coronary insufficiency.  She does not have an elevated

troponin at present.  She will need to be further monitored.  She

was transfused here in the Emergency Department given her

profoundly low hematocrit after consent was obtained. 

Clinically, feels better.  I discussed with the patient's family

because of the bleeding he will need to be evaluated as ____

further cardiac biomarkers and further monitoring as well as

physical therapy evaluation once the patient's acute medical

issues have been addressed.  She will be admitted to the medical

service with diagnosis of symptomatic anemia, gastrointestinal

bleeding, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation in

stable condition.

RE:		Jarvis, Amador

PCC#:		090-73-07



January 20, 2088



Reason for visit:  Mr. Jarvis comes to follow up on his hypertension, hyperglycemia, renal insufficiency and elevated PSA.  



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He has seen Dr. Jose Quirk and a prostate biopsy has been recommended.  This is scheduled for next week and Mr. Jarvis is quite anxious about it.  



He began the Captopril and HCTZ (? or Maxide) and has noted good blood pressure control as checked at BH.  At first he developed a considerable cough but in the last two weeks this has largely resolved.  He states that the cough is productive of thick phlegm and may reflect a respiratory infection rather than the Captopril itself.  His blood sugars when checked at home have averaged between the 140 to 150 range fasting.  On one occasion a three hour postprandial was 170.  



He has had no attacks of gout or gout like arthritis in the past six weeks and is quite pleased about this. 



He has continued actively managing production and is planning a trip to Italy next month.  



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today he looks well and comfortable.  His blood pressure is 140/76 right arm sitting with regular pulse of 68.  His weight is 173 (stable).  



IMPRESSION:  Doing reasonably well on the new blood pressure program.  Since the cough is resolving it would seem reasonable to continue the present program.  



We will look forward to seeing the results of the prostate biopsy and we will check glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin today.  He will return in four months for follow up.  





Orvell Oliver, M.D. 

Labs:  Hemolyzed sample shows K of 6.0.  Will check re HCTZ vs Maxide.  If the latter, will change it.

                                                         Date of Visit: 05/11/2089





REASON FOR VISIT:  Mr. Jarvis comes for a regular 6-month followup 
visit.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He has been feeling extremely well without 
any illness or any unpleasant symptoms.  He is working hard as a production manager, and he will have some time off this spring.  He and his wife are 
planning a trip to Italy and Greece, and following this, they will spend mostly 
long weekends in New Mexico.

He has not had shortness of breath, orthopnea, or edema.  The pains in his hips 
and legs have not been bothering him.  When he tests his blood glucose level, he 
gets results that range between 170 and 120.  He has not been specifically 
exercising, but does try to park his car at some distance from shops and stores 
and walk the intervening distance.  He continues on 1/2 tablet of atenolol 50 mg 
per day along with 1 Hyzaar tablet per day.  Otherwise, the review of systems is 
unremarkable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He looks cheerful and fit.  Blood pressure in the 
right arm, sitting 140/86 with regular pulse 64.  Chest is clear to P&A.  Heart 
sounds are very faint, but appear normal with normal rate and rhythm.  Neck 
veins are not distended.  Abdomen is nontender.  Extremities have good dorsalis 
pedis pulses.  Sensation in feet is intact to light touch and vibration.

IMPRESSION:  Very stable with regards to hypertension.  He remains 
moderately hyperglycemic.  He has an appointment to be followed by the 
urologist, Dr. Jose Quirk, in the next month for his elevated prostatic-
specific antigen (the prostate biopsy showed intraepithelial neoplasia   
considered only a risk factor).

PLAN:  We will check the usual laboratory work, and we will let him know when 
the results are available.  He should return in 6 months.

Mr Jarvis: The glucose when you were here was 244 and the average calclated from the HbA1c is 171; despite your efforts and exercise and diet.  I think it would be wise to start on a low dose of a glucose-lowering medicine, glipizide (Glucotrol).  I would start on 1/2 of a 5 mg pill twice a day and continue checking your blood sugar levels from time to time.  If they stay a bit up, then increase to one whole pill (5 mg) twice a day.  Then we will see how that effects the blood sugar.  I don't think this will interfere with your trip.  Call me in a week to tell me how it is going.



Best wishes,

Reason for Visit

Mr. Amador Jarvis comes for an annual visit and physical exam, and to follow-up on his diabetes, hypertension and elevated serum creatinine



Problems

      Hyperexpanded lungs

      Hypertension

      Elevated creatinine

He has been generally healthy since last visit.  He notes that his morning fasting glucose values usually range between 130 and 140 mg percent.  He has not checked his blood pressure frequently but feels that it is under reasonable control.



He has been followed by Dr. Quirk for his prostate and has regular ophthalmological visits for his eyes.  He also has regular dermatology visits.



He does not notice any unusual shortness of breath with exertion, and in fact since he has been exercising regularly he feels that his breathing has improved.



Review of Systems

General - Neg; Weight stable.

Eyes - Neg; No problems with vision.

Ears - Neg; Hearing not impaired in a quiet room though some difficulty in a noisy environment.

Nose - Neg; No nasal allergies

Mouth - Neg; Teeth, throat, chewing normal.

Heart - Neg. No pain or abnormal heart beats.

Lungs - Neg; No cough or sortness of breath.

GI - Neg; No heartburn, abdominal pain,constipation, diarrhea, rectal bleeding.

GU - Neg; No pain or difficulty with urination.  t Musc-skel - Neg; No painful or swollen joints.

Skin - Neg; No rashes, severe acne, abnormal moles.

Neuro - Neg; No weakness, numbness, shakiness.

Emotional - Neg; No unusual sadness or anxiety.



Exam

Mr. Jarvis is a healthy, comfortable appearing man. Blood pressure right arm, sitting is 136/70 with regular pulse 72.  Weight is 174 lbs. Ears, drums, canals, hearing within normal limits. (Eyes are regularly examined). Mouth, teeth, tongue and throat normal.  Neck, thyroid, nodes, carotids normal. JVP fills below the sternal angle.  Chest is clear to percussion and to auscultation both quiet breathing and forced maximal expiration. Diaphragms are somewhat low. Heart is normal size and has normal rate, rhythm and sounds with no murmurs or gallops.  Abdomen has no tenderness, masses or enlarged organs.  There is an area of muscular weakness in the anterior abdomen producing a partial ventral hernia.  Extremities have good pedal pulses and no edema. Skin has many keratoses of various sizes and shapes but is free of suspicious lesions.

Rectal and prostate examination have been done by the urologist.



Assessment

Mr. Jarvis appears to be in stable health with hypertension and diabetes under good control.  His elevated serum creatinine seems to be causing no problems.  His prostate is being carefully followed and shows no signs of progression.



Disposition and Plans

We will check laboratory work today and let Mr. Jarvis know the results when they're available.  He will keep in touch and return as necessary but should return for a regular follow-up visit in six months.

	Reason for visit:
   Elective cardiac catheterization prior to CABG


	Interval History:
   Cardiology admission note for Dr. Ickes 
This is an 82 year old male with CAD, DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and CRI who presents for elective cardiac catheterization for reevaluation of an RCA stent, which was placed in 12/95 in the setting of an STEMI. This catheterization is in preparation for planned CABG by Dr. Xaysana on 4/23/96. 

Mr. Jarvis's cardiac history began in 12/95, when he was shoveling snow.  At that time, he developed dizziness, diaphoresis and nausea. He went inside and had an episode of syncope which lasted approximately 5 minutes. His initial EKG showed 1 mm STE in II, III and aVF and 1 mm STE in V5 and V6. An EKG seven minutes later showed an increase in STE in the inferior leads and STE in V3 to V6 with a max of 4 mm in V3. He never developed chest pain. An emergent cardiac catheterization at that time showed a left main with minor distal disease. The LAD had a proximal 80% stenosis. The LCx had mid 40% diffuse disease. The 1st OM had a tandem lesion of 90%. The RCA was large and dominant and had a proximal ulcerated 90% stenosis with haziness. Given these findings, a 2.5 X 15mm BMS was placed into the proximal RCA with and excellent result. His peak CK was 305 during that admission. An echo performed at that time was a technically difficult study, which showed diffuse inferior hypokinesis. He was discharged home in 12/95 in stable condition and follow-up with Dr. Xaysana in his office to discuss possible CABG. It was decided that the patient should have a repeat cardiac catheterization prior to the CABG to determine whether RCA restenosis is present. He is then scheduled to have CABG with Dr. Xaysana on 4/23/96. 

The patient has been feeling well at home from a cardiac standpoint. He denies any chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, pedal edema, orthopnea, PND, or syncope. He does report some bilateral thigh claudication, noting that he can walk about 0.5 miles before he has to stop secondary to leg pain. He denies any calf pain.

MICRO:  BCX sent; stool sent for fecal leukocytes, C. diff, O&P



Colonoscopy:  08/20/2073 - normal colon.



Abd/Pelvic CT:  

Air within the gastroepiploic and portal vessels as described, without specific bowel pathology.  Heterogeneously enhancing masses within the pelvis as described, likely representing exophytic uterine fibroids.  Recommend ultrasound of the pelvis for confirmation.  Possible small gallstone within the gallbladder without CT evidence for cholecystitis.  Fatty liver.



CXR:  	NO EVIDENCE OF PNEUMONIA OR CHF.



KUB:  NO EVIDENCE OF OBSTRUCTION OR PERFORATION.



EKG:  NSR at 90 bpm, diffusely flattened T waves, no ST abnormalities 



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

60 year old woman presents with a history of watery diarrhea, gas and diffuse abdominal pain for the past two weeks that has increased in intensity in the last 3 days.  For the month prior to the onset of diarrhea she reports that she had been constipated.  No fevers or chills; patient is afebrile and the WBC is not elevated.  Her abdominal exam is remarkable for obesity, tympany and mild LLQ tenderness.  Finding of air in the gastroepiploic and portal vessels with no associated intraabdominal pathology is of uncertain significance.  Fibroids, which have been previously diagnosed, are seen.  Normal colonoscopy 08/20/2076.



1) GI:  Constipation for a month followed by diarrhea for two weeks.  This history is suggestive of overflow diarrhea.  Patient denies recent narcotic usage and no obstructing lesions are seen on CT scan.  May also be infection, malabsorption, osmotic, inflammatory, secretory or a motility defect.  No evidence is seen for ischemia, inflammation or infection.  Bowel dysmotility resulting from DM may play a role in a motility disorder.

 - Diet: clears now, NPO after midnight

 - Stool for fecal leukocytes, O&P, C. diff

 - Bowel regimen:  colace, senokot, miralax

 - Reglan PRN nausea

- Follow clinical exam

 - Follow WBC, T, lactate for signs of acute sepsis or ischemia

 - Appreciate GI input (Dr. Utterback)

 - Apprecate surgery input (Dr. Espinosa)

 - Ranitidine prophylaxis, zofran PRN nausea



2) Gyn:  Patient is s/p breast cancer and has fibroids.  No evidence of abdominal mass other than fibroids.

 - Continue on tamoxifen 20 mg PO QAM



3) Psychiatric:  Depression & anxiety

 - Buspar

 - clonazepam

 - effexor



4) DM2:  Continue home meds (metformin + insulin), hold when on diet without substantial calories (clears, NPO)



5) Prophylaxis:  patient is ambulatory; ranitidine; commode by bedside.

I have interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the

resident's documentation, and concur except as noted.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old female who

presents complaining of chest pain and lightheadedness for the

past 4 days.  The patient has a medical history remarkable for

breast cancer, status post mastectomy and node dissection, which

have given her chronic left axillary pain.  The patient states

that this chest pain that she felt is distinct and is

nonexertional.  It is associated with increased fatigue and

shortness of breath associated with it.  Today, states that the

dyspnea resolved after being given oxygen in the ambulance en

route and called her primary care physician who told her to come

to the Emergency Department.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for diabetes and

hypercholesterolemia.

OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY, SURGICAL HISTORY, SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY

HISTORY, REVIEW OF SYSTEMS, MEDICATIONS, AND ALLERGIES:  As

noted.  The patient is an active smoker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Emergency Department, the patient

is awake and alert, nontoxic appearing, afebrile, with stable

vital signs.  HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic.  Oropharynx

clear, moist mucous membranes.  Neck:  Supple, without

meningismus or midline tenderness.  Respirations clear with no

rhonchi, rales, or wheezes.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate

without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,

without rebound or guarding.  Skin is warm, well perfused without

petechiae or lesions.  There is no edema, no calf or thigh

tenderness, no CVA tenderness.  Neurologically, she is alert and

oriented x3, normal mood and affect.  No cranial nerve

abnormalities.  No sensory or motor deficits.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had an unremarkable CBC and

chemistry panel with flat enzymes and normal coags.  EKG was

sinus with no ectopy, interpreted as normal, chest x-ray, which

showed postoperative changes but no infiltrate or edema in this

patient with nonvertiginous lightheadedness and chest discomfort

in the context of shortness of breath and generalized malaise.

PLAN:  Plan is for admission, serial enzymes, and risk

stratification.

CC:         chest pain

  

HPI:

This is a 65 yo female with T2DM, HL, active smoking, breast cancer s/p BL mastectomy and chemoradiation, and a question of a lupus-like disorder who presents with chest pain.  She was seated at breakfast this AM when she developed sudden onset ripping chest pain which radiated &#8220;like a knife&#8221; to her upper back.  It was associated with nausea but no vomiting or diaphoresis or shortness of breath.  It did radiate down both arms, but she her arm pains are now new.  It was not relieved by any positioning, or largely affected by taking deep breaths.  It tapered off over about 20 minutes.  She felt fatigued and layed down, when it occurred again several hours later, again lasting for about 20 minutes.  She then presented to DCA-ED for evaluation.  She had a negative adenosine MIBI at JMH in 2078.



She has had a difficult time recently, she is under evaluation for a lupus-like syndrome (she has noted positivity for ANA, anti-smith, anti-dsDNA).  She has had progressive joint and muscle pain of all of her major joints (ankes, knees, hips, wrists, elbows, shoulders, neck, lumbar back) and the muscles of her arms and legs.  She endorses progressive mental &#8220;cloudiness&#8221;, frequently dropping items like cutlery and cups, and increasing tremor in her hands.



DCA ED Course:

Initial EKG NSR without ischemic changes

Initial biomarkers strongly positive with CKMB 33 and Troponin 0.36.  CXR unremarkable.

She was treated for NSTEMI with ASA 325 mg X 1, heparin gtt, IV lopressor.

She had a brief episode of CP which was relieved by SL NTG and morphine.

She was sent to SDU for further evaluation and treatment.

ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN

This is a 65 yo female with T2DM, HL, active smoking, breast cancer s/p BL mastectomy and chemoradiation, and a question of a lupus-like disorder who presents with chest pain, + troponins, unremarkable EKG.  Cardiac RF = age, DM, HL, active smoking.  TIMI score = 3 (age, asa use, + biomarkers).  DDx = ACS (high risk NSTEMI), aortic dissection (concerning elements of hx), PE (given cancer hx, on SERM), or perimyocarditis (question associated with lupus-like condition).  The lack of hypoxia or tachycardia argue against PE.  Given her risk factors, after exoneration of her aorta by CT scan, she should undergo cardiac catheterization to assess for epicardial disease.  She is currently CP free.



1.    Chest pain

-     CTA chest to rule out aortic dissection now

-     If CTA negative, heparinize, begin integrilin drip (given TIMI of 3), continue ASA, statin, SL nitrate prn, likely coronary catheterization in AM.  Cycle serial cardiac enzymes and EKGs.

-     If positive, transfer to unit for invasive hemodynamic monitoring, aggressive dP/dT control, and CV surgical consult

-     TTE in AM

-     Check amylase, lipase 

-     Risk stratify with HbA1c and FLP in AM

-     Smoking cessation consult



2.    Lupus-like condition

-     Alert rheumatology team to admission in AM



3.    DM

-     Check HbA1c

-     BID NPH and AC+HS RISS



4.    Renal

-     renal prophylaxis give planned dye loads &#8211; mucormyst 1200 BID + IV bicarbonate



5.    Psych

-     continue home regimen &#8211; klonopin, effexor, topamax

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51-year-old woman who returns after recent acute coronary syndrome experience and for follow up of other medical problems.


PROBLEMS:
1.  Acute coronary syndrome.  She was in New York and experienced chest pain.  She was seen at Conway Hospital where she underwent placement of two stents in the right coronary artery.  EKG changes suggest IMI.  She was told that she would need further intervention, but comes with no paperwork.  She has had no further chest pain.
2.  Diabetes mellitus.  A1c one month ago was 6.7.
3.  Hyperlipidemia.  Please see prior notes for full lipid analysis, but LDL was 221.  She has been on Zocor.
4.  Mitral valve disease.  Prior to recent coronary event, she underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a mildly thickened and calcific aortic valve with a slight gradient.  There is calcification of the posterior mitral annulus and leaflet as well as the subvalvular apparatus with an echo dense mobile structure and trigger aspect suggesting a partially disrupted chordae.


MEDICATIONS:  
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily.
2.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily.
3.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily.
4.  Zocor 20 mg p.o. nightly though given a prescription for Lipitor 80 mg nightly in New York.
5.  Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. daily.
6.  Metformin 500 mg daily.
7.  Norvasc 10 mg daily.
8.  Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg p.r.n.


REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  No significant weight change, febrile signs or symptoms, headache, blurred vision, tinnitus, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, abdominal pain, nightsweats, diarrhea, dysuria, polyuria, skin rash, bruising, joint pain, or focal weakness.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is in no acute distress.  Blood pressure 120/88, weight 213 pounds, and temperature 97.8.  Chest clear to percussion and auscultation. Cardiac exam; no extra sounds. Rather coarse near holosystolic murmur. No apprecialble 2nd or third compenents. No pedal edema.


EKG today:  Heart rate was 54 and regular with normal intervals.  She has a Q-wave in III and F and slight reversal of R-wave progression in right precordium.  These are distinct change from EKG done one month ago.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  Status post IMI.  Not on beta-blocker and I will not initiate given sinus bradycardia.  I have arranged for her to be seen in Cardiology to determine best next steps.  I tried to contact the cardiologist who took care of her in Conway Hospital whose phone number is 674-449-3338.
2.  Diabetes mellitus.  Good control.
3.  Hyperlipidemia.  Will initiate therapy with Lipitor 80 mg p.o. nightly for this and problem 1 above.  Prior authorization form completed.
4.  Mitral valve disease.

Dear Dr. Barron:


Thank you very much for your kind referral of Frances Preston to the Cardiovascular Division of Weston General Hospital.  I saw her in consultation this afternoon for her diagnosis of a recent myocardial infarction.  Please allow me to summarize her history for our records.


Frances is a very pleasant 51-year-old Danish woman who has cardiac risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recently diagnosed glucose intolerance.  It appears that she had been having a several-month history of anginal-type symptoms, although a stress test obtained in March showed no significant ischemia.  On 04/09/2076 she was in New York helping a family member with start up of a restaurant, when she woke up in the morning with a sudden onset of chest discomfort and lightheadedness, and according to her daughter suffered a cardiac arrest.  She was taken emergently to Cabrini Medical Center where she was found to have an inferior wall myocardial infarction and underwent coronary stenting.  I do not have records from this admission that she does have her stent cards that indicate that she received a 3.5 x 23 and 3.5 x 13 Cypher drug-eluting stents to the right coronary artery.  Per her daughter's report, she had a significant lesion in another blood vessel, which was felt to require percutaneous coronary intervention.  Unfortunately, we do not have details of the remainder of her coronary anatomy.


Since her myocardial infarction, she actually has felt quite well.  She no longer has the angina that she had prior to her MI.  Her major complaints are that she occasionally feels lightheaded and somewhat fatigued but overall feels well.  She is able to walk normal distances without cardiac symptoms.


Her past medical history is notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and glucose intolerance.


Her present medications include aspirin 325 mg a day, Plavix 75 mg a day, metformin 500 mg a day, simvastatin 40 mg a day, nitroglycerin p.r.n., amlodipine 10 mg a day, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg a day, and lisinopril 20 mg a day.


She has no known drug allergies.


Social History:  She is married and has three children.  She is presently accompanied by her daughter Landis who handles the majority of her health care.  Landis can be reached on a cell phone at 944-351-0904.  She has never used tobacco.


Family history is notable for several aunts with myocardial infarctions and a sister whose has had a prior stroke.  There was a significant history of glucose intolerance in the family.


Review of Systems:  Cardiac:  No chest pain, PND, orthopnea, dyspnea, or lower extremity edema.  Musculoskeletal:  No myalgias or arthralgias on lipid-lowering therapy.  All others are negative.


On physical examination, she is an overweight yet well-appearing female in no apparent distress.  Her blood pressure is 131/86 and her heart rate is 61 beats per minute.  Her weight is 213 pounds.  Her neck shows 2+ carotid upstrokes.  There is a hint of a bruit in the left carotid.  The carotid upstrokes are full.  Her lungs are clear to auscultation.  The heart is normal to palpation, no thrills are palpated and the PMI is nondisplaced.  The heart is regular in rate and rhythm and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard best in the right upper sternal border throughout the precordium.  The abdomen is obese, soft, nontender with normal bowel sounds.  Her extremities show no edema.


Her EKG in the office today shows normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 61 with a normal axis and intervals.  She has Q waves and T-wave inversions in leads III and F consistent with her recent myocardial infarction.


I do not have a recent lipid profile on file.


On 04/16/2076, she underwent an echocardiogram.  She has normal left ventricular function with a mild intracavitary gradient of 9 mmHg.  She has mild aortic sclerosis with a velocity across the aortic valve of 2.2 m/sec.  There are no significant wall motion abnormalities.  She has only mild mitral regurgitation.


In summary, well we do not have records, it is fairly clear that Mrs. Preston has had an inferior wall myocardial infarction treated with coronary stenting.  She did receive drug-eluting stents.  The good news is that appears that her left ventricular function is very well preserved suggesting that she did not have a large myocardial infarction.  What is less clear, however, is the status of her other coronaries, there is some suggestion that she may have significant coronary artery disease at this time.


From a clinical standpoint, I certainly do not think that she requires a cardiac catheterization at this time.  She is fairly asymptomatic, and is doing well from the cardiovascular standpoint.  I think what would be more helpful in guiding recommendation is whether she has significant underlying ischemia at this point.  To this end, I have arranged for her to undergo an adenosine PET scan to assess for residual ischemia.  We will guide our recommendations regarding cardiac catheterization based on the results of the study.


In terms of her lipids, it appears that she has been switched to Lipitor.  The goal for her LDL should be in the 70s and her HDLs ideally be in the 40s.


In terms of antithrombotic therapy, she did receive drug-eluting stents.  Therefore, she should certainly remain on aspirin for the remainder of her life and Plavix for an absolute minimum of one year.  After a year, it would likely be acceptable for her to stop her Plavix for brief periods of time should it be necessary for other medical procedures.  However, up until that time her Plavix should not be discontinued without a discussion with myself.


She is on a very good medical regimen, although I think she would benefit from a beta-blocker.  The hydrochlorothiazide appears to be a new medication for her, and therefore I went ahead and discontinued this and started her on extended-release metoprolol at 25 mg a day.  This can certainly be cut uptitrated for better blood pressure control.


I will call her daughter Landis with the results of her PET scan and further recommendations, and we will go ahead and make plans for her to see me again in six months.


Thank you for allowing me to participate in her care.  If you have any further questions regarding her management, do not hesitate to contact me.

Dear Dr. Barron:


I would like to give you followup on our mutual patient Frances Preston.  As you know, I referred her to the cardiac catheterization laboratory because of progressive worsening angina and a stress test suggesting anterior ischemia.  We performed a catheterization on 12/14/2076.  We utilized the right radial artery for access.  We found that she developed a significant in-stent restenosis lesion within the previously placed Cypher drug-eluting stent.  This is undoubtedly the cause of her symptoms.  We were able to treat this lesion with balloon angioplasty and ultimately stented with a 3.5 x 24 Taxus drug-eluting stent.  The stent was postdilated with a 4 mm noncompliant balloon to high pressure.  The final angiographic result was excellent.


The following morning she was doing quite well and we discharged her later in the day.  She will remain on her usual medications and I have stressed the importance of remaining on aspirin once a day for the remainder of her life and Plavix for a minimum of a year after this procedure, though I will likely favor indefinite therapy.


I plan on seeing her again on 01/24/2077 in followup.  If you have any further questions regarding her care, please do not hesitate to contact me.


Sincerely,

ADULT MEDICINE





Date:  May 20, 2094



70-year-old female, first visit to MSH AMED. 



MEDICATIONS:  Ibuprofen 800 mg 1 p.o. b.i.d., has taken for years. Self-d/c'd meclizine, unclear status on H2 blocker.



ALLERGIES: Percocet, codeine, sulfa.



PMH: Includes fibromyalgia with chronic pain, osteoarthritis, recurrent vertigo, cervical spondylosis, lumbar spondylosis, carpal tunnel syndrome, myofascial pain, dizziness, syncope, chest pain of unclear etiology, sinusitis, DJD. Status post laminectomy 2062. 



S:	70-year-old female accompanied by daughter, Qazi, here to initiate primary care closer to home. Previously followed by Dr. Faust, but daughter needs closer PCP. In addition, patient followed in arthritis clinic by Dr. Solomon and has received injections per patient report from severe muscle spasms of both arms. Also seen by pain clinic. Main issue is continued lower back pain and primary care. Of concern is patient reveals an unclear history of chest pain which was thought to be arthritis, but is accompanied by episodes of syncope, witnessed in a grocery store. Patient has not had to her knowledge a cardiac workup for this. Also had some vascular studies done at that time and was told they were normal. The patient is unclear on status of recent pelvic exam. GYN - G7, P7, still with uterus but not sexually active. Denies any change in bowels. Denies any change in appetite. 



The patient has been complaining of animals crawling across her chest. States she used a cream for 1 week with resolution but now feels the animals are back, and she has been using a pesticide agent which sounds like a Kwell agent to resolve these. 



Recent testing - L-spine films confirm grade 2 anterospondylolisthesis L4-L5 with disc space changes at L1-L2. Negative allergy testing. 1/1 immune globulin testing significant for an IgG of 15/40 and positive ANA at 1:40 and 1:60. MRI of spine 12/93 shows degenerative changes of lumbar spine. No evidence of disc herniation or canal stenosis. 11/92 - Paranasal sinus films show no evidence of sinusitis. Mammo 3/94 WNL. Carotid ultrasound done 12/93 shows minimal disease of right and left carotid bifurcations. TCDs 12/93 suggest a stenosis of the left vertebral artery with an RVA WNL. Velocity suggests a mild stenosis. EKG 12/93 shows sinus brad with an LAE. No other significant changes. Nonspecific ST changes. 



O:	HEENT - Unremarkable. Skin - No obvious sign of rash or infection where she states the animals are present. CV - BP is 170/88. RR at 60. No murmurs, gallops, rubs present. Lungs - Clear to P&A. B12 was 331. Attempted Pap smear. External genitalia unremarkable. Vaginal introitus is very small. Patient got very cold and clammy and nervous throughout the tried Pap smear; so Pap smear attempt was terminated at that time. Consent was obtained to conduct Pap smear. Lungs - Clear to P&A. 



A/P:	(1)	Dizziness of unclear etiology. Neuro consult had been done when the patient was hospitalized, and meclizine has not been of any benefit. Will refer patient to Vascular to ascertain whether the TCD findings are related. 



(2)	Report of syncope. Will obtain stress test.



(3)	Chronic NSAID usage. Add ranitidine HCL 150 mg to 1 p.o. q.h.s. to regime. Patient will follow up with Dr. Helen Whitehead as  her new PCP.

A/P:

1)CAD- will look for correspondence from Dr. Mora re: his thoughts.  Consider adding low dose beta blocker, since BP is a little.  Needs mor aggressive lowereing of lipid.  At next visit, repeat lipid, and consider lipitor.

2)Back pain- suspect there is some somatization, but patient is far from being able to accept this.  For now, refilled Ibupfofen and follow how often she refills.  Note in record of patient requesting Vicodan, which was given to her before by Dr. Solomon.  Would avoid if possible.

3)Anxiety- Valium 5 mg #15 mg, prn. Offer counseling at next visit if persists.

4)HMC- will ofer colonoscopy at next visit.

NAME:     Upham, Zelda

MRN:      9656797



Patient is here for a follow-up.  Patient has returned from her trip to Hong Kong.  Says

that it was a bit stifling, because she cannot drive and was dependent on other people

for transportation.



Still has severe right shoulder pain.  Still also complaining of left jaw pain, that is

worse when she has to open her mouth very widely.  Reviewed x-rays, which were

negative for fracture of frontal facial bones, and did not reveal obvious abnormality in

the TMJ area.  Has yet to receive an appointment from Dr. Vann for this

shoulder pain.



Patient was afraid to try the Vioxx, because she was told by the pharmacist that she

could not take it with ibuprofen. I explained to her that she should take the Vioxx in

place of the ibuprofen and she understands.  Is not willing to try Flexeril. 



Patient spent approximately 20 minutes describing her dissatisfaction and difficult

interactions with her children.  Has not asked for more Valium.  Has never been

interested in counseling prior to today.  Did not become tearful like she has in the

past.  



Asked for refill of sublingual nitroglycerin.  Prescription apparently was given to her

last spring.  Complains also of upper chest wall tenderness.  No clear to me what

causes her to take the sublingual nitroglycerine, but says when she takes it, it relieves

her symptoms.  I have asked her if this pain is ever exertional, or is the same pain

that is reproducible when she touches her chest.  The patient seems to label her chest

wall pain as the same as pain that she gets with exertion.  



PROBLEMS: As per LMR.



MEDICATIONS: As per LMR.



ALLERGIES: As per LMR.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: WD/WN female in NAD. Blood pressure 150/80.

Pulse 80 and regular.  Weight 152 pounds.  Lungs: Clear bilateral breath sounds. 

COR: RRR. S1 and S2 without murmurs noted.  Extremities: No lower extremity

edema.  Soreness over posterior right upper trapezius.  Full range of motion of

shoulders. No tenderness over AC joints.  Chest wall tenderness over superior aspect

of sternum and its border on left.  No masses or deformity noted.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



(1)  Chest pain: Certainly overdue for a follow-up with her cardiologist, Dr. Hunter

     Mccarthy.  Referral done.  Also referred sublingual nitroglycerin.



(2)  Elevated blood pressure.  Better than last visit, but remains slightly elevated. 

     At last visit, patient was reluctant to start a beta blocker.  Think she may need

     this at future visit.  Will also refer back to her cardiologist.



(3)  Elevated lipids, last checked last year. Several medications that patient appears

     to be sensitive to side effects.  At next visit, will give lab slip to repeat fasting

     profile. Positive checkup.  Would probably benefit from lipid lowering.



(4)  Leg cramps.  Toward end of visit, patient also complained of more than 25

     years of leg cramps.  Unable to take quinine because of allergic reaction. 

     Patient already takes Valium p.r.n. and I am reluctant to start any other

     anxiolytics.  Will check electrolytes and calcium at next visit. 



(5)  History of sciatica.  Patient states in past that she has received steroid injection

     for her lower back pain, which resolved.  Will simply follow with Vioxx, which

     will hopefully help other pains that patient is experiencing.  Also continue with

     her rheumatologist, Dr. Solomon, who has followed her chronic fibromyalgia and

     chronic low back pain.



Return to clinic with me in six to eight weeks. 



ADDENDUM: Patient's referral was receiving by Dr. Vann's office and they tell

me she should be able to get an appointment for 6/95.

NAME:     Upham, Zelda
MRN:      0308696

The patient is here for a scheduled visit, status post hospitalization for emergent
bypass surgery.  She is late for the visit.  She is accompanied by her daughter,
Qazi.  The patient denies chest pain and has done quite well, based on reports
from her rehab stay at the Miller County Hospital.  Currently complaining of
left-sided chest wall pain. No exertional chest pain and no shortness of breath.  Has
an appointment pending with her cardiologist tomorrow.  Also has an appointment
pending with surgeon Dr. Weeks for 12/13/95. Has been compliant with
medications.  

The patient's daughter is concerned that the patient is not eating enough.  Has lost
significant weight since hospitalization.  Patient did agree that she has been watching
what she eats because she did not want to gain much weight.  Explained to her the
importance of proper nutrition and getting back her strength.  

Asked if she can use an OTC pain patch called Salonpas. Says that the chest wall
tenderness is very different from any exertional chest pain that she may have had in
the past.  Would like some relief for this.  Uses it on her knees and finds it helpful
for the arthritic knee pain. 

Emotionally, the patient did admit to feeling depressed and did become tearful
during the visit. 

PROBLEMS: See extensive LMR list. 

MEDICATIONS:  See LMR list. 

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa, Percocet and quinine. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Well-appearing female. Vital signs: WNL, as per flow
sheet. Lungs: Clear with rales. COR: RRR, S1 and S2 without murmurs noted. 

ASSESSMENT:

(1)  CAD: The patient is also on a cholesterol-lowering agent, but will update list
     at next visit.  Keep appointment with cardiologist. 

(2)  Chest wall tenderness status post CABG: Tried to encourage patient that there
     will be some persistent discomfort in her wound for several months.  Told her
     to hold off on using the OTC pain patch until I can verify the ingredients. 

(3)  Depressed mood status post surgery: Refuses referral to Mental Health. Not
     suicidal. Encouraged patient to eat more regularly. 

(4)  Return to clinic for follow-up in two weeks.  

This visit lasted for 35 minutes, half of which was spent trying to counsel the patient
to obtain proper nutrition and to go to Mental Health.  I was unsuccessful in
convincing her to attend a Mental Health session.

73 yr old woman with HTN, SP CABG, fibromyalgia comes in for follow up of renal MRA done for evaluation of renal insufficiency and associated high K.

She was hospitalized in 7/97 for a fairly acute deterioration of renal function and hyperkalemia.  At that time she was told to DC Lisinopril and Vioxx.  Her renal function seemed to improve with that intervention though in early August her K+ rose a bit.  The VNA has been seeing her at home.  According to the patient her BP has been ""normal"".

She and her daughter come in now to review results of the recent renal MRA.  They are seeing me because there  were no appts available for her with her PCP.  

She denies any chest pain, shortness of breath.  Appetite is good.

She has been trying to avoid foods high in potassium but she is not sure about K+ content of many foods.

She has been taking Lisinopril at the same dose since her CBG in 2095 and has been taking NSAIDs for fibromyalgia for several years.

A:  73 yr old with HTN has had deterioration of renal function since 2095 when she began taking ACEi concomitantly with NSAID.  The cause for more acute deterioration of renal function in 7/2097 and again in early August is unclear.

She has not been taking any NSAID including OTC forms. 

I don't think the moderate renal artery stenosis is a significant contributor to renal dysfunction and her BP is reasonable off the ACEi.  



P:  Her daughter had many questions about what this type of ""blockage"" means and about prognosis.  

I attempted to explain the differences between renal perfusion, renal function, and to advise her about the role/impact of ACEi for BP and her heart (her daughter is worried that her heart will suffer if she doesn't take the ACEi).  

I told her that it is unsafe for her to take any NSAID. 

I suggested that a renal specialist would be helpful in determining the role of renal artery disease in her renal dysfunction.

Provided her with detailed lists of low and high K+ foods.

Check lytes, renal function, Phos, Ca and Alb today.

Dear Dr. Easterling: 

I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Brian Martin in the Cardiology Service on 10/28/2078. He has a history of chest pain and was evaluated at Klickitat Valley Hospital for the same by you and, I believe, Dr. Inglis. He reportedly had an echo and a treadmill test that were unconcerning. 

His episodes of chest pain are interesting. He feels a sharp pain for maybe a second or two in his chest followed by rapid palpitations associated with some jaw aching. The palpitations are of sudden onset as well as sudden offset. They were occurring up to one time per day through his hospitalization at Klickitat Valley a couple of weeks ago and now have occurred on two occasions since discharge. He is otherwise in fairly good health.


	Past medical history:
   1) Nonalcoholic steatotic hepatosis 
2) Palpitations 
3) Rotator cuff surgery in 2071

	

	Allergies:
	
No known drug allergy


	Medications (Confirmed):

	
aspirin  81 mg po daily
penicillin VK  500 mg po 4 x day


	Family history:
   Mother died at age 62 of a heart attack. He has four siblings, all in good health. 


	Social history:
   He is married with two sons, age 21 and 18, both of whom are in good health. He works as an Revenue Officer for Springfield Armory Inc in Picture Rocks, Maine.

Habits: He has never used street drugs. He does not smoke tobacco. He drinks 6 beers/alcohol per week and 2 cups of coffee per day.


	Review of systems:
   Negative in detail as detailed on his questionnaire and confirmed during the office visit.

Physical examination:
	
-BP: 110/70  
-Pulse: 59  BPM regular
-resp. rate: 16  unlabored
-Skin:   without lesions or nodules.
-HEENT:   EOMI.  PERRLA.  Sclerae are anicteric.  Conjunctivae noninjected.  Mucous membranes moist.  No oropharyngeal lesions.
-Neck:   carotids 2+ without bruits; jugular venous pressure &lt;5 cm of water; thyroid without nodules; trachea midline.
-Chest:   lungs clear to auscultation, resonant to percussion, and symmetric in expansion.
-Cardiac:   regular with a normal S1/S2; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
-Abdomen:   soft, nontender, without organomegaly or other masses.
-Extremities:   no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
-Neuro:   reflexes were 1+; cranial nerves 2-12 were intact; motor and sensory modalities were intact in all four extremities.


	EKG:
   10/28/2078: Sinus bradycardia. Otherwise the tracing is within normal limits.


	Assessment and plan:
   Mr. Martin has episodic palpitations associated with some chest discomfort. Sometimes it is difficult for patients to distinguish between palpitations and chest pain per se. It may also be that his palpitations raise his heart rate to the point where he becomes ischemic, notwithstanding the negative stress test that he had in the past. 

We will request the records of the echo and the stress test so we can have them for our files here and I have asked him to complete a 30-day event recording and follow up with me after that has been completed. 

I will certainly keep you informed about how things progress. 

Yours truly, 

Norman C. Ivers, M.D.

Dear Dr. Easterling: 

We had the pleasure of seeing Brian Martin in the Cardiology Service for follow up of rapid heart action. At his last visit we gave him a 30-day loop event recorder for arrhythmia surveillance due to palpitations. Since that point he has transmitted events showing rapid atrial fibrillation up to 160 Bpm associated with chest discomfort, jaw pain and chest thumping. These episodes occur on a random basis and last up to 45 minutes. He does not identify any precipitating factors and symptoms resolve spontaneously. He denies dyspnea, PND, orthopnea, lightheadedness, pre syncope or syncope. He reportedly has had a negative stress test and echocardiogram. He is not on any medications. He has never been on Coumadin.

	Assessment and plan:
   Mr. Martin is a 52-year-old male with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. We have discussed the physiology of the electrical conduction system and the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation. We have discussed treatment options including rate control, rhythm control or pulmonary vein isolation. We have scheduled him for nuclear stress test to R/O ischemia given his symptoms of chest discomfort and new onset of atrial fibrillation and will send him for echocardiogram to R/O structural heart disease. 

We have had a long discussion regarding Cryo Ablation and if his diagnostic testing is within normal limits he would like to possibly consider this as an option for treatment. We have started him on Toprol XL 50 mg daily. If his diagnostic testing is within normal limits we will proceed initially with starting Class IC antiarrhythmic for the treatment of his atrial fibrillation. We will continue a discussion regarding Cryo Ablation and continue medical management. He has a CHAD2 Score of 0. We will therefore recommend treating with Aspirin 325 mg daily for prophylactic embolic protection and would not recommend coumadin at this time. 

We will complete diagnostic testing, follow up with the results and then proceed. We have encouraged him to call with any questions, concerns, or changes in health status. Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions in regard to his care.

Roger Easterling, M.D. 
27 Caroll St, #734 
Bluefield, ME 12111 

Dear Dr. Easterling: 

We had the pleasure of seeing Brian Martin in the Cardiology Service for follow up of atrial fibrillation to discuss findings on recent SESTA MIBI. As you know, he is a 52-year-old male with recent history of palpitations discovered to be atrial fibrillation. Episodes have been associated with chest discomfort, jaw pain and chest thumping and we therefore had him complete nuclear stress test and echocardiogram to R/O structural heart disease. He is on Toprol XL 50 mg and aspirin. SESTA MIBI completed January 5, 2079 after 11 minutes, 13 METS and 90 MPHR was positive ischemia by ECG demonstrated by 2 mm ST depressions in leads II, AVF, and V6 and 2.5 mm ST depressions in leads III and V5. Myocardial scans showed mild anteroseptal and apical ischemia with EF 66%. He had no symptoms and there were occasional VPCs and PACs. Echocardiogram was normal with exception to mildly dilated LA 40 mm. 

Since his last visit he has had two additional of episodes of atrial fibrillation with complaint of rapid heart action, jaw pain and chest discomfort. The episodes lasted approximately 10 minutes and were relieved by rest. He denied lightheadedness, dizziness, pre syncope, syncope, nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis. Of note they occurred this time with exercise as opposed to at rest and they seemed more severe in nature.

	Other Data:
   1. SESTA-MIBI January 5, 2079. Conclusions: 11min, 13 METS, peak HR 151 90% MPHR. Excellent exercise capacity. ECG is positive for ischemia, myocardial perfusion scans show mild anteroseptal and apical ischemia. LVEF 66%. 

2. Echocardiogram December 23, 2078. Conclusions: No MVP. LA dilated 40 mm. Aortic valve is tricuspid, no AI. LV cavity size and systolic function is within normal limits without evidence of segmental wall motion abnormalities and EF 76%. Right atrial dilatation. Normal RV. LA 40 mm, LVIDd 50 mm, LVIDs 29 mm, PWT 10 mm, IVS 10 mm and LVEF 76%. 


	Assessment and plan:
   Mr. Martin is a 52-year-old male with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and ischemia noted on recent SESTA MIBI. We have discussed the findings and have recommended proceeding with cardiac catheterization with potential coronary intervention. We have reviewed pre procedural expectations and procedural risk including femoral vascular complications, cardiac perforation, renal complications, stroke, heart attack, and death. He understands and has agreed to proceed. We have also discussed treatment options for atrial fibrillation. He continues to be interested in CRYO Ablation. We have had a long discussion in this regard. We will have to start medication therapy first and then proceed accordingly. His medication options are now limited due to ischemia.  Sotalol is the best option at this time. 

We have spoken to Dr. Nagle who has agreed to complete his catheterization on January 24, 2079. If the dye load is minimal we may decide to complete in patient Sotalol load. We will assess after his angiogram. We have completed pre procedure blood work, CXR and urinalysis. 

We have encouraged him to call with any questions, concerns or changes in health status. Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions in regard to his care.

Seen with Dr. Person.  

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, REVIEW OF 

SYSTEMS, MEDICATIONS, ALLERGIES:  Were reviewed and confirmed.  

Please see Resident note for further details.  

HISTORY:  I interviewed and examined the patient myself.  The 

history briefly is as follows.  This is a 51 year-old male who was 

recently discharged from the hospital here after a successful 

percutaneous lithotripsy and nephrostomy placement.  He presented 

this evening for a leakage from his nephrostomy tube which he 

believes may have become dislodged or had its cap removed when he 

was sitting on the sofa and got up.  He has been leaking 

serosanguineous fluid since earlier today.  He has no fever, 

chills.  No other complaints.  

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes diabetes, hypertension, CAD, high 

cholesterol.  

MEDICATIONS:  He takes hydrochlorothiazide, Zestril, Calan, Zocor 

and Levaquin.   

ALLERGIES:  He has no allergies to medications.  

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise negative.  

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his family.  

FAMILY HISTORY:  He has no significant family history.  

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His temperature is 99.2, heart rate 93, 

blood pressure 136/81.  He is an awake and alert male in no acute 

distress.  HEENT - Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Oropharynx clear.  

Neck is supple.  Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally.  

Cardiovascular exam is regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub 

or gallop.  Abdomen is soft, nontender.  Mildly obese.  Skin is 

warm and dry.  Left flank is with some resolving ecchymosis.  No 

obvious subcutaneous fluid, and the area around the nephrostomy 

drain is intact.  His gurney linens are soaked with serosanguineous 

fluid.  Extremities without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  

Neurologically alert and oriented.  Cranial nerves II-XII are 

intact.  No motor or sensory deficits.   

CONSULTATIONS:  He is seen in consultation by the Urology Service 

and his tubing was cut back and cap replaced.  It is unclear as 

this was placed by Radiology exactly the exact 

configuration of the tubing.  However, it appears to have ceased 

leak at this time.  

DISPOSITION:  He is discharged in satisfactory condition with 

instructions to return for return of symptoms or for any other 

concerns, and to call to have follow up arranged for early next 

week.

transfer from Friends Hospital for evaluation of progressively

worsening shortness of breath over the last 2 days, associated

with increased fatigue and episodes of chest pressure yesterday. 

He did note increase weight for the last 1-2 months,

progressively worsening shortness of breath with minimal

exertion.  He did have chest pressure at rest yesterday, which

did radiate to his left shoulder.  This seemed to resolve

spontaneously and then he noted shortness of breath with any kind

of exertion at all.  The shortness of breath was exclusively

exertional.  He has not noticed nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis,

presyncopal symptoms or diarrhea.  No fevers.  He does have a

slight cough that is nonproductive.  He was seen at a local

Emergency Department today where he had laboratory studies as

well as was given Lasix, albuterol, and nitroglycerin and states

he has some relief of his symptoms associated with this.  He was

cardioverted 2 days ago for atrial fibrillation by his

cardiologist at SAH.  Additionally, at the outside Emergency

Department, his INR was therapeutic at 2 as he is on Coumadin,

but his troponin was elevated at 0.16.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, orally

controlled diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and atrial flutter. 

He has had a cardiac catheterization last in 2127.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a past smoker with 10 pack years of

smoking.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted in the written chart and HPI,

otherwise negative.

MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin, citalopram, metoprolol, lisinopril,

glipizide, Cipro, and simvastatin.

ALLERGIES:  He is allergic to penicillin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99, pulse 63, respiratory rate

20, blood pressure 140/86, and oxygen saturation 96% on room air.

 HEENT:  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Pleasant, calm.  Neck is

supple.  Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation, except for

scattered rales in the left lower lung field.  Cardiovascular: 

Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.  Abdomen is soft and

nontender.  Skin is intact, warm, and dry.  Extremities:  He has

got 1+ edema of the bilateral lower extremities that is

symmetric.  Neuropsych:  He is oriented x3, moves all extremities

equally.

LABORATORY DATA:  ECG shows a sinus rhythm at 65 with poor R-wave

progression, but no acute ST segment abnormalities.  Chest x-ray

shows interstitial increased markings with a small left pleural

effusion and prominence of the ventricle consistent with mild

pulmonary edema.  Cardiac biomarkers show troponin of 0.16 with

creatinine of 1.43, CK-MB of 3.2 with normal index, and CK of 87.

 BNP is still pending.  INR is 2.5, which is therapeutic on

Coumadin.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  At the outside Emergency

Department, he did receive Lasix and he put off approximately 2

liters of urine since then with significant symptomatic

improvement in his dyspnea.  He has no further episodes of chest

pain or pressure.  I did discuss the case with Dr. Davison,

the SAH cardiologist on-call.  I believe this patient has CHF

exacerbation.  He also was recently cardioverted, which ____

explain his troponin elevation.  Additionally, his CHF

exacerbation alone could explain his troponin elevation, and I

doubt the patient has an acute coronary syndrome.  At this point,

the patient is already anticoagulated by virtue of being on

Coumadin.  We will hold any further heparinization or Lovenox at

this time.  However, he will have serial cardiac biomarkers, will

be admitted to the Cardiology Service for evaluation and for

further evaluation and optimization of his congestive heart

failure and for monitoring of his troponin levels.

DIAGNOSIS:  Congestive heart failure exacerbation, troponin

elevation, and diabetes.

DISPOSITION:  Admission in stable condition.

ID/CC: 60 yo F w/FH scleroderma, personal hx of fibromyalgia, Raynaud's phenomena, GERD, HTN and bronchiectasis p/w diffuse arthralgias, myalgia



HPI: This is a 60 yo F w/a hx of fibromyalgia, Raynaud's, GERD, HTN, bronchiectasis and recurrent PNA who developed severe pain, swelling and stiffness in the MCP joints of both hands 2 nights ago. She says there was initially some redness, no warmth in these joints. She could not open or close her hands. She says the pain migrated to involve all of the joints in her hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders and knees. She noticed swelling in her R knee, no swelling or redness in other joints. Her muscles are diffusely tender. She recalls similar muscle discomfort in prior episodes attributed to fibromyalgia, although not as severe. She also remembers shoulder and elbow pain of similar but less intense character in 2128 while taking rifampin/cipro/azithro for MAC. These symptoms resolved when drugs were stopped. She denies recent fevers or chills. She completed an 8 day course of augmentin for MSSA PNA two days ago. Symptomatically she feels her PNA has resolved and she is at her baseline from a respiratory standpoint w/stable cough and SOB. She does report some mild L-sided pleuritic CP since yesterday. She denies weight loss, skin changes, rash, change in BMs, N/V, dry mouth, change in vision, weakness, paresthesias. ROS + for brittle nails, eye dryness not bothersome. FH notable for mother w/scleroderma.



Her symptoms did not respond to Excedrin and she presented to the ER 11/12. Exam notable for BP 212/93, HR 125, T 98, SO2 98%,    tenderness w/movement in UE's, R knee   . WBC 11.7, HCT 39.8, PLT 421, chem. 10 wnl, CXR w/stable bibasilar lung nodularity. She was admitted to Internal Medicine for further evaluation.

Impr:	60 yo F w/longstanding fibromyalgia and bronchiectasis s/p recent MSSA PNA p/w diffuse arthralgias, myalgias and pleuritic CP. The constellation of myalgias, arthralgias/synovitis, ?pleurisy, Raynaud's, GERD, HTN and +FH invoke the possibility of scleroderma. Rarely, a variant of this disease can present without skin manifestations (systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma). The transient nature of her joint symptomatology is c/w possible crystal disease. The bilateral hand distribution is typical, but progression to involve other joints such as the knee is not. Postviral arthralgias/myalgias is another consideration given the quick resolution of the process. Her myalgias may well represent underlying fibromyalgia. We recommend

  	If available, past ANA, RF, ESR

  	Please check ANA, RF, parvovirus IgM and IgG, uric acid level, U/A

  	Plain films of bilateral hands, R knee

Thank you for this interesting consult. We will follow with you.

    NORMAL FLORA PRESENT



A/P: 61 yr old female with likely bacterial respiratory infection in the setting of longstanding bronchiectasis. She has failed a recent course of Telithromycin in the setting of moraxella culture positive sputum. We will repeat sputum cultures and start vancomycin and ceftriaxone IV here. We will get Chest Films and supplement her home pulmonary regimen with Nebulized albuterol q 4 hrs.  I have encouraged frequent ambulation. She will continue to use her home flutter valve. Her husband provides Chest PT at home and we may order this if appropriate in house.



We will continue her home Inderal at 240 mg qd. This will be supplemented with an ACE I and hydralazine as necessary. The use of an ACE I will be discussed with her PCP as this may have been avoided second to chronic cough. She is not a candidate for Lasix or HCTZ due to her sulfa allergy. Her admission BP of 187/97 was in the setting of a delay in today's dose of inderal. She was asymptomatic with this high pressure. 



We will continue her hormone replacement, GERD prophylaxis with nexium and nightly nortryptiline.  She will be ambulatory and not require DVT prophylaxis.

Date of Admission: 3/30/36

Attending: Dr. Zehr

Admitting Resident: Patricia Nunn

Source of history:  records and pt



ID/CC:	62 yo F w/ hx of bronchiectasis s/p lobectomy, chronic MAC, HTN, fibromyalgia, and raynaud   s presented to OSH w/ chest pain, transferred to PCH w/NSTEMI and DVTs.



HPI: Pt at baseline occasionally gets SOB from her bronchiectasis if she has not had chest PT recently but otherwise is able to walk up multiple flights of stairs without SOB.  She has no known cardiac hx but does have HTN and + fam hx of early CAD.  Pt awoke this morning in her USOH but quickly had sudden onset of 10/10 sharp SSCP radiating to her right arm associated w/ right arm numbness.  Pain is slightly better w/ sitting up though pt denies pleuritic quality.  She then had a vasovagal attack, which she has had before in the setting of pain, and she started to feel lightheaded, nauseated, and diaphoretic.  She laid down on the floor and elevated her legs above her head which helped a little.  Her husband gave her Excedrin w/o improvement and called 911.  EMS gave her 3 puffs of NTG and 4 baby ASA w/o effect.  The ambulance brought her to the closest hospital, Colorow.  In the ED, she was found to be hypertensive w/ SBP 180s, for which she was started on TNG gtt.  She also underwent PE CT which per report was neg for PE but showed bilat DVTs, and she was started on heparin.  She was given fioricet, zofran, and fentanyl for her CP w/ relief.  She was then given a dose of IV lopressor and also had one episode of N/V.  Her labs were significant for + cardiac markers: 1st set w/ CK/MB/index 39/0.9/2.3, trop I 0.03, 2nd 443/57.3/12.9, trop 2.22, 3rd set 686/87.3/12.7, trop 4.18.  EKGs showed right-bundle morphology (though QRS not wide) w/ initial TWI V1-V3 which progressed to deepening TWI V1-V4 and some downsloping STD V3-V4.  Pt is currently chest pain free, no SOB, no palpitations.  She denies any preceding viral illness or any surprises or acute stressors in her life, though she has many chronic medical problems.

PE CT (reviewed w/ ED rads here): no PE to the level of subsegmental arteries, no dissection, no pericardial effusion or bowing of interventricular septum to suggest RV strain, lung parenchyma w/ scattered nodules, largest 6.5 mm, bilat fem veins w/ filling defects

Impression:   62 yo F w/ hx of bronchiectasis s/p lobectomy, chronic MAC, HTN, fibromyalgia, and raynaud   s presented to OSH w/ chest pain, transferred to PCH w/ NSTEMI and DVTs, now chest pain free.  Possible etiologies for her chest pain w/ + cardiac markers include ACS, PE, myopericarditis, spasm, or apical ballooning syndrome.  Dissection less likely w/ equal pulses and not seen on PE CT.  Her EKG changes suggest an element of RV strain, though this is not borne out on TTE, and review of her OSH CT w/ radiology here did not reveal PEs (at least to the level of subsegmental arteries).  Her TTE did not show WMA, and her story could be c/w ACS or c/w myopericarditis or apical ballooning syndrome (esp w/ hx of fibromyalgia, raynaud   s, migraines, etc), though w/ + cardiac enzymes and dynamic EKG changes, need to have low threshold to cath if develops pain.

	Past medical history:
   1. CAD, s/p NSTEMI in March, 2136 with BM stent placement to LCx and RCA
Coronary angiogram in July, 2136:

RE:  Francis, Lydia
PAH#:     981-82-02

SUBJECTIVE: Lydia has been doing well since her right total
hip arthroplasty in January of 2089.  She still has pain in
the right hip and the left hip, which is likely due to
osteoarthritis.  She has been taking Percocet for pain
control.  Fortunately, she is not having problems with
constipation, as she is taking a stool softener.  She is
taking calcitonin and Evista for her osteoporosis.  In
addition, she has had a history of right tibial
osteomyelitis and is taking prophylactic Levaquin, without
evidence of GI upset or antibiotic-associated diarrhea.  She
is taking Cozaar for her blood pressure control, and is also
taking Neurontin for pain control.  At home, she is wearing
a firm brace that Dr. Younce has prescribed.  In addition,
she is using a walker for ambulation when outside the house
and a cane when inside the house.  She comes today for her
appointment with her son.  She arrived in a wheelchair.

On examination, her blood pressure today is 138/80 with a
pulse of 80 and a respiratory rate of 16.  She is afebrile.
Cardiac exam is a regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, without
murmurs.  Her neck is supple, although she does have
paracervical pain to palpation.  Her lungs are clear to
auscultation.  She has pain throughout the paraspinal
muscles in the thoracic and lumbosacral area.  She has some
pain with flexion at the hip, with limited motion at both
hips.  She has no evidence of lower extremity erythema or

ADMISSION DATE: 07/01/2095               DISCHARGE DATE: 07/08/2095
     
     
     
     PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:  Chest wall pain.
     
     ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES: History of diverticulitis abscess, status post
     percutaneous drainage on 01/18/2095 with a colocutaneous fistula;
     hypertension; fibromyalgia; gastroesophageal reflux disease and esophageal
     motility disorder; history of right tibial osteomyelitis in 2086; history
     of osteoarthritis, status post right and left total hip arthroplasty in
     2088 and 2089; varicose veins with a history of chronic venous
     insufficiency ulcers in the past; status post esophageal dilatation,
     12/2093; atypical chest pain.
     
     PROCEDURES: Surgical consultation with Dr. Yonathan Orth; interventional
     radiation radiology consultation; adenosine sestamibi stress test;
     pulmonary embolus CT of the chest; abdominal CT scan.
     
     HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old woman who is a
     Broadcasting and Performing Arts Manager who had been in the McDonough County Nursing Home until the day
     of admission when she woke up with right-sided and epigastric chest
     discomfort associated with shortness of breath that was associated with a
     feeling of warmth rising from her upper abdomen up to her face.  She
     described no radiation discomfort to her left arm, no diaphoresis.  She has
     had these episodes in the past.  She was noted to be hypertensive at the
     McDonough County Nursing Home, up to 200/130, and was given metoprolol 50 mg and
     multiple sublingual nitroglycerins.  She was sent to Pan American Hospital
     for further evaluation. In the emergency room, she received 3
     nitroglycerins, Tylenol and morphine which helped relieved her pain.
     
     PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for the above, plus ischemic colitis. In
     addition, she is debilitated and has lost a significant amount of weight,
     approximately 40 to 50 pounds since January.  She also has asymptomatic
     gallstones.
     
     MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 325 mg daily, Epogen 400 units subcu 3
     times a week, mirtazapine 15 mg at bedtime, megestrol acetate 200 mg daily
     until 07/15/2095, Colace 100 mg b.i.d. p.r.n. constipation, zinc 1 p.o.
     daily, multivitamins 1 p.o. daily, Prilosec 20 mg p.o. daily, metoprolol 50
     mg b.i.d., methadone 5 mg b.i.d., isosorbide 20 mg t.i.d., ferrous sulfate
     325 mg p.o., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily, lactulose p.r.n. constipation,
     Dulcolax p.r.n. constipation, oxycodone 5 mg q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain.
     
     ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.
     
     PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She weighed 88.7 pounds, pulse 68 and regular,
     respiratory rate 20 and unlabored, room-air oxygen saturation was 97%,
     blood pressure was 160/90.  General appearance: Cachectic, elderly woman
     who was in no acute distress.  HEENT: Mucous membranes were dry, pinpoint
     pupils that were minimally reactive, extraocular motions were intact,
     oropharynx without erythema.  JVP 4 cm supine.  There was no
     lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly.  Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, S1-S2.
     There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.  Chest:
     Clear to auscultation.  Abdomen: There was an IR drain in place in the left
     lower quadrant without external drainage.  The abdomen was soft with mild
     tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant without rebound or
     guarding; bowel sounds are present throughout.  Extremities reveal no
     edema.  There were chronic venous stasis changes bilaterally and ecchymosis
     on the left side of her foot.  Pulses were 2+ and symmetric.
     
     Neurological exam: The patient has significant weakness of the bilateral
     lower and upper extremities with -4/5 strength of the hands and 2+ strength
     in the hip flexors, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, calf, and anterior
     tibialis.
     
     LABORATORY DATA: On admission, white count 7700, hematocrit 30.3, platelets
     443,000.  INR 1.4, potassium 4.0, creatinine 0.8, CPK and troponin were
     negative x3.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm without changes of ischemia.
     Chest x-ray revealed no congestive heart failure or pneumonia.  Her
     adenosine sestamibi stress test revealed no evidence of EKG or reversible
     perfusion defects.  She did have evidence of a fixed defect in the inferior
     heart with hypokinesis, with an LVEF of 75%.  CT of chest with a PE
     protocol did not reveal any thrombus.
     
     HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Yonathan Orth
     of general surgery.  The patient had expressed an interest in considering
     colectomy after initially refusing colectomy since January 2095.
     Initially, this was due to concerns about possible transfusion needs during
     surgery.  After extensive
     conversations with Dr. Orth and with her family, and with the patient,
     I believe that the comorbidities associated with the surgery and
     perioperative healing, far outweigh any potential benefits that she may
     have from this potential surgery and therefore we collectively decided not
     to pursue this.
     
     Chest pain: The patient had no evidence of ischemia by cardiac biomarkers.
     Adenosine sestamibi did not reveal any reversible defects.  She will
     continue to be treated with antihypertensives.  Her chest wall pain is
     likely due to esophageal spasm.
     
     Gastrointestinal: Her esophageal spasms and GERD will be treated with PPI.
     
     Chronic pain syndrome: She has chronic pain from osteoarthritis and
     fibromyalgia.  This has led to debilitating weakness in upper or lower
     extremities and reliance upon chronic pain medications. At the time, we
     will continue pain medications for her comfort.  Continue aggressive bowel
     regimen.
     
     Feeding: The patient needs a soft mechanical diet in order to allow her to
     eat and masticate as she has no dentures at present.  The family currently
     working to try to obtain dentures for her.
     
     Resuscitation status: Per the patient's wishes, after extensive
     conversation with family and patient, she does not desire heroic
     intervention and is DO NOT RESUSCITATE AND DO NOT INTUBATE.
     
     DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Prilosec 20 mg p.o. daily, Tylenol 650 mg p.o.
     p.r.n., vitamin C 500 mg p.o. daily, aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily, Colace 100
     mg b.i.d., Epogen 4000 units 3 times a week, ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o.
     daily, isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg p.o. t.i.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily,
     milk of magnesia daily p.r.n. constipation, megestrol acetate suspension
     200 mg p.o. daily to terminate on 07/15/2095, metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
     mirtazapine 15 mg p.o. at bedtime, multivitamins 1 p.o. daily, oxycodone
     p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain, Zocor 20 mg p.o. daily, zinc sulfate 220 mg p.o.
     daily, methadone 2.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
     
     DISPOSITION: The patient will be transferred back to the McDonough County Rehabilitation Center.

Re:	Horn, Gregory

	BCC Unit #: 977-82-23



Dear Dr. Givens:



I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Horn, in follow-up regarding possible interstitial lung disease. 



He has managed to lose 3 lbs. on his own personal diet plan, and feels his diabetes is coming under slightly better control.



His cough is virtually gone and now has only rare cough with a little bit of phlegm, grading it as 2 out of 10 vs. 8-9 out of 10, to which his wife agrees.  They both attribute it to the Prilosec.



He now sleeps well and does not use his wedge.  He has no snoring, daytime hypersomnolence, or morning headaches - no longer falls asleep at work.



Allergies and nasal congestion are not evident.



No lower extremity edema, swollen glands, or fevers.



Mildly less prominent exertional breathlessness - He now occasionally has to go up one flight of stairs without stopping.



On examination, he is well appearing.  Respiratory rate 22 and unlabored. Blood pressure 90/50 with a small cuff. Conjunctivae are clear.  Oropharynx is clear. Trachea is midline, no goiter or adenopathy. Back:  Normal configuration.  Chest:  Normal percussion note, good air movement bilaterally; fine expiratory crackles at the lateral bases.  Cardiac:  Faint left parasternal impulse, mildly prominent P2, normal S1, S2, without murmur, rub, or gallop.  JVP is 7 cm with borderline HJR.  Abdomen: Soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass. Extremities:  No cyanosis or edema, borderline clubbing.



Pulmonary function tests today show very stable values per spirometry, a slight down-   ..  in total lung capacity, but still approximately 70% predicted, and DLCO stable in the 60% predicted range.



My review of CT scan of the chest shows faint peripheral subpleural reticular pattern with cyst formation and no significant nodules.  



Impression:



1.	Interstitial lung disease - Mild objective impairment by functional status.  Pulmonary function tests - Overall, these were stable, and the CT scan is quite suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis.  However, as I reviewed with the patient and his wife, it is well established that 10% of the time, another disorder, such as occult hypersensitivity pneumonitis or nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis can be found on lung biopsy.  There is no evidence of a rheumatologic disorder nor any evidence of chronic aspiration, other than that associated with GE reflux, to explain his lung disease.  He would be a very reasonable candidate for gamma interferon, although this likely would necessitate low-dose steroids - the latter treatment would certainly have an impact on his diabetes.



2.	GE reflux - This is the main source of his cough and is well established to be associated with pulmonary fibrosis.  If he is able to lose weight and change his lifestyle, he can have very good control of this.



3.	Possible mild pulmonary hypertension related to the pulmonary fibrosis.



4.	Possible sleep disorder - Currently is entirely without symptoms, now that his reflux is well controlled.



5.	Chronic cough.



6.	Diabetes - Better controlled.



7.	Obesity - He continues to need aggressive weight loss program.  As I mentioned to him, he would not be a candidate for lung transplantation evaluation while he is at such as weight, but he is starting to make some progress.



Recommendations:



1.	Continue proton pump inhibitor at b.i.d. dosing, as well as lifestyle modifications, including marked decrease in caffeine intake.



2.	Referral to Dr. Harry Yerger for VATS lung biopsy.



3.	Cardiovascular evaluation by you, prior to his surgery, would be appreciated.



It has been a pleasure to participate in his care.  Please feel free to call with any questions or comments.



Sincerely, 





Paul N. Tam, M.D.

Re:  	Horn, Gregory

      	BCC Unit #: 977-82-23



Dear Dr. Givens:



I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Horn, today in follow-up.  



VATS biopsy on 9/27 showed usual interstitial pneumonitis with extensive smooth muscle metaplasia - a rather unusual reading.  



Since the biopsy, he has recovered well, but is mildly more short of breath than previous. For example, he notes that going up the four stairs to the house with bundles he is mildly short of breath and has to rest.



The cough is slightly increased to 3/10, but is markedly better than on presentation.



He has no leg edema, chest pain, skin rash, joint problems, or fevers.



He has managed to lose 6 lbs. by giving up sweets, and his sugars are slightly better.  



GE reflux is very well controlled.



Medications:  Prilosec 20 mg b.i.d., aspirin, Glyset, Actose, metformin, metoprolol, Lipitor, and Hyzaar.



On Examination:  He is well appearing. Blood pressure 110/60, respiratory rate 20 and unlabored.  Oropharynx is clear.  Conjunctivae are clear. Trachea is midline, no goiter.  Chest:  Normal percussion note, well-healed VATS scar; fine inspiratory crackles 1/3 of the way up bilaterally with coarser crackles over the axilla.  Cardiac:  Normal apex beat, normal P2, no murmur, JVP less than 8 cm with equivocal HJR.  Abdomen:  Obese, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass.  Extremities:  No edema, borderline clubbing, no cyanosis. 



Exercise oximetry:  Saturation at rest 96% and after treadmill ergometry 94%.



Pulmonary function tests today by my review show an FEV1 and FVC that are decreased by approximately 10%, total lung capacity decreased by 1 liter, and DLCO down from 20 to 14.



Weight is 238 lbs. (BMI 38).



Impression:



1.	Biopsy-proven idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - The biopsy reading is somewhat unusual, and I will review this at our Pulmonary group weekly meeting, particularly with an eye to agents that might possibly target to exclude muscle metaplasia.  I continue to think him a relatively high risk candidate for the low-benefit regiment of prednisone, with an immunosuppressant agent.  I think he may be a very good candidate for gamma-interferon, but unfortunately not every one benefits from this.  



I emphasized strongly to he and his wife that his disease may have progressed, or could be made worse by the recent chest surgery and worsened gastroesophageal reflux.  If the disease was, indeed, progressing, we would need to proceed with lung transplantation workup.  The most significant contraindication currently to transplantation is his substantial obesity.  I calculated with him that he needed to have his weight down to 190 lbs. to get to a BMI of 30, and that by the time of listing he needed to have a BMI of approximately 32.  Hence, he has his work cut out for him.



2.	Obesity - As above.



3.	Diabetes.



4.	Possible coronary artery disease - He apparently did fine on his preoperative cardiac workup.



5.	GE reflux - As mentioned.



6.	Cough - Mainly due to GE reflux, and less prominent contribution from the pulmonary fibrosis.



Recommendations:



1.	Add Reglan 10 mg b.i.d.



2.	Continue Prilosec 40 mg b.i.d. - as 20 mg b.i.d. did not give full control with the generic pills.



3.	We will review pathology.



4.	Follow-up visit with full pulmonary function tests in one month.



5.	I strongly urged him to continue a steady, but progressive weight loss program - I expect that his life will depend upon it.  



It has been a pleasure to participate in his care.  Please feel free to call with any comments or questions.  



Sincerely, 





Paul N. Tam, M.D.

November 20, 2093  Endocrine/Diabetes

Present Illness:  
Asked to see this 59 year old man with IPF, diagnosed in 2090, an admission to BCC last month with pneumonia, who presented with rapidly progressive respiratory distress last week and was admitted intubated to the MICU. He as treated with high dose Solumedrol and with antibiotics, and is improving nicely. He is extubated and has begun to eat. 

Diabetes was diagnosed 14 years ago. He was treated with pioglitazone 45 mg qd, metformin 2000 mg in divided doses and a sulfonylurea until February of this year, when the sulfonylurea was replaced with insulin. For convenience with his travel schedule, his insulin has been 70/30 administered by pen, with 30 U before breakfast and 40 U before  supper. He tests his BS before  breakfast and supper only and reports that, since he has been more careful with his diet recently, they have been in the low 100   s and mid 100   s, respectively. His hemoglobin A1c was 7.4 % a month ago.
Retinopathy:	He is due for his yearly appointment with his ophthalmologist. No retinopathy in the past.  
Nephropathy:	BUN/Cr 31/1.3 today. No microalbumin/creatinine ratio in CAS.
Neuropathy:	He has occasional paresthesias in his feet.
Cardiac:	He is s/p stent for coronary artery disease about 8-9 years ago.
Vascular:	No claudication.

His IPF is treated with Mucomyst and gamma interferon, which he administers to himself. 

Past Medical History:  
Surgery:	Coronary stent
	Lung biopsy at time of diagnosis of IPF 
Medical:	Hypertension	
	Hyperlipidemia
	GERD
Allergies:	No known drug allergies.
Smoking History:	No
Alcohol History:	No

Family History:  
There is a significant family history of diabetes, including his mother, maternal grandmother, one of his 5 siblings, and some paternal relatives as well.

Social History: 
Lives with his wife and their adopted son, who is a Recruitment Officer.
Computer and Network Technicians for General Dynamics, covering 8 states. His job entails travel.

Review of Systems: above
Ears: Mild hearing loss. 
Review of systems is otherwise negative.

Physical Exam:	
Very pleasant, ruddy complexioned man in no distress.
BP:   148/78		P:   76, regular	T: 98.0
Wt:   209 by history		Ht: 5    7.5    by history
HEENT:	Anicteric. Full EOM's. 
Fundi:	Not examined.
Carotids:	Normal pulses, without bruits
Thyroid:	Not palpable
Chest:	Few rales anteriorly, L>R.
Heart:	Normal S1; physiologic S2.  No gallops.  No murmurs
Abdomen:	No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses. No tenderness. No palpable AAA. 
Extremities:	No edema.  DP 2+ R, absent L. PT 2+,=.  Good foot care.
Neurological:	AJ 1+,=, with normal relaxation. 

Impressions and Plan:	
59 year old man with type 2 diabetes now on steroids for IPF flare, currently down to 125 mg q12h, given at noon and MN.
Having reviewed his recent data, would suggest that we change his current insulin to:
NPH 40 / Regular 10+ scale qAM before  breakfast
Regular 10+ scale qPM before  supper
NPH 30 at bedtime
QID Regular sliding scale
These initial doses will need to be adjusted based on experience and on any changes in the steroid doses.
I have no objection to resuming his pioglitazone, or substituting rosiglitazone while he is here, as long as you do not feel that volume overload is playing any role in his deterioration.
I would prefer not to resume the metformin while is at risk for acute respiratory deterioration with risk of acidosis.
Would change the steroid dosing to 8AM, 8 PM, hoping that we can also start to reduce the doses, PM first, if possible.
He appears to have an anemia that has at least a component of iron deficiency. If you agree, would start iron repletion. (Note that in addition to the iron studies, his MCV, though still normal, has come down over time.)

Thanks.

	Interval History:
   Mr. Horn is a 60 y.o. male w/ h/o idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis s/p single right lung transplant in April 2094 whose post-op course has been complicated by CMV viremia, valcyte-induced myelosuppression and severe deconditioning.  Mr. Horn was most recently admitted from 12/11/94 through 12/30/94 for complaints of severe fatigue and dyspnea, although without symptoms of infection or acute graft rejection. His main complaint was generalized weakness and fatiguability even w/ very minimal activity.  Additionally, he reported a very poor appetite and continued weight loss. 

During that admission, he was transfused to a Hct&gt;30 and his PFTs ultimately returned back to baseline.  His weakness was felt to be primarily related to his malnutrition as he was documented as having an inadequate caloric intake. Nutrition was consulted, a PEG tube was placed and tube feeds were started to supplement his nutrition. He was discharged without incident on 12/30.

The patient continued w/ Nepro boluses and nocturnal TF at home and demonstrated an 8 lb weight gain in less than 2 months. He was improving until blood work revealed a positive CMV antigenemia (7 cells) on 1/29/95.  Transplant ID was consulted and the patient was restarted on Valcyte 450 QOD, and then later bumped up to QD dosing based on ID recommendations. He again experienced myelosuppression and was started on neupogen 300 mcg sc qd on 2/14/95 for a WBC of 0.6. At that time is HCT was 24.8 and PLTs 32K.  

A repeat CBC was obtained today and revealed worsening myelosuppression; Hct 21.6/Hgb 6.9, WBC 0.4 and PLTs 15K.   Case was discussed with Dr. Valerio and the patient was contacted and instructed to present to the BCC ER for further evaluation and treatment.  



	Past medical history:

83 year old woman with history of COPD, HTN, NIDDM who presented with shortness of breath and bilateral pedal edema.  Ms. Etheridge was given lasix with a good response.  Her shortness of breath resolved.  Her EKG was normal and her cardiac enzymes were flat.  It was felt that she had tracheobronchitis with sputum production and consequently treated with azithromycin.  She will continue on her nebulization and steroid taper for her underlying COPD.  Mr. Etheridge was discharged on March 19, 2087

RE:Etheridge, Shari

PMH:94482315

 

July 13, 2087

 

REASON FOR VISIT:  Postoperative appointment.

 

HPI:  Shari is an 83-year-old female who on March 21, 2087 underwent an 

ileocecectomy for ischemic bowel.  Two weeks prior to her presentation 

to the Parkview Memorial Hospital she underwent a stent placement to 

her SMA.  After stent placement she was discharged to rehab, and then 

returned to the emergency room complaining of severe sudden onset of 

right lower quadrant pain.  CT scan of the abdomen showed cecal 

thickening with fat stranding locally.  She subsequently was taken to 

the operating room.  Her postoperative course was uncomplicated and she 

was discharged to Hendry Hospital where she had remained until May.

 

Her complaints today include some constipation, which she is relating 

to iron intake.  She is going to use some stool softeners and some milk 

of magnesia for this.  She also has some diaphoresis at nighttime, 

which she reports has occurred prior to her hospitalization.  

 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Otherwise, today she denies fever, chills, chest 

pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, 

or calf pain.

 

PHYSICAL EXAM: On physical exam she is healthy appearing in no apparent 

distress.  She is accompanied today by her daughter.  Her weight is 164 

pounds.  Her vital signs are 103/80, 70, 16, 96.6.  Her abdomen is 

soft, nontender and nondistended.  Her midline incision is well healed 

with no evidence of hernia.

 

IMPRESSION:  Ischemic cecum.

 

PLAN: Patient was seen today by Dr. Oscar G. Gregory and Quiana N. 

Bullock, NP.  We will send over to her primary care physician the 

operative, pathology, and discharge summaries.  Shari does not need to 

return to clinic unless further surgical issues arise.

Name: Etheridge, Shari 

MR: 2931335

Admitting Cardiologist: Travis

PCP: 



Date of Admission to WGH: January 19th, 2087



ID/CC: 84 year-old woman with CAD, CHF, COPD presents with shortness of breath. 



HPI: (Obtained from patient).  Ms. Etheridge has a history of coronary artery disease, stating that she has a    heart problem.     She is unable to give more details at the present time.  Per old records, she carries the diagnosis of CAD and diastolic heart failure EF 55%.  

	She was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission, when she began to complain of    a cold.     She felt chills, even though it was warm in her house.  That day she suffered a mechanical fall, slipping on a blanket in her home.  She hit her left eye, but denies LOC.  The next day, she was    achy    all over, noted a dry cough, and was    wheezy.     The day prior to admission, she states that she    couldn't breath    and had to come into the ER.

On arrival to WGH at 11:30AM 01/18/88 vitals were: P 93  BP 121/82  RR 22  96% on room air.  She had a prolonged ER course of 31 hours duration.  Initially, she was treated for presumed COPD flare with nebulizers, prednisone and doxycycline.  A rapid flu test was positive for influenza A.  She received 1 liter of normal saline.  Approximately 6 hours later, she complained of 7/10 mid sternal chest pain, non-radiating.  EKG showed: sinus tachycardia @115bpm, with STE 1mm AVR, and STD II, V3-V5.  Her pain came to 1/10 with 2L NTG and Ativan.  Small doses of IV lopressor were given.  STDs partially resolved.  Around 10AM the day of admission  (01/19/88) her blood pressure acutely rose to 190 systolics, her heart rate increased to 106bpm.  Per the patient, she remembers having a coughing fit, and being unable to catch her breath.  She was placed on CPAP, then switched to BiPAP for ABG: 125/78/7.13.  She was felt clinically to be in flash pulmonary edema.  She was treated with nebulizers, intravenous TNG, lasix and BiPAP.  With improvement in hemodynamics, her pain and shortness of breath improved.  Enzymes were drawn and showed: trop 0.22, CK 122, MB 11.7.  She was started on heparin, integrillin (though unclear if she received it).

The patient currently denies pain.  She is extremely anxious, refusing blood draws, etc.

sob



HPI:   	[Per patient, chart]

85F hx CHF, COPD, DM2, HTN, PVD (s/p mult procedures) p/w acute sob this AM. Pt reports she has had a bladder infection off and on for the past several months manifesting as urinary urgency, frequency, dysuria. Went to WGH Pecos clinic 1 wk pta and received fosfamycin. Went back on Tue w no resolution of sx and says med was changed (? to nitrofurantoin per ED pass-off). On Friday AM, woke up with sob. Felt bloated in her stomach and had difficulty w breathing when trying to get dressed. Sob much worse w activity, would resolve w lying down, associated w diaphoresis. Pt denies CP at the time of the episode (reports some subsequent short-lived R-sided CP in WGH ED, similar to R-sided CP she has had    off and on for awhile    wh she did not mention to the ED staff). Denies palpitations, arm or jaw pain. Denies increase in LE edema, no recent change in meds, excellent medication regimen compliance, not a lot of salt in diet, and no recent diet changes. Pt does sleep on mult pillows but says she does this because of her reflux disease. Pt does think she had similar sob 1-2  yrs ago when she was admitted to WGH, told she had CHF, and was diuresed. Because of her symptoms on Friday 12/09/88, pt went into WGH Pecos clinic. Per Pecos note, EKG at that time showed ST depressions in I,aVL, V5, V6, II/III/aVF. Pt received ASA 325 and lasix 40 mg IV, and was sent to WGH ED.



ED Course: On arrival to WGH ED, pt had VS T 98.2, P 74, BP 160/70, RR 24, O2 Sat 95% RA. Pt's EKG was read as showing ST depressions in V4-V6. Pt received NTG sl x 1, lopressor IV 5 mg x1, lopressor 25 mg po x1, and reportedly EKG changes improved w rate control. CXR in ED was clear. BNP was in 1400s (vs 6000-12000 during prior WGH admissions where CHF was diagnosed).



ROS:   No F/C. Some sweats.  No change in weight/appetite. + dry cough. No wheezing.  No N/V/D/hematochezia/melena. No delta MS/LOC. No unilateral weakness.

___________________________________________

Impression:

85F w hx CHF, CAD, COPD in w exertional sob that started on AM of admission. Pt has been undergoing treament for persistent UTI. While sob is likely multifactorial from CHF and COPD, COPD exacerbated by recent illness is most likely etiology.  CHF is argued against by: normal BNP (especially in comparison to elevated BNP in 6000s on prior admission for CHF), clear CXR, clear lung exam, and pt is still having exertional CP similar to what she felt on AM of admission.  If one believes her EKGs demonstrated ischemic changes, this would support an explanation that her sob is an anginal equivalent. However, ST changes appear minimal on close evaluation of EKG changes. Cardiac enzymes are negative so far.



Plan: 

1.	SOB

a.	Cont to cycle cardiac enzymes. Negative so far.

b.	Cont tele

c.	Atrovent and albuterol nebs

d.	Cont home lasix dose for now. Does not appear to be volume overloaded.

e.	Pt has not received stress test which was recommended after most recent WGH admission. Would pursue this now to help sort out whether ? EKG changes are real and indicative of significant ischemic disease. At current level of dyspnea, pt would not be able to do a treadmill test.

f.	PT/OT consults.

2.	UTI

a.	Repeat UCx

b.	Per pt and chart, multiple allergies, though pt is unclear on specific reactions. Will start tetracycline po based on urine culture data from 12/03/88.

3.	DM2

a.	Cont glipizide

NAME:    Vines, Stephen

MRN:     1672569



Mr. Vines comes in today.  He has been feeling pretty well though he is

distressed at his 18-pound weight gain.  His sugars were in the 300s before starting

the insulin.  Since he started the insulin, his sugars have come down nicely.  His

fasting sugars have been in the 120s.  His afternoon sugars have been in the 70-90s. 

He had a few hypoglycemic episodes early on but has not had some in almost a

month.  Other than that, he really has no new complaints.  He is still not smoking. 

He is still on the patch.  His neuropathy has not gotten any worse and he thinks he

can stop the Neurontin now.  He has not had any shortness of breath, cough or

edema.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As above.  No GI symptoms, no GU symptoms and no

new skin symptoms, no arthritic complaints. 



HABITS: Not smoking or drinking.  Not getting much exercise now.



PHYSICAL EXAM: His blood pressure is 140/80 on the left, 150/80 on the right. 

His pulse is 76 and regular.  Respirations are 16.  Lungs are clear. Heart: Regular

rate and rhythm, negative M/R/G.  No bruits heard.  Nasopharynx unremarkable. 

Abdomen is benign.  He has diminished pulses but good capillary refill in the feet. 

The cellulitis on the left ankle is completely resolved.  He has some neuropathy of

the feet with decreased sense to vibration in both feet, but his sensation to

monofilament is intact on both feet. 



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



(1)  Diabetes.  Will check his hemoglobin A1c today.  It may still be a little bit

     high as he has undergone a rather brisk change since starting his insulin.  I

     encouraged him to check his sugars a couple times a week, especially in the

     afternoon.  If he continues to get low sugars, will cut back on his morning

     insulin to 35 units.  He is going to bring in a form for custom shoes given his

     neuropathy and is followed closely by Podiatry.  He had an eye exam earlier

     this year with Dr. Yousif.



(2)  Hypertension.  Will increase his Mavik to 4 mg a day.



(3)  Hyperlipidemia.  Recheck lipids and SGOT today.



(4)  CAD prevention.  He can't take aspirin so we will start Plavix 75 mg a day.



(5)  Status-post splenectomy.  He needs a Pneumovax booster 0.5 cc was given in

     the left deltoid.

NAME:    Vines, Stephen
MRN:      1672569

Stephen comes in today.  He has been feeling pretty well.  Really has no new
complaints.  He still has 5 block claudication in his calves and he continues to smoke 
a half pack per day.  His neuropathy is stabilized and his sugars have been good for
the most part in the 140-150 range on insulin.  His weight has been stable.  He has
had no shortness of breath or chest pain and his review of systems is otherwise
negative.

HABITS: Smokes about a half pack per day.  Does not drink, not really getting much
exercise.  His legs hurt only when he walks over 5 blocks.  It doesn't hurt when he is
working in the McCormick Company.

PHYSICAL EXAM: He looks well.  His blood pressure is 142/80.  His pulse is 74
and regular.  Respirations are 16. Lungs are clear.  No worrisome skin lesions. No
bruits.  1+ carotids.  Abdomen is soft and nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly, no
pulsatile masses, no bruits. Decreased pulses in the feet and decreased capillary refill
and decreased sensation of vibration and fine touch.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  

(1)  Diabetes.  Will check his hemoglobin A1c to see where we stand.  Continue
     on his current regimen.  Encouraged him to increase his exercise and watch his
     diet.  He has an eye exam scheduled.  His feet look okay, though we will have
     to be careful given his neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease.

(2)  Claudication.  Once again, talked to Mr. Vines about the absolute
     importance of quitting smoking.  He is going to try using the Wellbutrin.  Gave
     him a prescription for #60.  He will take one a day for 3-4 days and then go
     up to 1 p.o. b.i.d.  He has no contraindications. I also encouraged him to use
     the patch.  Hopefully, we will be able to get him off the cigarettes.  I also
     encouraged him to walk until it hurts at least 3-4 x a day to try and train his
     legs.

(3)  Hypertension.  Our goal is to get his blood pressure down about 130.  Will
     increase the Mavik to twice a day.

(4)  Hyperlipidemia.  Well controlled on Lipitor.  Recheck his lipids.

(5)  Neuropathy.  Stable.  He doesn't feel the need for any medication for it.

(6)  HPDP.  Will check his guaiac cards.  He is not interested in a sigmoidoscopy. 
     He has had a Pneumovax.  Patient will follow up with me in 3 months.

Reason for visit:

   Angiography for claudication and chronic renal insufficiency



Interval History:

   Mr. Vines is a 70 year old male who has experienced claudication for approximately five to six years.  He describes his claudication as bilateral shin pain which radiates up to his knees.  His symptoms have worsened over the past two to three years and are now limiting his lifestyle.  He is able to walk approximately two to three city blocks when the pain starts and is relieved with rest.  He denies rest symptoms.  He was recently evaluated by Dr. Curtis Cochran for his claudication syjmptoms.  After an extensive conversation and a review of hsi options, Mr. Vines decided to pursue catheter based revascularization.



He underwent adominal aortography and iliofemoral angiography today which demonstrated:

-grossly patent celiac axis, SMA and IMA

-single renal arteries bilaterally with ostial/proximal 65-70% stenosis on the left; the right renal artery has proximal 30% stenosis

-diffuse atherosclerosis of the infrarenal abdominal aorta with 10-20% stenosis

-right common iliac artery diffuse 20-30% stenosis

-right internal iliac artery ostial 70% stenosis

-right external iliac artery patent

-right common femoral artery patent

-right profunda femoris patent

-right SFA with bulky, calcific eccentric 95% stenosis



-left internal iliac ostial 40% stenosis

-left external iliac aratery patent

-left common femoral artery calcific eccentric 70% stenosis

-left profunda femoris patent

-diffuse left SFA 60-70% stenosis in the mid vessel with supraimposed focal 80-90% stenosis

-total occlusion of the left popliteal artery with reconstitution at the TP trunk

-total occlusion of the left anterior tibial artery

-collaterals reconstitute the left peroneal and posterior tibial artery



Mr. Vines underwent dilation of the left femoral artery, dilation of the popliteal occlusion and overlapping Absolute stents to his left SFA.  He arrives to Internal Medicine mildly hypertensive with SBP 140-170s.

Assessment and plan:

   Mr. Vines is a 70 year old male who presents today for angiograpy for lifestyle limiting claudication.  He underwent dilation of his left common femoral artery, dilation of his popliteal occlusion and placement of two overlapping Absolute stents to his left SFA.  There will be further discussion to undergo a staged intervention of his left reanl artery and right SFA calcific lesions as an outpatient.



1.  PVD-Plan to continue current medical regimen.  Plan for Plavix for one month.  Further discussions of his left renal artery and right SFA lesions to be discussed as an outpatient.  Patient would benefit from CNIS due t his bilateral carotid stenoses but may obtain as an outpatient.



2.  CARDIAC

ISCHEMIA-No symptoms.  Continue his current regimen.  His recent lipid panel is at target.  

PUMP-Euvolemic on exam.  Hypertensive on arrival to unit and received additional nitrates.  Will monitor response and consider added Norvasc.  

RATE/RHYTHM-Well controlled on Toprol.



3.  RENAL-Patient received sodium bicarbonate drip for renal protection.  Plan to add mucomyst.  Monitor renal function and urine output.  Continue lisinopril as he as been taking this as an outpatient and tolerating it.



4.  PUD-Continue PPI.



5.  DISPO-Anticipate discharge home in the am and follow-up with Dr. Cochran and his cardiologist Edward Benitez.





Further plans per Dr. Cochran.

currently maintained on furosemide 20 mg. PO q.d., nifedipine XL 90 mg. PO 
q.d., and potassium chloride 10 ml. equivalents PO q.d.  Patient comes in 
today for a routine follow up of her blood pressure, as well as routine 
baseline examinations.  On her last visit, her blood pressure was 160/90, 
and on check today it was 150/90.  We discussed the possibility that she 
continue her salt-restricted diet.  We also discussed that she continue 
her own exercise, both of which she does faithfully, and we also discussed 
the possibility of her trying to gradually lose weight.  She currently 
weighs 199 lbs. and stands approximately 4'9"" tall.  
 
As far as long-term prognosis, my current plan is to evaluate her blood 
pressure on another subsequent visit in the next 6-8 weeks and at that 
time if it is elevated, we will consider either going up on her nifedipine 
XL dose or going up on her furosemide medicine, seeing if we can possibly 
gain some better control or possibly adding another agent.  However, at 
this point she seems to be doing much better with this new blood pressure 
and this is significant improvement maintenance from her previous blood 
pressure on her first admission, which was systolic blood pressures in the 
200s-190s.
 
 
Her family situation which was somewhat unstable at her first presentation 
now appears to be much more stable.  She is currently living with her 
mother and she says that she she is enjoying her new sense of feeling good 
about her self with regard to exercise and maintenance of her diet.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAM:  BP: 150/90   Lungs: clear bilaterally.  Heart: RRR, no 
murmurs.  Abdomen: distended, obese, no evidence of HSM or any focal 
tenderness.  She had good pulses distally with no evidence of trace 
swelling bilaterally at the ankles.   Breast exam: no evidence of masses 
or lumps.
 
She will follow up with me in 6-8 weeks, at which time she will have a 
mammogram performed as well as a Pap smear, cholesterol test, and stool 
guaiacs.  Advance directives were not discussed and it is not a pertinent 
issue at this point.

HPI: Mrs. William-Nuel is a 61-year old patient of mine who carries a 
diagnosis of essential hypertension and comes in today for a routine 
checkup. Patient appears to be doing fine. She has been compliant with her 
antihypertensive regimen, which consists of nifedipine and also 
hydrochlorothiazide. Since our last meeting, the patient has lost 
approximately 15 to 20 pounds. She has been exercising on a daily basis 
and eating very well, both of which have had very, very significant and 
beneficial results on her blood pressure and pressure today on examination 
was 120/80 in both arms. The patient was complaining of some ankle 
swelling, and in looking through her medicines I noted that she had been 
on furosemide, which was a holdover from the time of her most recent 
admission. I quickly switched to furosemide to hydrochlorothiazide, which 
I feel would give her much better diuretic response and relief of her 
symptoms over the next few days. 
 
The final issue with the patient today is low back pain, which she has had 
chronically for the last several years after suffering a fall in 2065. We 
have tried a whole host of conservative measures, which have included bed 
rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and back exercises. The 
patient is referred now to the Paoli Memorial Hospital Spinal Clinic for 
services to obtain further help, and hopefully treatment, of her pain. 
Treatment recommendations from the Spinal Clinic will be forthcoming. 
Patient is scheduled to follow up with me again in two to three months.
 
ADDENDUM: The issue of her annual screening was addressed also and patient 
agreed to have her cholesterol checked today, but does not want to have 
either a mammogram or a Pap smear. She complains that she does not have 
faith in these procedures and that this is something that she is not used 
to and does not want to have done. I attempted to discuss the need and why 
it is necessary to undergo continued screening and will continue to do 
this with the patient in the future, but for now, the patient adamantly 
refuses either of the two examinations.

WESTYN-NUEL,KELLI   898-97-85-6            VISIT DATE: 02/13/79
This patient was seen with Dr. Quilla Uehara, an Emergency 
Medicine resident.  The PRESENTING COMPLAINT, HISTORY OF PRESENTING 
COMPLAINT, PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, MEDICATIONS, ALLERGIES, SOCIAL 
HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, and REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted on the 
record by Dr. Uehara, and as reviewed with the patient and with Dr. 
Uehara.  Briefly, the patient is a pleasant 64-year-old woman, who 
has had episodes of severe left-sided pressure-like chest pain off 
and on through the course of this week.  This has occurred with 
exertion and has always cleared with rest.  She is pain-free at 
present, but presents to the Emergency Department because she 
reported to her family that she had ceased taking her high blood 
pressure medications. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The physical examination is as noted by Dr. 
Uehara.  Basically, the examination is completely normal with the 
exception of the blood pressure, which ranges from 220 to 230 over 
100 to 110.  The patient's electrocardiogram does not show acute 
changes. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The cardiac troponin I is 0.53. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  I concur with Dr. Uehara that the 
patient has a strong history for unstable angina.  The patient will 
be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation.  She has 
remained pain-free while in the Emergency Department and has 
received nitroglycerin paste.  Her blood pressure will be treated 
with initiation of an ACE inhibitor. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Unstable angina. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 
admitted to the hospital in satisfactory condition.

She is tolerating her medications quite well and is happy with her
progress.  At home she takes her blood pressure and it's generally 
around 120/80.
 
Current medications are one aspirin per day as well as Isordil 20
mg. t.i.d., Labetalol 400 mg. t.i.d., Norvasc 7.5 mg. q.d., Lipitor
80 mg. q.d. and Glipizide.  She has not used sublingual
Nitroglycerin although she has this.  
 
Her blood pressure today is 128/80 and her heart rate is 50 and
regular.  Chest is clear. Cardiac exam reveals a II/VI left sternal
border systolic ejection murmur.  Abdomen is soft and nontender. 
Extremities are free of edema.
 
Ms. Kelli Westyn-Nuel is doing well. We will check her LDL
again today to make sure it did not rebound to a higher level
following her myocardial infarction.  We will also check her liver
function test because of her statin therapy.  We may in the future
need to adjust her nitrates to a more rational once per day
regimen, but her current situation is so stable that we will leave
her medications as is.

New Patient Visit







Chief Complaint of:  2nd opinion



History of Present Illness: 74 yo M who comes to the office in search of a second opinion about his care at the Boaz Nursing Home in Lynden. He has a hx of prostate CA diagnosed in 2059 at the BNH and had an RRP shortly thereafter at the BNH. Apparently his pathology showed extraprostatic extension and he received postop XRT. Apparently, he has remained disease free since this time until a PSA was checked this past October which was 3.53. He states that he had not had his PSA checked for a few years before this, admittedly perhaps because he had missed appointments. The Urologists at the BNH have since checked a bone scan and abdominal CT scan, all of which were negative. He has the reports here with him. The bone scan does show an abnormality at L5, but with data from plain films this appears to not be consistent with a met lesion. He also has had recurrent problems with bleeding from hemorrhagic radiation cystitis. This occurs once every few months or so and is not currently bothering him. He states that he is scheduled to have a cystoscopy at the BNH next week, however, is unsure if he has had a urine cytology done.





Impression: In reviewing the patient's limited records that he brings and his history, it appears that he has had the appropriate care at the BNH. I have reassured him of this, and have indicated that he should just make sure that a urine cytology is also checked and that a repeat PSA be performed in the near future. I also informed him that he will likely need anti-androgen therapy in the future for further treatment of his prostate CA. He may follow up with me if he has questions in the future.

INPATIENT CONSULTATION

PATIENT: Ulysses Quin
LMH NUMBER: 9523697
REFERRING PHYSICIAN: Dr. Ziemba 
DATE OF Consultation: 3/08/76

PATIENT ID: Mr. Quin is a 74 y/o gentleman with metastatic prostate cancer, new L4 met with pain who is seen for consideration of radiation therapy.
 
HPI:  
Mr. Quin's oncological history begain in 2061 when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer (unknown gleason, PSA).  He underwent radical prostatectomy in 2061 and salvage XRT in 2062.  His care was at BNH and we don't have his XRT records.  The patient recalls 37 treatments.   The patient was well until he had an elevated PSA of 3.52 in 10/75.  He underwent a bone scan in 11/75 showing worrisome uptake at L5. In 1/76 he had a PSA of 17.46.  He has also developed lower back pain requiring MS Contin for pain control.  His course was complicated by a possible bladder/urethral infection.  He is incontinent from his surgery.  In 2/76 he had a cystoscopy which revealed nodules in the bladder (TCC vs. prostatic scar/inflammation).  
The patient's LLP worsened.   He reports occasional severe shooting pain that lead to gait imbalance.  On the day of presentation, he experienced severe acute back pain while getting out of bed.  The pain was so intolerable that he asked his daughter to bring him to the emergency room. Just before arrival to the ED he developed stridor, in his words he was    sucking air in and out.     ENT was consulted in the ED and determined that he had a limited glottic gap, and that the acute stridor was most likely secondary to anxiety and increased air flow through a restricted glottic opening, recommending humidified air by shovel air mask, steroids, and outpatient followup.  MRI of the lumbar spine showed metastatic disease involving of the L4 vertebral body, extending into the pedicles, both L4-5 neural foramina, and the prevertebral soft tissues.  No compression of the thecal sac.

Mr. Quin reports improved pain since admission.  He still has some pain when moving from one position to anther.  he denies fecal incontinence, saddle anesthesia, LE weakness or paresthesia.  He would like to be cared at the LMH from now on.  The patient had an oncologist from BNH but does not remember his name.

IMPRESSION and PLAN:   
74 y/o gentleman with metastatic prostate cancer, new L4 metastasis and pain.  The patient's LBP is likely due to his spine met.  Based on the MRI results, his symptoms and his exam we believe he is an appropriate candidate for palliative radiotherapy to his L-spine.  I discussed with Mr. Quin the likely cause of his pain.  We then discussed the treatment options.  Mr. Quin would like to undergo a course of palliative radiotherapy to relieve his pain.  We will simulate (plan) the patient's XRT tomorrow am, with a treatment to follow on the same day.  All of the patient's questions were answered to his satisfaction.  We would also recommend an GU oncology consultation regarding the patient's ADT and other possible systemic therapies.  The patient only had L-spine MRI, a bone scan may be of benefit to establish the extent of metastatic disease.

Reason for Visit

patient is here to establish primary care

He has metastatic prostate cancer and has completed 12 cycles of radiation to the back with good effect. Last PSA was 1.7.  Is receiving Lupron every 3 months (after his 6 weeks pf Casodex).;





History of Present Illness

Mr. Quin presented in 2061 with a PSA of around 4 and a prostate cancer of unknown clinical grade. Radical retropubic prostatectomy was performed in the BNH system, and disease extended beyond the prostate to the margins of the resection and into the seminal vesicle. In early 2062 he received adjuvant radiation. His PSA remained undetectable throughout the 2060s, but was troubled by a great deal of radiation cystitis with hematuria, frequency, and dysuria. In addition, he was totally incontinent. In 2071 his PSA was undetectably low.   

Over the last 8 months, he has developed low back pain of progressively increasing severity. His PSA back in September 2075 was approximately 3 and when checked in November was 17. Early this year his pain was of great severity, and repeat CT scans and bone scans were performed. Destructive disease was seen in the body of L4 with foraminal encroachment. The thecal sac and the cauda quina were, however, intact. He was started in early February on bicalutamide and was scheduled to have a Zoladex injection, but his pain became more and more severe, and ultimately he was admitted to the LMH last week where I first met him. Since admission he was started on urgent radiotherapy and has completed 12 cycles of radation with a last PSA of 1.7.  He is due for Lupron injection on 6/13/76 at which time a PSA will be checked.

His oncologist Dr. Leblanc has helped him wean the MS Contin and tried to start adding low dose gabapentin as a narcotic sparing agent for presumed neuropathic pain.  He is not requiring his prn pain meds very often.

He has claudication.

He has symmetric leg edema worse right after lupron injection and improved with TEDS.  No chest symptoms.





Problems

      Prostate cancer

Plan as above

      Claudication    : has buttock pain when walking which resolves when stopping.  He has decreased pulses in his DPs bilaterally and has a h/o smoking and diabetes.

      Diabetes mellitus type 2

checks his sugars infrequently.  He is on glyburide 10 am 5 pm.  He had his eyes checked by an opthalmologist recently and no evidence of retinopathy was present. He has no early satiety, blurry vision, polyuria polydipsia, foot ulcers, chest pain, shorteness of breath, but does have some claudication.  He is not on an ACE- inhibitor, takes HCTZ for BP control and has had hematuria from aspirin.

MSCOntin 30 mg am 30 pm with Morphine 15 mg q4h for breakthough but not needing it.

Prilosec 40

Gabapentin Just restarted 100 mg po tid





Disposition and Plans

1. Pain- I think he has a component of neuropathic pain.  I think that we will start low dose neuronitni 100 tid for 7 days, he will email me about how his pain is and we will cut his pm MScontin in half if we can.  I do not want to have to use exteremely high doses of gabapentin to spare narcotics because he is not a drug seeker and I want him to be comfortable and he has no congnitive problems with safe adminstration or dosing.  His PSA is low and will continue to follow.  If his pain is at night which sometimes it is, he could have a component of restless legs from arterial insufficiency, will check PVRs anyway to rule that out

2. Cluadication- check PVRs, most likely has bilateral iliofemoral disease. He does not want to take aspirin given hiematuria in the past. I will broach this issue next time again

3. DM- will email me his sugars and will adjust oral agents as necessary,. He needs U/a for microalb, eas encourgagd to wear shoes in house, will check PVrs, will start low dose lisinopril for BP and prevention of diabetic nephropathy and heck creatinine and K one week after starting the medicaiton.  Will check lipids.  Will continue to monitor BP.  Will start aspirin when he is willing.

 

Plan to follow up with patient by email

will see in clinic RTC in 3 months

Chief Complaint

urosepsis



History of Present Illness

Mr. Quin is well known to me. He has a severely dysfunctional bladder and severe urethral stricture 2/2 radiation therapy for prostate CA. He has been dependent on a SP tube for bladder drainage, however, after the past 2 SP tube changes, he has developed urosepsis. He now presents again in urosepsis after his most recent SP tube change. He also complains of bilateral pelvic/hip pain which is limiting his ability to walk without a walker. This is a marked change over the past 3 months.

Assessment

1. Urosepsis - Treat as you are with Levofloxacin.

2. Bilateral hip pain - given subacute nature of this worsening problem, I would obtain a CT scan of the lower abdomen/pelvis to r/o any drainable fluid collections that we cannot appreciate on PE.

3. Long term plan - I have discussed with Mr. Quin that we are likely headed toward needing a surgical urinary diversion with an ileal conduit. He understands this and is still considering this. We will continue this discussion in outpatient follow up.

Review of Systems	

Patient says that she gets short of breath while climbing up stairs, and cannot walk more than a block or two without getting shortness of breath.  She always has edema in both legs, except when she arises in the a.m. at which time her legs are free of edema.  At the same time, she denies PND and says that she sleeps on only one pillow. She denies chest pain, says that she eats well and has regular BMs.  Her biggest complaint now is urinary pressure and urgency.  She had been using a Pessary for Uterine decensus, but it was removed by Gyn and she was prescribed local Estrogen cream, which has not yet helped.  She was advised to call Gyn for another visit, since she was scheduled about 6 weeks from now.

	Reason for visit:
   Asked by Medicine team to see this 88 yo woman who presents with UGIB 9 d after inferior STEMI/BMS PCI to PLV/RCA


	Interval History:
   Ms. Ulrich is a 88 yo w/ h/o CAD, DM2, and dyslipidemia, who was admitted 10 d ago with an inferior STEMI in the setting of nauseau and CP, who subsequently received BMS stents to the RPLV and mid RCA.  Plavix was reloaded for 1 week in this setting.  She was discharged to a rehab facility in pauls valley 8/10/96 for PT/OT.  At the rehab facility she developed hematemesis and was admitted to the medicine service last night for UGIB.  She denies CP/SOB/N at present.  She does not have memory of the hematemesis episodes overnight.  She required some reorientation to the situation leading to her readmission.


	Past medical history:
   1. CAD:
-s/p PCI of PDA 2089 for 99% lesion in setting of ACS, s/p PCI of 99% LAD lesion in 2090 also in setting of ACS, residual LV function normal w/o focal WMA in 2091.  Inferior STEMI 7/96 due to near occlusion of PLV resulting in BMS to PLV and mid RCA.
2. HTN/Hypertensive heart disease: rather difficult to control HTN, needing multiple agents to achieve near normal to high normal pressures.  Had a good bp response to thiazides but caused unacceptable degree of hyponatremia.  BP also related to the degree of chronic low back pain, and was substantially better for 6 months after localized treatment.  Hypertensive HD manifest primarily as peripheral edema, worsened by norvasc, improved on diuretic.
3. Dyslipidemia
4. DMII
5. Postherpetic neuralgia  
6. Depression  
7. Hemorrhoids  
8. Osteoarthritis  
9. h/o DVT /PE
10. Breast CA  96 T2N1MO ER/PR+ Her2 neg breast CA s/p L radical mastectomy, XRT, and tamoxifen x 10 years  
11. Recurrent UTI  
12. Urinary incontinence 
13. History of HIT AB Positive 2090


	Family history:
   There is a history of non-premature cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease:  Her father died of a stroke in his 80s, her mother had congestive heart failure, and a brother had an MI.  Her other siblings have lived into their 80s.


	Social history:
   She has not smoked, and uses alcohol only rarely.  She lives at home with her youngest daughter, Vaccaro.  Another daughter, Tiffany, has been also very involved in her mother's care.


	Review of systems:
   As above, otherwise negative in detail. 

Physical examination:
	
-Pulse: 58  
-resp. rate:  16  
-Abdomen:   soft NT and ND, no hepatosplenomegaly, no pulsatile masses.
-Neuro:   a + oriented to self, needs orientation to location and context
-Extremities:   trace lower extremity edema, 1+ bilat PT pulses, 2+ radial pulses
-Chest:   cleart to auscultation anteriorly without crackles or wheezes
-Neck:   JVP not elevated, no HJR, no carotid bruits
-HEENT:   NC/AT, with mild ptosis of left eyelid from post herpetic changes
-General appearance:   A WD, WN elderly woman in no acute distress. Answering questions propriately, but requiring reorientation.
-BP: 155/60  


	EKG:
   NSR, CRO old IMI, NSSTTWAs, no significant change


	Impression:
   88 yo woman with extensive CAD history, HTN and DM2 recently started on oral agents, now presents with UGIB in setting of plavix extended reload of 150 QD x 1 week.

Agree with reducing plavix to 75 QD for now in combination with low dose ASA.  Despite low level cardiac marker elevation there is little suggest an intercurrent coronary syndrome currently complicating the UGIB.  Would try to continue antiplatelet therapy for a minimum of 30 days, and preferably for 90 days in the setting of recently placed bare metal stents, if tolerable from a hemodynamic and hemostatic perspective.  Agree with switching to short term beta blocker, and holding lasix for now given apparent volume depletion.  Continue high dose statin, ARB, and low dose CCB for BP control.

If UGIB continues to stabilize would prefer to maintain on H2 blocker rather than PPI to limit interference with antiplatelet therapy with plavix.  

Will follow with you.

The patient was seen by me along with Dr. Abbott on 06/13/2085. 

The history is documented by Dr. Abbott, was reviewed by me with

the patient, found to be accurate and complete.  The physical

exam was confirmed by my examination.  Evaluation and management

was also concurred with.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In brief, this is a 56-year-old male

who enters with a history of after sitting playing a piano,

developed shortness of breath, had decreased ability to breathe. 

Says he had some diaphoresis this morning, dyspnea on exertion

which he has noted that he has been having repeated exertional

dyspnea over the past several days, worsening today when he had

diaphoresis accompanying with no chest pain but felt confused and

did not know where he is supposed to be going in the building until

he was overhead paged to report to specific room, when he looked

up 25 minutes had gone by and he was unaware of what had happened

during that time.  He has had some mild upper respiratory tract

infection about a week ago.  No nausea, no vomiting, no

dizziness, no abdominal pain, and the patient states that he is

feeling much better while he was being given some oxygen but just

feels like he has no energy.  The patient had a cardiac

catheterization in December of 2081 and had a luminal

irregularities and 30% stenosis and echocardiogram revealed 55%

ejection fraction.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has history of coronary

disease, MI, and hypercholesterolemia.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Smoked in the past for 30 years.  He is a

Senior Manager of Broadcasting by occupation.  Lives with his family.

Review of systems, allergies, and medications are as documented

in the chart.  Please see Dr. Abbott' notes for details.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Awake, alert, well-developed,

well-nourished male in mild distress.  Temperature 96.6, pulse

100, respirations 20, blood pressure 164/86.  Lungs clear. 

Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen is flat,

nondistended, bowel sounds normoactive, nontender, no pedal

edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 7.9, electrolytes are normal,

hematocrit 36.  CK was elevated at 657, troponin was negative. 

The patient's D-dimer was 211 and an EKG showed T-wave inversions

in aVL, V5 and V6 which ________ from previous chest x-ray was

negative.

DIAGNOSIS:  Acute coronary syndrome, rule out myocardial

infarction.

As such was admitted to Medicine on 06/13/2085.

1. OBESITY - he feels his weight is down a little.  He has been trying to eat

mainly meat and vegetables, but he is ""stupid"" sometimes and cheats.



2. HYPERTENSION - in good range.  He has been making an effort to avoid Na.



3. PROTEINURIA  - he has been off Naprosyn for about 6 weeks, has appt scheduled with Dr. Fry 6/05.  Will plan to repeat 24 hr urine for protein towards the end of next week.  His pedal edema has improved considerably, so possibly his albumin is better.



4. DJD - Ultam is helpful, but not as good as Naprosyn.  Knees and ankles are stiff and painful, especially if he is active and then sits still for a while.

Also has some pain in left groin/thigh c/w tendonitis.

This patient was seen with Dr. Nabor Jacoby.
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 29 year old woman with diabetes and 
obesity.  Her problems are as follows:
 
1.   Diabetes.  She was sent to me from OB/GYN because of her high glucose 
     and she was put on insulin by me.  Xitlali Xia followed her in 
     order to get her on a good dose but then she was lost to follow up as 
     she did not come to her appointments and did not return phone calls.  
     She finally comes back and I am relieved, but she has not brought any 
     list of her blood sugars.  She says she does take them about twice a 
     day and she did write them down but her daughter ripped them up and 
     threw them away.  She says that they never go higher than 200; that 
     they usually are about 110.  It was 101 this morning before 
     breakfast, she says.  She says it does get as low as 19 and five or 
     six times it has been below 50.  She does say she eats three regular 
     meals but then later in the morning when I asked her if she had eaten 
     breakfast she said no.  She is seeing a nutritionist this morning.
 
     I will check a hemoglobin A1C today.  I expressed to her again how 
     important it is that she eat three regular meals, but not sweets.  
     She had been eating a lot of chocolate.  She says she has gotten off 
     of a lot of this although she does have cravings for it and eats it 
     then.  She is going to a nutritionist today and I hope that she will 
     help her with her diet.  If her diet does get better, maybe we can 
     wean her off the insulin and try Micronase.  I explained to her, too, 
     that if she both had a good diet and lost some weight that we might 
     be able to get her off the insulin.  This seemed to be something that 
     she would like to do.  Hopefully the nutritionist can help.  I also 
     told her that in order to find out what was going on that I need her 
     to take her blood sugar before breakfast, lunch, dinner and sleep, 
     and then come back in a week and a half so that we can see what was 
     really going on and whether they are getting too low.  She denies any 
     kind of symptoms with even as low a blood sugar as 19.  I am 
     wondering if she is remembering all these blood sugars correctly.  
     She had no shakiness, no loss of consciousness, no dizziness, no 
     nothing.  She felt totally normal.  So hopefully she will really 
     record these and we will get a better idea.  She said this always 
     happens in the morning.  She kept contradicting herself and had no 
     documentation.  I went over with her the symptoms of hypoglycemia.  
     Once she had a low blood sugar by fingerstick.  She does drink juice, 
     but I went over the symptoms again with her.  She will call me if she 
     does have any.
                                              10-19-86
 
 
 
2.   Left ankle pain.  I sent her to the orthopedist as she requested.  
     She said that she may do some surgery on her.
 
3.   Dysuria.  She says this is totally resolved after giving her the 
     Bactrim.
 
4.   Yeast infection.  She said this has also resolved.
 
5.   She complains of headache.  She says these have been going on for two 
     or three months; that light and noise bother her when she has some.  
     She has had nausea and vomited once.  This happened pretty much every 
     day and it can be at any time of the day.  Tylenol and Advil did not 
     help.  She knows she is going to have a headache because it starts in 
     the back of her left ear very faintly and then it spreads from there.  
     But she has no further prodrome.  She says it is a banging kind of 
     pain that is rhythmic.  She also says she does see stars in front of 
     her eyes when it happens.  I asked her if she had any hearing loss, 
     and she said that she hears voices but people are not there 
     sometimes.  It has been happening for a couple of weeks.  I discussed 
     this with Dr. Jacoby and we both agreed that these do sound like 
     migraines.  I will not image her head now as there is no evidence 
     that this would be something to do with brain tumor.  Her neuro exam 
     was totally normal.  Cranial nerves II-XII were checked and intact.  
     Her gait was normal.  Light touch was touched.  Her toes were 
     downgoing.  Her reflexes were symmetric bilaterally.  Her disks were 
     sharp.  EOMI, PERRL.  I gave her a prescription for Motrin, 600 mg PO 
     t.i.d. and told her to take one the minute she got the pain behind 
     her left ear.  I will see her in a week and a half to reassess this.
 
6.   Health maintenance.  I thought that since she is diabetic and obese 
     that she might benefit from a flu shot.  She has no interest in this 
     at all.  Her blood pressure was 110/70 in the left arm with a thigh 
     cuff.  Her pulse was 96.  Her blood sugar was 151 and her weight was 
     285.

HPI:  Ms. Youngman is a 30-year-old woman with diabetes who comes in for a 
regular follow-up.
 
Assessment and Plan:
1.   Diabetes.  She said she has been doing well, sticking to her diet, 
     has had no hypoglycemic episodes, and that her fingersticks have been 
     ranging between 120 and 160, never above and never below.  This is 
     borne out by her last hemoglobin A1C on 6-04-87 which was 4.9.  She 
     definitely does have good control, and she is working hard as her weight 
     is down to 236 lb from 238.75 on 6-29-87.  She had a recent hemoglobin A1C 
     and urine dip.  She, however, is due for an eye exam as she has no had one 
     for over a year and is willing to go, so I referred her.  She also needs 
     to see a Podiatrist as she has not seen one; she will go.
 
2.   Health maintenance.  Patient does not want a flu shot.  Otherwise, 
     she is up to date except for a Pap smear, but she had her daughter 
     with her so asked if she could have her Pap smear on her next visit.  
     We will do so.
 
3.   Migraine headaches.  She said she has had one every day recently.  
     This is worse than her usual.  The Motrin was not helping.  I 
     therefore prescribed Midrin and explained to her expressly how to 
     use.  Should this not help, she will page me as she knows how to do.  
     I will see her back soon to make sure this is getting better.
 
4.   Ankle pain.  Patient has chronic ankle pain.  She went to an 
     Orthopedist who told her a while back to lose weight and see if it 
     got better.  She has been slowly losing weight with no improvement 
     and would like to go back to the Orthopedist.  I therefore referred 
     her at her request.

HPI:  Ms. Youngman is a 31 year old woman with a history of morbid obesity, 
complicated by diabetes, who was a former patient of Dr. Xitlali Crane.  
She comes in today for routine follow-up.  Patient's diabetes was 
initially diagnosed during gestation with her daughter.  Patient was 
formerly controlled by insulin but has lost 61 pounds over the last 16 
months and is now off all medications and states her finger sticks have 
been excellent with a peak of about 150, with most well below that.  
Patient also has a history of        in situ which was treated with laser 
treatment to the cervix.  She is a hemophiliac carrier.  Has a history of 
migraines and currently is being treated by Dr. Jacoby for depression.  
Since her last visit with Dr. Crane, patient apparently attempted suicide 
in July.  It is unclear how serious the attempt was although she did cut 
her left upper extremity.  Since then she states that she has been feeling 
a lot better and feels that she has really made progress with Dr. Jacoby.  
Her mood seems fine today in clinic.  Patient denies any medical symptoms 
at this time.
 
Patient's cardiac risk factors include smoking 5-6 cigarettes a day.  A 
positive family history of coronary artery disease including a mother who 
just died of a heart attack in May at age 53 and had had a previous MI at 
age 40 and a CABG at age 43.  Patient does not have hypercholesterolemia 
or hypertension but does have the diabetes history as noted above.
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Notable for tobacco use as noted above and she drinks 
about one beer per day when she is distraught that she continues to do.  
She says that she should not be drinking with her medications.
 
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Moderately obese Hispanic woman in no acute distress.  
Blood pressure: 120/70.  HEENT: unremarkable.  Neck: no JVD, carotids were 
2+ bilaterally without bruits.  Chest: clear.  Cardiac: within normal 
limits.  Abdomen: benign.  Extremities: without edema.
 
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
1.   Weight control:  Patient has had excellent weight loss over the last 
     16 months.  I told her how impressed I was with this.  She, in fact, 
     does not require any oral hypoglycemics for good sugar control at 
     this time.  I will let her continue this dietary control for the next 
     six months and check her hemoglobin A1C at that time to assess her 
     control.  However, in the past, she has been very straight forward 
     with Dr. Crane according to her notes.
2.   Depression:  Patient continues to be actively depressed.  Is 
     currently on trazodone, Klonopin, Paxil and Motrin.  She will 
     continue to follow-up with Dr. Jacoby with whom she seems to be very 
     happy.

                                              9-14-88
 
 
 
3.   General health care:  Patient will need a pelvic exam in six months 
     time.  Patient currently has an intrauterine device which was placed 
     in June.  She does not take oral contraceptives because of her 
     history of diabetes and history of heart disease.  She was instructed 
     that she should go to Gynecological Clinic if any symptoms related to 
     the IUD occur.
4.   Diabetes:  Patient's blood sugars have had peaks of about 150 as 
     mentioned above.  I will check her hemoglobin A1C in six months time.  
     Patient feels good with no polydipsia, no urinary frequency and no 
     headache.  I elected, therefore, not to treat it at this time.  
     Patient was given prescriptions for fingersticks and lancets.

IDENTIFICATION:  Ms. Youngman is a 36 year old woman with the following 
medical problems: 

1.   Type II diabetes mellitus.
2.   CAD.
3.   History of CIN2 status post laser treatment to the cervix.
4.   Depression.
5.   History of substance abuse.
6.   GERD.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Enteric-coated aspirin 325mg PO q.d., atenolol 
25mg PO q.d., glyburide 5mg PO q.d., Lipitor 10mg PO q.h.s., Celexa 20mg 
PO q.d., Zantac 150mg PO q.h.s., Prevacid 30mg PO q.d., trazodone 150mg 
PO q.h.s.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Youngman returns to clinic today to 
follow up regarding her diabetes, coronary artery disease, and 
depression.  Since I last saw her, she presented to Urgent Care 
complaining of some epigastric discomfort and was referred to 
Gastroenterology where apparently she was started on Prevacid at 30mg a 
day in addition to maintenance with q.h.s. Zantac and scheduled for a 
upper GI series with a small bowel follow-through with a plan to add a 
pro-motility agent if there was no structural abnormalities on her GI 
study.  She is scheduled later this month.  She has no new complaints, 
although she recently stopped taking her glyburide and has not refilled 
it over the past two days.  She denies any increasing polyuria, 
polydipsia, polyphagia.  Says until yesterday, she had been taking all 
of her medications regularly, although mostly at night rather than in 
the morning.  I pressed her about this because she has a history of 
being noncompliant with her medicines in the past, but she does maintain 
that she has been taking them.  It is not entirely clear to me whether 
this is true or not.  

Regarding her depression, she denies any suicidal ideation.  She says 
she is feeling a little bit better.  She was recently started on 
risperidone in addition to her Celexa, apparently by a psychiatrist at 
the Connerstone Regional Hospital by the name of Dr. Lehman whom she sees once 
a month.  She is also seeing a counselor there weekly.  She says overall 
she is doing a little bit better, although still intermittently binge 
drinking and occasionally smoking marijuana.  We again discussed the 
importance of AA; she says she is not interested in that.  

Regarding her coronary disease, she continues to have exertional angina 
after approximately 14 steps which has not increased in intensity or 
frequency.  She denies any PND or orthopnea, denies any chest pain at 
rest.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  She is a morbidly obese woman in no acute distress.  Her 
pulse is 80 and regular, blood pressure 134/74.  Her weight today is 
249lb.  Her sclera are nonicteric.  Her JVP is not visible at 90 
degrees.  There are no carotid bruits.  Her lungs are clear to 
auscultation bilaterally, and her cardiac exam reveals a regular rhythm, 
positive S1, S2.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.  Her 
extremities are warm and without significant edema.  Her finger stick 
blood sugar in the office today was 331.

ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  Thirty six year old woman with multiple medical 
problems, including a history of noncompliance and substance abuse.

1.   Diabetes.  Her last hemoglobin A1C was approximately 9.3, 
     essentially unchanged from six months prior.  Finger stick in the 
     office is 331 today, confirming her recent noncompliance and would 
     now describe that she has not been taking her medicine regularly 
     over the past couple of months.  In any event, she most likely need 
     a higher dose of sulphonurea.  We will check a hemoglobin A1C 
     today, and if it remains in the 9 range or higher, will increase 
     her glyburide to 10mg daily, and I talked to her about the plan.  
     Her last urine microalbumin was negative.

2.   Hypercholesterolemia.  When she returns to clinic in three months, 
     we will recheck a lipid profile by which time she will have been on 
     Lipitor for approximately six months.

3.   Coronary disease.  She is still having exertional chest pain.  
     Increased her atenolol to 50mg PO q.d. as she did have room to go 
     with her pulse and blood pressure.

4.   Depression.  I again encouraged her to continue following up with 
     her psychiatrist and her counselor.  Again, reinforced the 
     importance of trying to remain substance free and recommended AA 
     again as I have in the past.

5.   GERD.  She will follow up with Gastroenterology and continue on her 
     PPI and H2 blocker for now.  I told her she should take the 
     Prevacid in the morning and the Zantac at night only.

6.   Health maintenance.  She received a flu shot and she will return to 
     clinic in three months to follow up on her diabetes, 
     hypercholesterolemia, and coronary disease.  Additionally, I 
     referred her to Nutrition for further counseling regarding weight 
     loss and a heart-healthy diabetic diet.  I also stressed the

PROBLEMS:  Ms. Youngman is a 37-year-old woman with the following 

medical problems:

1.	Diabetes.

2.	History of polysubstance abuse.

3.	Recent bilateral pyelonephritis.

4.	History of CIN 2 and laser to cervix.

5.	Depression.

6.	CAD with ischemia on MIBI in October 2093.

7.	Gallstones.

8.	Status post appendectomy in July 2093.

9.	GERD.



CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Include glyburide 15 mg p.o. q.d., Prevacid 

30 mg p.o. q.d., atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d., Lipitor 10 mg p.o. 

q.d., enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., Celexa 20 mg p.o. 

q.d., and trazodone 150 mg p.o. q.h.s.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Youngman returns to clinic today 

for follow up regarding her diabetes.  Since I last saw her, she 

has been hospitalized with bilateral pyelonephritis in mid 

October.  Since discharge, she has been feeling well, and a 

repeat urinalysis and urine culture on October 27, 2094, were 

essentially within normal limits.  She denies any recurrent flank 

pain, fevers, chills, or dysuria.  Says overall she is feeling 

relatively well.  She is taking all of her medications as 

prescribed.  She denies any polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, 

fatigue, or blurry vision.  She continues to smoke.  She has not 

been exercising.  She also continues to have intermittent chest 

pain of unclear etiology.  Several days ago, she had an episode 

that lasted a minute or two at rest.  She described it as a 

tightness, and it was not associated with shortness of breath, 

nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or neck or arm symptoms.  She has 

no recurrent symptoms since then, and has had no exertional 

symptoms in the past few days.  She has not been taking her blood 

sugars at home as her machine is broken.  Also, she self-

discontinued her lisinopril.  She thought it gave her a headache.







Youngman, Codi 

06386371

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is an obese young woman in no 

distress.  Pulse 68 and regular.  Blood pressure 134/84 and 

weight 226.  Fingerstick today 198.  Neck veins are non-elevated.  

No carotid bruits.  Oropharynx is clear.  Lungs are clear to 

auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac exam is regular rhythm.  

Normal S1 and S2.  No murmurs.  Extremities are warm and without 

edema.  Feet are without ulcerations and sensation is intact to 

vibration and light touch.



LABORATORY DATA:  Her EKG today reveals a normal sinus rhythm, 

normal axis, normal intervals, normal ST segments, and normal T-

waves.  Hematocrit and troponin are pending.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN: A 37-year-old woman with multiple medical 

problems as follows:

1.	Type 2 diabetes.  Her hemoglobin A1c has continued to run in 

the 9.0.  She is poorly controlled and remains unwilling to 

try Glucophage again due to the diarrhea.  At this point, it 

is prudent to consider switching her over to an insulin 

regimen starting with b.i.d. NPH, and we will refer her to the 

diabetic teaching nurse, and see her back in about a month 

with a plan to transition her at that time.  Her urine 

microalbumin was negative a few months ago.  We will recheck 

her hemoglobin A1c today.  She has been to the ophthalmologist 

recently, and does not need to see the podiatrist as of yet.

2.	Regarding her chest pain, her persistent intermittent chest 

pain is somewhat concerning.  She does have coronary disease 

as per her MIBI just over a year ago.  She is taking an 

aspirin and a beta-blocker.  Her EKG today is normal, and she 

has been symptom free for at least the past 2-3 days even with 

exertion.  Given this, I advised her should she have recurrent 

pain at rest or with minimal exertion to call me and come to 

the emergency room, otherwise, to continue taking her aspirin 

and beta-blocker.  I will repeat her stress test to see if her 

ischemic burden has increased in which case we will consider 

referring her to Cardiology.

3.	Regarding her hypertension, given her diabetes, we would 

prefer better blood pressure control.  She agreed to try the 

lisinopril again at a small dose, and will let me know if she 

thinks it disagrees with her.  I told her I felt the headache 

was probably unrelated to the lisinopril.

4.	Regarding health maintenance, when I see her back in a month, 

I will do a Pap smear and give her a flu shot, as she left 

today without receiving one.  

5.	I will see her back in clinic in one month.

                     CARDIOLOGY OFFICE NOTE
 
NOTE
     Ms. Uher returns after a 4  year hiatus.  She is now 52 and
has long-standing insulin dependant diabetes with a h/o retinopathy
OS, possible peripheral neuropathy but not known nephropathy.  She
had a maximal negative exercise test in 2059 and has felt generally
well since that time.  Over the past year she has not been as
careful as previously with her diet and has not been checking her
sugars regularly.  A random cholesterol w/i the past year was over
300.
     She has intermittently had sharp, brief discomforts of the
anterior chest lasting only seconds and not accompanied by dyspnea,
diaphoresis or light-headedness.  There has not been any reduction
in her physical capacity, in fact, she feels stronger than a year
ago and is working full-time.  There has been no orthopnea, PND or
peripheral edema.  She is interested in increasing her physical
activity program.
     Cardiac risk factors include remote smoking, stopped by age
20, hypercholesterolemia and family history in that her father
developed coronary disease possibly in his 50's.  She is
perimenopausal and has discussed later estrogen usage with her
gynecologist Dr. Bradley Brandt.
     Her only medication is lente insulin taken twice per day.
 
EXAM
     She is comfortable at rest.  BP 110/76, HR 80 and reg.  No
JVD.  Carotids full w/o bruits.  Chest clr.  Cardiac exam shows
normal heart sounds w/o gallop or murmur.  Abd. soft w/o
organomegaly.  No peripheral edema.
     Resting EKG shows sinus rhythm with normal intervals and axis
and is a normal tracing.
     For further evaluation of her chest discomforts and to help
gauge her exercise program an exercise treadmill test was performed
using the standard bruce protocol.  She exercised for 9 minutes, 8
seconds and stopped because of knee discomfort but not because of
chest pain or inordinate dyspnea.  Peak heart rate was 143 (85%
maximal predicted) with an appropriate rise in systolic pressure. 
There were no diagnostic changes of ischemia at this good work
load.  Compared to the test of 9/15/59 she exercised 1 minute, 4
seconds longer.
 
IMPRESSION
     1.  No evidence of clinical coronary disease at this time. 
She has major risk factors of insulin dependant diabetes,
hypercholesterolemia, family h/o coronary disease and a
perimenopausal state.  She will be seeing Dr. David Yun as
her primary care provider, and would urge that a fasting lipid
profile be obtained and that dietary/pharmacologic therapy be

instituted to achieve an LDL cholesterol <130.  From a cardiac
standpoint, post-menopausal estrogen therapy would be desired.  Low
dose aspirin therapy could also be considered.
     I would be happy to see Ms. Uher for additional cardiac
evaluation as needed in the future.

She returns to clinic for follow up. Unfortunately she missed her
entire appointment and did not bring her blood glucose log with
her. She reports that at 4 a.m. last Thursday she woke up and felt
disoriented with sweats. She checked her blood glucose, it was 50,
and she treated herself by eating. This led to resolution of her
symptoms, although she said that she overshoots. She has developed
a foot infection, has been seen by a podiatrist and started on
antibiotics. She has also been taking a thyroid hormone but she
still feels that it is making her tired. She just in general has
not been feeling as well as she had been previously.
 
Past Medical History:
 
1.   IDDM.
 
Medications: See previous notes.
 
Allergies:  Same.
 
Physical Examination:  Not performed. The patient had a  special
orthopedic shoe on, her foot was wrapped.
 
Impression:  Patient with IDDM with usual blood glucoses in the
200's and an elevated A1C. Discussed the need for consistent meals
and exercise and need for more control. Will increase day time
insulin to 17 units of Lente and evening will stay at 10. She will
follow up in one month. Will check a TSH today.

HPI: Ms Uher was doing well until 8/70 when she she was noted to have several ""staring spells."" At the same time she had increased gait instability leading to admission to SLMC. A head MRI was reportedly normal. She improved and was discharged without treatment or diagnosis. At that time she also noticed subtle decline in visual acuity and eye exam confirmed this. She was told that this was caused by her diabetes. Her vision continued to worsen and she was treated with laser OS. Over the past month her balance has worsened nad her vision has continued to deteriorate. She reports severe HA in 8/70 but none recently. She was seen by ophtalmology at SGAH and noted to have optic disc swelling, cotton wool spots and hemorrhages. She was sent to CCH EW for evaluation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient has a
new apartment.  She is actually in the process of moving. 
She recognizes that she is improving, and is very excited
about the fact that, during the course of the week, she went
out to Sel de la Terre, and also went through a movie with her
friend.  

Her sugars are still not well controlled.  She has been
liberalizing her diet, which I thought was appropriate.  I
did increase her morning insulin to 20 units of 30/70, and
suggested that she change from five units of NPH at bedtime
to 8 units of 30-70, taken with her supper, to try to give
her a little better coverage for her evening meal.  I wrote
a note to the nurse to actuate this change.  They actually
called me later in the evening, on page, and I discussed
this with them, at length, at that time, including the
rationale for this change.

She is not having any exertional or other chest pain.  No
orthopnea, PND or peripheral edema.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 135/80.  Heart rate
68 and regular.  Respirations 14.  Venous pressure 3.  Clear
chest.  S4, no S3.  No retrosternal dullness or rub.  She
has only a trace of ankle edema.

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Her verbal skills have improved.  She
got very nervous when I tried to test her cognitive skills,
and was able to give me the days of the week forward, but
not backwards.  I did not push her beyond that.  I did tell
her that we would need to check her TSH in a couple weeks'
time, to see if last increment had returned her to a
euthyroid state.

RE:  		Jaquante Xuereb

SRI: 		134-43-51



Dear Dr. You:



Thank you for asking me to consult in the care of this complex patient.  Mr. Xuereb is a 55-year-old white male who presents with an ischemic right foot.  He has a longstanding history of lower extremity occlusive disease and has worked as a high school principle.  He has undergone previous right SFA angioplasty in 2059, previous left SFA angioplasty and stent placement in 2062, previous right fem-pop above-knee bypass grafting in February 2070, previous left leg fem-pop bypass grafting with saphenous vein in April 2070 and a redo right fem below-knee popliteal bypass graft with a bifid saphenous vein performed in September 2070.  After this last procedure, the patient at the time of follow-up office visit was noted to have a nonfunctioning graft with an ischemic right lower extremity.  He denies any history of trauma.  He is a former smoker.  He denies any history of hypercoagulable states or history of significant coronary disease.  He does have longstanding non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus as well as hypertension and COPD.



Past surgical history is as above.



Medications include Glucophage, Lopid, Prilosec, Norvasc, hydrochlorothiazide, Lipitor, Effexor, Plavix 75 mg q.d., aspirin, albuterol, Serevent, Nasacort and Pulmicort.



No known drug allergies.



Review of systems is positive for diabetes, asthma and hypertension.  All other review of systems is negative as per H&P sheet.



Habits, he is a former tobacco smoker.  He denies alcohol use.



Family history is positive for MI, stroke and cancer.



On physical exam, the patient is a well-developed and well-nourished male in moderate discomfort.  Respiratory rate is 12-14.  Pulse is 60-70 and regular.  Weight is 172 pounds.  Blood pressure is 170/90 in the right arm, 150/90 in the left.  No jugular venous distention.  Normal respiratory effort.  Lungs are clear to auscultation.  Heart, regular rate and rhythm.  No murmur or bruit.  He has no palpable abdominal aortic aneurysm.  He has normal carotid, brachial, radial and femoral pulses bilaterally.  Absent pedal pulses on the right with Doppler signals, which are monophasic.  On the left side, he has adequately perfused foot with normal capillary refill and Doppler signals.  He has moderate edema in the right lower extremity.  No varicosities.  He does have dependent rubor, cyanosis of the right forefoot and purplish discoloration of the tips of the right second to fifth toes.  The right great toe is blanched.  He has no abdominal masses, tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly.  He has grossly intact musculoskeletal tone and strength with no dermatitis, ulcers or sores.  He is alert and oriented to person, place and time with slightly depressed affect.



Assessment and Plan:  



1. Ischemic right lower extremity consistent with thrombosed bypass graft.  We will plan to admit the patient for treatment with intravenous heparin and plan to schedule him for an urgent arteriogram within the next 24 hours.  We will attempt to identify any possible way to re-establish flow  with either thrombolysis and/or angioplasty and stenting.  If this is unsuccessful, he will ultimately require redo fem-pop bypass graft.

2. Tobacco abuse:  The patient needs to continue to remain abstinent from smoking.

3. Hypertension:  Moderately controlled on current medications.  His previous angiogram did not reveal any evidence of any hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis.  We will adjust him as appropriate from a medical standpoint.  

4. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.  The patient's blood sugars are currently under good control on Glucophage, which we will need to hold post arteriogram.  I will keep you informed as to the status of this very nice patient.  



Thank you for allowing me to participate in his management.  If I can be of any further assistance and management of this or any of your patients with cerebrovascular, aortic, renovascular or low peripheral vascular disease, particularly those in need of a minimally invasive vascular procedure, please feel free to contact me directly.  



Sincerely,







Shane R. Herring, M.D.

RE:  		Jaquante Xuereb

SRI: 		134-43-51



Dear Dr. You:



I had the pleasure of seeing our mutual patient, Mr. Jaquante Xuereb, in follow up evaluation in our vascular surgery clinic here at the Santa Rosa Infirmary today.  As you remember, he recently underwent a revision of his lower extremity bypass graft with thrombectomy of the fem-pop bypass graft and subsequent jump graft to the below-knee popliteal artery.  He returns today for follow up evaluation. 



He has a warm, well-perfused foot with a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse.  Unfortunately, over the last ten days he has developed increased erythema and tenderness on the medial aspect of his left knee with superficial skin breakdown consistent with either a staph or a strep cellulitis.  He had been on a course of p.o. antibiotics over a week ago for treatment of strep throat as well.  The patient has been increased his activity and prior to this time had been extremely active with no erythema, tenderness or drainage from his leg.  My concern is that he has increased warmth with blanching and erythema on the medial aspect of his knee consistent with a superficial cellulitis and I believe that he would benefit from hospital admission with a course of IV antibiotics, bedrest and elevate.  We will tentatively plan to admit him for localized wound care measures, treatment with IV Nafcillin on a q.4 hour basis.  In addition, he has intact femoral pulses on the left side.  He does report when he was ambulating he was having increased difficulty with claudication in the distal left lower extremity and calf region.  Most recent vascular lab studies dated November 29, 2070 reveal an ABI of 0.96 on the right, 0.56 on the left.  



I will keep you informed as to the status of Mr. Xuereb.  My concern is that if he does infect this PTFE graft we do not have any suitable autogenous conduit to perform an additional reconstruction and he would stand a very high chance of losing his limb at the knee level.  If I can be of any further assistance in the management of this or any of your other patients with vascular disease, particularly those in need of a minimally invasive vascular procedure, please feel free to contact me directly.





Sincerely,





Shane R. Herring, M.D.

Patient Name: XUEREB, JAQUANTE;  MRN: 1344351

Dictated on: 04/27/2071 by LILLIAN STEELE, N.P., PH.D. 



 

Mr. Xuereb returns to clinic for evaluation and management of recurrent ulcerations on the hypertrophic scar tissue along the medial aspect of the right lower extremity.  

 

Today, on physical examination, the wound bed measured 1 cm x 0.7 cm.  The wound bed was covered with yellow biofilm, which was debrided.  The underlying wound bed contained moist red tissue with a few drops of bloody drainage.  The margin was clear.  

 

IMPRESSION:  There has been epithelialization of the wound along the medial aspect of the right knee.  There has been no further disruption of the epithelium overlying the hypertrophic scar tissue.   



PLAN:  We will continue with dressing changes every two to three days per the following protocol: spray the wound with AllClenz wound cleanser followed by irrigation with normal saline 30 cc x 3; apply skin protectant to the periwound margin, Panafil paste 1/8"" thick to the wound bed, gauze dampened with normal saline (cut-to-fit), covered with DuoDerm secured with Medipore tape.  

 

Mr. Xuereb will return to clinic in two weeks.

Studies

EKG-NSR, dynamic t-wave changes anterior, ~1mm ST elevation worse than prior v4-v5

CXR:  Vascular congestion. 







Impression and Plan:  58 year old man with PVD, likely CAD but no available ischemic work-up. Resp decompensation likely secondary to pulmonary edema in the setting of volume load. There is some question as to what to do about EKG changes and mild troponin elevations. No definite ST elevations, but elevation in troponin does seem to be too soon to be directly attributable to flash pulmonary edema and resultant demand. Follow enzymes,  heparinize both for ?ischemia and for PVD with sheath in place. As not lilely ACS, not emergent indication for cath, but he was scheduled for elective cath 12/08 and likely would benefit from expedited diagnosis. 



Pump - intubated, diruesis as allowed by pressure (JVP up, some edema of CXR). Started on peripheral dopa, but this is at least partially related to sedation. 



Rhythm - Bradycardia, no acute issues



Iscenmia - Demand ischemia vs NSTEMI. Follow markers. Likely to cath today where it is propble he will have 3vd and require CT surg consult.  Have request FMC records. 



Heme - FFP + lasix prior to cath. Heparin, 



Resp -  Wean vent post cath/OP





Prophy - Heparin/nexium/peridex while vented.

Identification:  Patient is a 53-year old markedly obese female 
complaining of bilateral weight knee pain.  She denies any morning 
stiffness, any jelling phenomena.  She has had no trauma or effusions in 
the knee.  She had noted on x-ray many years ago that she had had a 
chipped bone in the right knee and some mild osteoarthritis but it has 
bothered her only intermittently until this year.  Last year she did go 
to Briggs Stratton and dropped to 270 lb. at which point her knees felt 
better, but currently she is back up to over 300 lb. and at her height 
of 5 ft. 1 in., she is in pain.  She has not visited a physician.  She 
has no internist who currently checks on her general medical health, but 
she does report that the occasional Advil she takes does produce some 
dyspepsia.  She has no history of gout, no history of psoriasis, no 
history of pseudogout or any rash, alopecia, headaches, shoulder or hip 
discomfort.  She does not complain of back pain but does have difficult 
walking 50 yards because of the knee pain.
 
Allergies:  None.
 
Medications:  Occasional Advil.
 
Past Surgical History:  Cholecystectomy 2064.  Two c-sections.
 
Past Medical History:  Negative for hypertension, diabetes, cancer, 
stroke, tuberculosis, hepatitis, asthma, heart disease.
 
Family History:  Mother is alive and well with no medical problems.  
Father is alive and well with no medical problems.  She has 12 siblings.  
One sibling died of pneumonia at a young age.  Another sibling has 
asthma.
 
Physical Examination;  She is a markedly obese female, no apparent 
distress.  She is 5 ft. 1 in. and weighs 304 lb.  Examination of joints:  
No evidence of active synovitis or pain in her DIPs, PIPs, MCPs, wrists, 
elbows, shoulders.  Bilateral hips are limited in internal external 
rotation but not because of pain-- due to obesity, bilateral knees have 
crepitus, but no warmth or swelling.  There is some pain at extremes of 
flexion on the left of 110 degrees.  Ankles and toes within normal 
limits.  Please note above in the clinical history that she does not 
complain of back pain but does have difficult walking 50 yards because 
of the knee pain.  The blood pressure could not be taken secondary to 
the fact that the large blood pressure 
cuff did not fit around her right arm. 
 
Impression:  
 
1.   Probable bilateral osteoarthritis.  I will obtain plain films and 
     have prescribed Disalcid 3 gm. a day p.r.n.   GI and renal side 
     effects explained.
                                              2-03-68
 
 
 
2.   We discussed seriously the need for weight loss.  She will be 
     referred to the nutritionist to get on a weight loss program.  She 
     will seriously entertain a weight loss program.  Patient will 
     return in a few months unless she has any further problems.
 
3.   I have referred her to an Internal Medicine doctor for health maintenance since 
     she does not have one as yet.

Ms. Quijano is a 61 yo morbidly obese woman with CAD, OA, and CHF who is in for follow-up of these problems.  



History of Present Illness	

She is working every day and feels much better than she did last year.  She has had multiple admissions in the past for CHF and for ischemia.  Recent echo shows septal and apical hypokinesis.  



She has had no chest pain.  She does not complain of SOB.  She does cough, but this is because of the air conditioning and postnasal drip, she believes.  



She also complains of severe knee pain, with the right worse than the left.  She can walk a little, but standing is very painful.  



In addition, she complains of some food intolerance.  She has a hard time eating breakfast because she gets abdominal cramps.  After eating orange juice, she gets terrible cramping and has to run to the bathroom to have a bowel movement.  She has changed her milk to lactaid, which she says helps.  Certain types of salad dressing also cause this reaction.

chest x-ray.  EKG showed sinus rhythm with T-wave inversion in A, V 

and L.  This is not new based on old cardiograms.  Chest x-ray 

shows some cardiomegaly and a fluffy chest x-ray indicating CHF.  

Electrolytes, BUN and creatinine normal.  Hematocrit of 45 and a 

normal white count.   

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  Initially systolic blood pressure 

was over 200 and diastolic over 91 and patient also received some 

Diltiazem for blood pressure control.  

Assessment:  This is a 62-year-old woman who has vomiting, 

diarrhea, and ""feeling sick"" and she has a chronic cough despite 

recent treatment with antibiotics, but no shortness of breath, now 

found to be in CHF on chest x-ray.  Patient has been diuresed.  PCP

RE:  Gerald, Marion 

MRN: 48967301 

DOV: 05/18/83



Dear Dr. Olive,



Thanks for asking me to see Marion Gerald who I saw on May 18.  She is 

referred for either fibromyalgia or polymyalgia.  The patient states she is 

currently 60 but was in her usual state of good health until 2065 when she 

developed diffuse chest wall pain and tingling.  This continued to bother her 

and she eventually was treated with steroids.  I am not sure she had a 

diagnosis of PMR or fibromyalgia.  She then was switched to ibuprofen which 

did not work particularly well.  Over this time, she would have intermittent 

episodes with nocturnal discomfort and most recently has increasing pain in 

her palms, back, neck, low back, legs, and into her arms.  She was seen by 

Dr. Zink at Barr Clinic, and no blood studies were obtained, but she states 

she had ""25 shots"" of steroids.  She denies any hot or swollen joints.  She 

has had occasional arm swelling but this has resolved.  Extensive ROS reveals 

no photosensitivity but she does have some oral ulcers and Raynaud's.  She 

has urgency regarding her bladder and has been evaluated but not particularly 

well.  She has continued to be concerned about that.  She has had fevers or 

chills but no temperature elevation.  She has intermittent abdominal pain but 

has had a colonoscopy two years ago and was evaluated for this.  She has 

morning stiffness of about an hour and nocturnal pain through the night.



Family history is otherwise remarkable for diabetes in her father.  Mother is 

85.  Two sons alive and well.  Two siblings alive and well except for 

hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.



Past medical history is pertinent for above.  She has had a partial 

hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, and fracture of her wrist.  Medications 

include for hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, the following: 

metformin 500 b.i.d., verapamil 240 b.i.d., Avapro 150 q.d., Pravachol 20 mg 

q.d., Bumex 20 q.d., cyclobenzaprine 10 q.d., Prilosec 20 q.d., and Allegra.  

No smoking or drinking history.  No allergies.  No other medical problems.



Social history is pertinent in that she lives in Elizabethtown.  She works as a 

midwife and director of Iowa Birth Clinic.  Her husband is 

a Broadcast Technician.  They have traveled quite a bit because of this.

Physical reveals a very pleasant woman in no distress.  Weight 152.  BP 

120/80.  She had a respiratory rate of 16.  She had full range of motion of 

all of her joints with tenderness in epicondyles, greater trochanters, and 

cervical and lumbar area.  Otherwise, no active synovitis or skin lesions.  

No oral ulcerations.  Good salivary pool.  No lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, 

or axillary adenopathy.  Chest: clear to A&P.  No carotid bruits.  Vascular 

exam: normal.  Cardiac exam: quiet precordium without murmur or gallop.  

Abdominal exam: nontender without hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities: without 

edema.



I suspect she has fibromyalgia.  I do not really know the place of steroids 

in this setting.  I will obtain chemistry profile including CPK, LFTs, TSH, 

CBC, ESR, as well as a urine, ANA, CRP, and RF.  I will see her back in four 

to six weeks.  She will get old records for me to review.  We will talk about 

what therapeutic interventions we may take at that time, but I really need to 

have more information because at this point her symptoms are rather benign.  

I will be in touch with her regarding these results as they come in.



Sincerely yours,

Dear Dr. Higgins,



Marion Gerald will be seeing you sometime in September for primary

care.  I was seeing her for various rheumatologic issues.  She

comes in today with ongoing pain in the left side of her face. 

Actually, upon exam, she clearly simply has left TMJ.  She has

been told this by ENT and I reinforced to her that that is what

she has and she will go ahead with a dental visit that she had

planned.  However, she has other medical problems which I will

deal with until she sees you.  At her last visit, there was a

question of PMR and she had ""25 shots"" of steroids but I have not

given her steroids and she has done reasonably well.  However,

she does have a history of a recent mild anemia but has diabetes,

hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and medications include

metformin, verapamil 250 b.i.d., Avapro 150 q.d., Pravachol 20

q.d., Bumex, Bentyl, Prilosec and Allegra.



Physical examination today reveals left TMJ pain which reproduces

her pain.  She had had no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  HEENT

was otherwise unremarkable.  I obtained blood studies which

revealed a blood sugar of 208, abnormal LFTs with an AST of 62

and ALT of 58, normal ferritin B12 and folic acid, TSH of 8.8

with thyroid antibodies pending, urine microalbumin/creatinine of

14.5 and a CBC which had anemia with a hematocrit of 32.9.  A1c

pending.  A protein electrophoresis is pending and urinalysis did

not reveal proteinuria or sediment.  HBsAG and HCV are pending as

well.



I will be in touch with her regarding these results.  I was

wondering if you could see her sooner than September because of

these abnormalities outlined.  Thanks for letting me participate

in her care.



Sincerely yours,



Dictated By: Miguel Ames

(449) 515-0294





REASON FOR VISIT:  Follow up cholesterol and new problem of chest

pain.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Gerald is a 61-year-old patient

with history of diabetes, hypertension, elevated lipids,

hypothyroidism and I now have available old records from previous

doctor, Yesenia Olive.  The following issues addressed:

1.  Diabetes:  She is currently feeling well and denies any

symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia.  Maintained on Glucophage

1000 mg b.i.d.  Blood sugar testing at home once or twice a day

is around 120.  We will be obtaining glycohemoglobin level today.

 Has ophthalmological exam scheduled.

2.  Elevated cholesterol:  With her diabetes, her target LDL will

be less than a 100.  She is maintained on Pravachol 40 mg a day

and LDL from 09/15/83 was 154 with a total cholesterol of 256. 

We will initiate Zetia to add to the Pravachol.

3.  Hypothyroidism:  Maintained on Levoxyl and TSH level is

acceptable at 3.93 with a T4 of 8.5.

4.  Hypertension:  Maintained on Avapro and verapamil and blood

pressure is currently acceptable.

5.  Question of rheumatological disease, elevated sedimentation

rate, diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica has been considered in

the past.  No new symptoms of muscle aches, but now report a

history of recent chest pain.

6.  Exercise-induced chest pain.  The patient has noted over the

past month that she gets a pressure sensation in her mid chest

when she is walking after about 20 minutes of exertion.  This

subsides when she stops and rests for a while.  This has been

reproduced for the last three times she has taken a walk with her

husband.  Review of records from Dr. Olive show that she had

thallium stress test 12/26/79 achieving 85% of maximum predicted

heart rate with a workload of 10.1 minutes.  EKG showed 1 mm ST

depression in leads II and V4 through 6.  The thallium scan

showed slight apical ischemia and mild ischemia in the anterior

walls suggesting minimal ischemia in the left anterior descending

artery distribution.  She does not recall having symptoms at that

time.  Denies palpitations, sweats or shortness of breath with

chest discomfort.  There are some radiation into both shoulders

and neck.  Multiple cardiac risk factors include elevated lipids,

diabetes, hypertension and postmenopausal.



CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Levoxyl 50 mcg q.d., Pravachol 40 mg h.s.,

Prilosec 20 mg q.d., Flexeril 10 mg q.d., Bumex 2 mg q.d., Avapro

150 mg q.d., Verapamil of 240 mg b.i.d. and Glucophage 500 mg two

tabs b.i.d.



DRUG ALLERGIES:  None.



SOCIAL HISTORY:  director/midwife for Iowa Clinic in Temescal Valley.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies abdominal pain, change in bowel

habits, fevers, sweats chills, weight loss; otherwise, as above.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She appears in no distress.  Temperature

of 97.8 degrees, BP 130/70 and pulse is 70.  Pupils are equal,

round and reactive.  Conjunctivae clear. Sclerae anicteric. 

Oropharynx benign.  Neck is supple.  No neck vein distention. 

Thyroid is not palpable.  Chest is clear to percussion and

auscultation.  Heart:  Regular rhythm, S1, S2 and no murmur, rub,

thrill or gallop.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, active bowel sounds

and no organomegaly.  Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or

edema.  Neurophysiologic:  EKG shows normal sinus rhythm.  No

abnormal complex.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1.  Diabetes.  We will check her glycohemoglobin and assure she

has had an ophthalmologic follow up.  Maintain Glucophage.

2.  Elevated cholesterol.  Add Zetia 10 mg q.d.

3.  Chest pain.  Symptoms certainly suggest ischemia.  I have

contacted Dr. Ng in Cardiology and he is arranging for an

ETT MIBI and a cardiology consult.  I prescribed nitroglycerin

1/150 to use sublingual q.5minutes. x 3 for chest

discomfort and she will limit exercise until ETT is accomplished.

 Suspect she might need catheterization and hesitant to add

beta-blocker because of high-dose verapamil and risk of inducing

heart block.

4.  Hypothyroidism:  Adequate replacement dose on current

Levoxyl.  The patient will see me back in four weeks' time and

cardiac workup to be arranged for early next week.

(449) 515-0294



REASON FOR VISIT:  Follow up coronary disease and diabetes.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:

1.  The patient underwent an angioplasty on 10/07/83 and comes in

today having just had a stress test.  Stress test showed that she

was able to do a standard Bruce protocol for 7 minutes 34 seconds

achieving maximal heart rate of 116, peak blood pressure 122/60,

stopped for fatigue.  Immediately after exercise, she did have

some substernal chest pain, resolved 3 minutes into recovery. 

There were no EKG changes.  The patient reports that she has been

walking and has resumed her normal pre-hospitalization exercise

level and does not have any chest discomfort with walk, which had

precipitated the hospitalization initially.  She is looking into

cardiac rehab program but is not sure that she needs to do this. 

She feels very comfortable with her current exercise regimen. 

She has been careful with her eating and feels she is living a

healthy lifestyle.  She has returned to work.  She has follow up

scheduled with Dr. Schaefer in two days' time.

2.  Diabetes:  At last visit, I had added glyburide 5 mg to her

Glucophage 2000 mg a day.  She monitors blood sugars but only in

the morning.  Evening blood sugars are mostly in 90s to low 100s.

 However, at times during the day, she feels hypoglycemically

sweating and abdominal discomfort.  She has never actually

checked her blood sugar during these episodes as they tend to

occur at work.  She has not had any fainting or dizziness.

3.  Elevated cholesterol, is tolerating Zetia.

4.  Hypertension.  At last visit, we decreased her Avapro dose

because her blood pressure was quite low at 100/64, and

currently, she feels somewhat less fatigued.



CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glyburide 5 mg q.d., Plavix 75 mg q.d.,

atenolol 50 mg q.d., Zetia 10 mg q.d., levoxyl 50 mcg q.d.,

Prilosec 20 mg q.d., Flexeril 10 mg q.d., Bumex 2 mg q.d.,

Pravachol 20 mg two tablets q.h.s., Avapro 75 mg q.d., Glucophage

500 mg two tablets b.i.d., and enteric-coated aspirin.



DRUG ALLERGIES:  None.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies chest pain, palpitation, shortness

of breath, abdominal pain, or joint pain.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She appears in excellent health and in

good spirits.  Weight is 145, blood pressure 120/68, and pulse is

70 and regular.  Conjunctivae are clear.  Sclerae are anicteric. 

Neck is supple.  No neck vein distention.  Chest is clear to

percussion and auscultation.  Heart: Regular rhythm.  S1 and S2. 

No murmur, rub, thrill, or gallop.  Extremities are without

clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1.  Coronary disease, doing well, status post recent angioplasty

with stenting.  Maintaining current medications of Dr. Schaefer. 

At this point, I am not sure that she actually does need cardiac

rehab, and we will defer that decision to him.

2.  Diabetes, seems as though her control is 

impressive, perhaps with recent change in her diet.  We will

discontinue the glyburide and follow up in 4 weeks.

3.  Elevated cholesterol.  We will check on lipid status in four

weeks' time.  On current medications with target of LDL less than

100.

4.  Hypertension.  Blood pressure acceptable on current medical

regimen.

THE SPECIALTY HOSPITAL OF AUSTIN

CLINIC NOTE 

Victor Lujan
SMH#:  018-92-33
March 25, 2073


DIAGNOSIS:

Bilateral hand numbness and pain, recurrent carpal tunnel syndrome.

SUBJECTIVE:

The patient is a 54-year-old right-hand dominant male with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus and renal failure requiring hemodialysis, who was has had bilateral hand numbness for several years, but getting worse within the last year or so.  The patient states that he has had past carpal tunnel release and trigger finger release of the bilateral hand and the symptoms that he is feeling now is somewhat similar 2-10 years ago appearance of symptoms.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:

Bilateral eye surgeries, right shoulder surgeries, and bilateral carpal tunnel surgery as mentioned above.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:

Multiple antibiotics including isoniazid, doxycycline, insulin, Cardura, Glucophage, Elavil, and Biaxin.  Please note that the patient is hepatitis C positive and hepatitis B positive.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

On today s examination, the patient was noted to have a fairly long carpal tunnel scar on bilateral hands extending all the way to the volar wrist level.  Long finger and right index finger scar at the base at the MP joint level is noted, the fourth trigger release, which was performed in 2062 as well.  The patient has rather stiff fingers overall with inability to fully flex the fingers all the way to the thumb space.  There is no locking or triggering, but fairly extensive stiffness involving the flexor tendon was noted.  Durkan s test was positive and Phalen s test was positive as well.  However, abductor pollicis brevis function is intact.  Other examination demonstrated some noticeable decrease in size of the muscle with some prominence of the vasculature on the radial side of the left hand, but otherwise normal examination.

IMPRESSION:

As above.

PLAN:

My recommendation is that patient undergo very vigorous assessment for the median nerve function.  In addition to this, I would like to actually consider providing him with the stretching exercises and flexion exercises as well as passive range of motion of the fingers.  It may be a little to early to consider this option until he returns with the result of EMG nerve conduction study.

Chief complaint

Chest pain



History of present illness

54 year old man with DM1 for >40 years, ESRD on HD, CAD, s/p PCI at VHOC and Sipher stent to LAD (100% lesion) on 4/10. Discharged on heart failure regimen. Developed chest pain last night, pleuritic, different than previous CP. No ECG changes noted in EW, went to Alina Medical where symptoms changed abruptly to 8/10 SSC pressure that was similar to pain experienced at VHOC admission.ECG showed biphasic TWI in anterior precordium V1-V3, and    saddle-shaped    T waves, ST elevations in II/III/aVF. Troponin mildly elevated at 0.2. Patient moved to cath lab for urgent re-look.



In the cath lab, found a widely patent LAD stent with post-stend 40% eccentric plaque. D1 ostial pinch from stent. RCA and LCx patent. No intervention. Transferred to SDU. Currently without chest pain, pressure or discomfort.

Conclusion:     

 

1. Normal left ventricular size with moderate concentric left ventricular

   hypertrophy.  Overall systolic function is mildly reduced with an estimated

   ejection fraction of 42%.  There is severe anterior and anteroseptal

   hypokinesis, extending from base to apex.  No left ventricular thombus is

   detected.  

2. Normal right ventricular size and systolic function.

3. Borderline left atrial enlargement.  Normal right atrial size.

4. The aortic valve is trileaflet with normal leaflet excursion.  No

   significant aortic stenosis or insufficiency is detected.  

5. The aortic root appears normal in size.

6. The mitral valve appears morphologically normal, without prolapse.  There is

   trace mitral regurgitation.   

7. Normal tricuspid valve, without detected regurgitation.  Right ventricular

   systolic pressure could not be estimated due to insufficient tricuspid

   regurgitation.

8. There is no significant pulmonic insufficiency.

9. No significant pericardial effusion.  The inferior vena cava appears normal.

EKG:  NSR 72 with TWF in I and TWI in L unchanged from 9/18



Impression: 

55 yo male with multiple medical problems presents from rehab facility with recurrence of shaking activity. His current exam is c/w encephalopathy with no focal neurological deficits. The patient has multiple reasons to be encephalopathic including renal insufficiency, opiate withdrawal or hypertensive encephalopathy. He does not appear to be having seizures because his movements are not rhythmic and are altered during interactions with examiners.

 

Recommendations: 

-   check UA, NH3

-   lower systolic blood pressure to below 200, e.g. with Labetalol.

-   Give 2g MgSO4 (given renal insuff), follow Mg bid and dose Mg bid to keep level at high end of normal.

-  Check EEG to assess for epileptiform activity

-  Check MRI/A to assess for posterior leukoencephalopathy



This case was discussed with the ED neurology senior resident Dr Benjamin Iles 



Thank you for this interesting consult.

CC   slurred speech, L hand tingling



HPI

50 yo RHM  presents after episode of L hand tingling and slurred speech. He was in his usual state of health when he woke up at 8 am. At around 10 am he told his son that he was not feeling well and went to bed. He reports that his speech was normal at that time. At 11:30 his wife called him and his speech was slurred. He was able to say real words but they were slurred and almost unintelligible. He also had L hand tingling. The slurred speech and tingling resolved at 12:15 pm. He denies weakness, diplopia, difficulty swallowing, headache, vertigo, chest pain, palpitations.



One week ago, while he was on vacation in Chincoteague, he had a transient episode of slurred speech. He reports that as he was walking to the bathroom, he suddenly felt lightheaded and fell. He had slurred speech and difficulty standing up but no focal weakness. The episode lasted minutes.

	FORT WASHINGTON HOSPITAL

	



	Reason for visit:

   consulted by Dr Dunham for continuity of care s/p cabg



	Interval History:

   This 53 yo male was referred with DM and CAD who today underwent CABG and CEA with Dr Dunham. Specifically he had: CABG x 3;  LIMA: Pedicle (IMA) to LAD-Mid Saphenous Vein: Ascending Aorta to Diagonal-2nd Saphenous Vein: Ascending Aorta to Diagonal-3rd; Coronary Endarterectomy.



He was in his USOH until several months ago when he first noticed lower extremity edema and activity intolerance. Symptoms waxed and waned, but eventually progressed so he was experiencing daily SOB and fatigue with usual daily activities such as walking or working around his home, and worsening LE edema up to his knees. He sought evaluation from his PCP 3 weeks ago was and found to have severe cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 25% on stress-MIBI. There was global hypokinesis. Perfusion images suggest a small distal anteroapical scar and moderately dilated LV (both new since 2076). There was no definite evidence of ischemia, although it is noted the patient was unable to achieve 85% MPHR due to poor activity tolerance. 



He was started on Coreg, as well as Lasix which has been uptitrated from 20 to 60mg qd, with subsequent 12-14 lbs weight loss. His lower extremity edema is markedly improved, and activity tolerance is moderately improved. He can perform basic ADLs such as dressing and bathing without difficulty. Walking, especially inclines, climbing stairs, and carrying parcels will cause SOB. He still feels fatigued throughout the day.

Patient:  Eubanks, Larry
MRN:  7744323
DOB:    10/03/2080
Admit Date:  01/10/49
PCP:  Talbert, Nicholas	(783)508-2821
Sources:  Patient, wife, reliable; past medical records from Pennsylvania Hospital

CC:  chest pain

HPI:
Mr. Eubanks is a 68 year-old man with hypertension, mild diabetes mellitus type II, and gout who presents with 2 hours of burning chest pain prominent in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of the back.  

In addition to HTN and DM, Mr. Eubanks    cardiac risk factors include a family history of CAD (brother, sister) and prior history of mild, spontaneously resolving chest pain in early 2147.  He received a cardiac workup for the chest pain including baseline EKG, exercise tolerance test, and Myoview study.  Baseline EKG was unremarkable with normal sinus rhythm but the ETT was positive with inverted T waves, ST segment downsloping depressions in the anterolateral and inferior leads, and PVC   s in recovery.  The patient had no chest pain and good exercise capacity during the ETT, which was terminated after 9 minutes because of leg fatigue.  On the Myoview study, a small area of ischemia with possibly minimal scaring was noted in the inferior wall although wall motion was normal.  Estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was 62%.  A subsequent exercise echo was normal.  Baseline blood pressures at the time of the workup measured 160/68 with systolic pressures noted as high as 180.  His blood pressure has been since controlled on atenolol and was measured per patient account to be around 148/80 at his most recent visit to his PCP in August.  Hemoglobin A1C in 2147 was 6.2 and diabetes has been managed with only diet.   He was previously using daily aspirin but stopped in October 2148 for a dermatologic surgery and did not restart.  

Mr. Eubanks was in his usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission when he developed two episodes of low grade chest pain, once in the morning and once in the evening.  These episodes lasted only 1-2 minutes, and seemed to him to be related to his ongoing issues with gout.  The chest pain was not associated with shortness of breath and seemed to improve with indomethacin, which he typically takes for acute exacerbations of gout.  His course over the next two days was unremarkable and he went to bed comfortable the night prior to admission.  He was awakened near 3 am by 8/10 burning chest pain and pressure in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of his back but not to the neck or jaw.  Associated with the chest pain were chills and a feeling of increased heart rate although the patient denies shortness of breath, sweating, nausea or vomiting, headache, lightheadedness, fever, or vision changes.  The pain persisted for 2 hours without improvement or alleviating factors, prompting the patient to have his wife drive him to BBH ED from his Cheney home.  

Review of systems was positive for polyuria, increased thirst, mild non-productive cough, post-nasal drip, and intermittent mild diarrhea in past months.  The patient denies recent or past history of edema, GERD, claudication, clots, hemoptysis, hematemesis, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, wheezing, fatigue, appetite or weight changes, or night sweats.  

In the emergency department, the patient was given aspirin, lopressor, sublingual nitroglycerin, and 2L O2 by nasal cannula, and chest pain subsequently resolved.  EKG on presentation showed a poor baseline in sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy.  Subsequent EKG   s revealed continued PVC   s and PAC   s with biphasic T-waves in V4-5.  A chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia or acute CHF and showed no evidence of widened mediastinum.  CT scans with and without contrast which were negative for aortic dissection.  Cardiac enzymes x 2 sets were negative, but D-dimer was elevated at 816.  Stool sample was guiac positive, although CBC was stable with HCT 44.6.

Diagnostic Studies:
EKG (01/10/49):    Serial studies.  Normal sinus rhythm with multiple PVC   s, evolving to TWI in V4-V5
CXR (01/10/49):	   No acute CHF or pneumonia.  Subsegmental atelectasis involving the right lower lung.
CT (01/10/49):  With and without contrast.   No evidence of aortic dissection.  5 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule, for which three month follow up chest CT is recommended to exclude malignancy.  Choelithiasis without cholecystitis.  Punctate calcification in the left kidney, without evidence for hydroureteralnephrosis, likely vascular, though renal calculus is possible.

Assessment:

Mr. Eubanks is a 68 year-old man with HTN, DM II, and gout, who presents with 2 hours of severe chest pain.  The differential for chest pain is broad and includes cardiac ischemia, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolus, bronchitis, pleurisy, GERD/esophageal spasm, musculoskeletal/chest wall pain, and anxiety.  The sudden onset of severe chest pain, awaking him from sleep, raises the probability of an acute cardiac or pulmonary event such as MI, aortic dissection, or PE.  The patient has elevated D-Dimer but otherwise lacks physical exam findings (dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, tachypnea, signs of DVT) or CT/CTA imaging features consistent with pulmonary embolism.  The patient   s HTN is a risk factor for aortic dissection, but this diagnosis can be ruled out by negative CXR and CTA scans, which have 80     95% sensitivity.  In addition, he lacks a number of other clinical manifestations of dissection, including syncope, pulse deficits, and new murmur.  The distribution of the pain is anginal in distribution and is relieved by nitroglycerin + aspirin.  Moreover, the patient has had two similar but less severe attacks a few days ago, and has multiple cardiac risk factors.  This makes unstable angina or myocardial infarction the most likely diagnosis.  
EKG changes lacked ST segment elevation, although T-wave inversions were present in some leads.   The patient   s cardiac enzymes were negative from the ED x 2 sets with a third troponin negative on the floor.  The patient may have either a non-ST elevation MI or unstable angina.  The plan will be to continue monitoring closely for chest pain and EKG changes, with the next step likely to involve stress test or catheterization in the morning tomorrow.  Cardiology is following closely and has provided recommendations that are incorporated into the plan.  


Plan:  

1.  Chest pain
Telemetry, cardiac monitor
Troponin, CK, CK-MB q8h x 3
LDH on next draw
EKG if chest pain reemerges or in AM if no chest pain flare
ASA 325 mg po qd
Metoprolol 37.5 mg PO q8h
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg 1 tablet prn chest pain
If chest pain continues, enzymes positive, EKG changes    add IV heparin
If chest pain flare, enzymes positive, or EKG changes, consider catheterization.  Otherwise exercise-MIBI in AM.  
NPO except MEDS after midnight; diabetic diet before midnight
Hold AM B-Blocker dose for exercise MIBI
Check in AM for fasting lipids, A1C 

2.  Ventricular Ectopy
Replete K, Mg to meet goals (K = 4.0, Mg = 2.0)

3.  GI bleed

Intern Addendum: I have interviewed and examined the pt with the medical student. In brief, the pt is a 67M w HTN gout and DM who woke up at 3am today with chest pressure and pain that radiated to both arms. He did feel slightly SOB but there was no N, V, diaphoresis or lightheadedness at this time. The episode lasted less than one minute and he felt better after he took indomethacin. Upon further questioning, he thinks he had two similar episodes last week. He has not had any DOE, PND, or LE edema. He does recall having chest pressure and chest pain in Feb 2147 when he had a    cardiac evaluation    at the Pennsylvania Hospital. He does not know the details of the workup. Of note the pt does not smoke, is not on ASA, and has several family members with CAD but no men <55 or women<65. He is on atenolol     but unsure of the dose. 
In the ED, he did have some chest pain but it was relieved after 1 nitro. HR was 85 and BP 135/82. He was given ASA and a BB. Initially, his EKG was read as normal but later the T waves became biphasic in leads V4-6. Repeat EKGs when he was chest pain free, showed flipped Ts in V4-6. There were no old EKGs available for comparison. He was seen by cardiology who recommended holding off on heparin bolus as he was found to be guaiac + (Hct 44). A dissection protocol CT was performed and was neg for dissection and for a central PE. (the ddimer was elevated). His first two sets of cardiac enzymes were negative and he was sent to the floor for further evaluation. On exam, he was in NAD and was CP free. Heart was RRR, lungs CTAB and he had no lower extremity edema. ASA and BB were cont. The third set of cardiac enzymes came back negative and the pt was scheduled for a stress test. However, the patient did experience some chest discomfort this morning and therefore cardiology felt it was best to take him to cath instead. This is planned for this morning. Please note this pt is allergic to Allopurinol.

	Reason for visit:

   Mr. Eubanks is a 68 yo man w/ recently diagnosed CAD s/p LAD stent.



	Interval History:

   Mr Eubanks presents for hospital followup after presenting to BBH in January 2149 w/ after he developed 2 episodes of chest pain lasting 1-2 minutes each and not associated with any symptoms.  On the morning of admission, patient developed more severe chest pain and pressure radiating to both arms and back.  Pain persisted for 2 hours, prompting the patient to present to the BBH ED for further care. In the ED, patient was treated with ASA, metoprolol, sl NTG, and chest pain resolved. EKGs showed biphasic T-waves in V4-5.  CT scan was negative for aortic dissection or other acute pathology.  Cardiac markers were negative.  Patient was admitted to the Internal Medicine service for further management. Of note, at Pennsylvania Hospital, patient had a positive ETTMIBI showing fixed + mild reversible defect in the inferoapical region in 2/47, followed up with normal exercise echo in 5/47.



On first night of admission, patient developed recurrent chest pain when going to the bathroom.  Because of his risk factors for disease, the decision was made to proceed directly to cardiac catheterization. In the cath lab, patient was found to have multivessel CAD with an LAD culprit.  He received 3xCypher stents to the mid and distal LAD with residual flow limitation.  RCA with moderate disease.  LCx with distal disease.  

Patient was transferred to the SDU for further care.He was started on beta-blockers and ace-inhibition, and tolerated these medications well.  He was evaluated for cardiac rehab. Of note, patient was informed of the pulmonary nodule located on CT scan and the need for follow-up CT in 3 months.

Murfreesboro, UT  97331

RE:  Rivers, Ida 
MRN: 71701456 
DOV: 06/19/64

Dear Dr. Ito,

Ida was seen back today for evaluation of Sjogren's as well as left wrist 
pain.  Her Sjogren's has been reasonably stable.  She still remains with 
difficulty in controlling her blood sugar.  She has continued difficulty with 
her oral cavity.  She has had no extraglandular symptoms -- specifically, 
polyneuropathy, myopathy, or purpura.

She uses artificial tears and saliva.  She remains on insulin and estrogens.

She has a one-week history of pain and swelling of her left wrist.  She was 
seen at the Graduate Hospital Emergency Room several days ago.  Radiographs of the 
wrist show chondrocalcinosis.  She was started on Motrin with some response 
but still has active symptoms.  She is wearing a splint.

Today on exam, she is afebrile.  There was OA involving the DIP joints.  PIPs 
and MCPs were nontender.  The left wrist showed swelling and heat with 
diminished motion.  Right wrist showed full range of motion.  Elbows, 
shoulders, hips, knees, ankles, and feet did not show active synovitis.  
There was no adenopathy and lungs were clear.

I aspirated the left wrist under sterile technique.  No fluid was obtained.  
I injected it with 40 mg of Depo-Medrol.

Clinically, I think she has had pseudogout.  She has chondrocalcinosis on 
radiograph and has a clinical picture consistent with crystal disease.  In 
addition, she has primary Sjogren's.  The two diseases are unrelated.

In addition to injection of her wrist, I switched her from Motrin to Celebrex 
200 mg twice a day due to side effect profile issues.  She should probably 
take that for about five to seven days.  Side effects were reviewed.

I would like to see her back in four months.  She will be returning to you 
for further care in the interim.

ADDENDUM:  At her next visit, I will want her to check her calcium and 
thyroid status since that can be associated with CPPD disease.

With best wishes,

1.	Sjogren's.
2.	Diabetes.

HPI:  Is now getting her diabetes care through the HMC.  Very impressed by 
their detail.  Is getting better control for blood sugar.

Is getting physical therapy for her knee where she has internal derangement.  
Is wearing a brace which appears to help her instability.

Noting some discomfort involving her feet.  Has a history of arterial 
insufficiency.

Remains on colchicine 0.6 per day for pseudogout and has had no recurrent 
episodes.

Sjogren's the same, no change in symptoms.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  OA of DIP and PIP joints and thumbs.  No active 
synovitis of MCP joints, wrists, elbows, shoulders, or hips.  Right knee: 
small cool effusion, instability noted, quadriceps laxity noted.  Left knee: 
full motion.  Ankles and feet nontender.  Proximal muscle strength normal.  
Peripheral pulses diminished, particularly left foot, intact right.

ASSESSMENT:  
1.	Sjogren's.
2.	Chondrocalcinosis with probable pseudogout.
3.	Diabetes.
4.	Internal derangement.
5.	Vascular insufficiency.

PLAN:  
1.	Baby aspirin.
2.	Needs Primary Care Doctor.

SDU JAR Admit Note



Name:	Rivers, Ida	

MR: 468 48 69	

Date of Admission: 06/17/66



Cardiologist: Valdivia



CC: 73 yo woman with h/o Sjogren's syndrome, Diabetes (?Type I), vascular insufficiency who now presents with syncopal episode.

		

HPI:  Ms Rivers was in her USOH until the morning of admission, when she went into the city to buy some buttons and pay a bill at ViewSonic.  She noted that she was not feeling well throughout the morning, and she felt as if she may need to eat something.  However, because she did not have her insulin and blood sugar monitoring equipment, she decided not to eat.  She continued to feel poorly (she is somewhat vague on symptoms but reports feeling that her chest was congested and that she may have had some palpitations and felt chilled).  She saw a police cruiser, and walked over to it with the intention of getting help.  When she arrived, there was no one in the car, and she leaned forward to rest her head on the front of the car.  This is the last thing she remembered; when she awoke, she was surrounded by people.  She was told that she had falled backwards and hit the back of her head.  When EMS found her, she was confused, making repetitive statements, and stating that she had pain in her occiput that radiated down her neck.  When she arrived at the FMH ED, her blood pressure was 213/97 HR 84 RR20 O2 sat 99% RA Temp 97.3.  She received Labetolol 20 iv, Toradol 30 mg iv, ASA 325 mg and Tylenol 1000 mg po x 1.  Her mental status cleared somewhat, and her blood pressure came down to 130s/80s.  She did have one episode of emesis, during which her HR was noted to transiently dip to the 40s (not captured on the monitor); spontaneously recovered to the 60s.

She had a C-spine series and head CT which were negative for acute process, and a CXR which was negative except for R shoulder not well-visualized on CXR.  She was noted to have some superficial bleeding of her posterior scalp, but no obvious laceration.  She was admitted to the SDU because of the episode of bradycardia.

FREEPORT MEMORIAL HOSPITAL



History of present illness   Ms Rivers was hospitalized 1/22-1/24/67 after presenting to ER with left shoulder pain that evolved to an ache radiating to her chest and forearm, associated with nausea, diaphoresis, dizziness.  In the ER, the pain was characterized as mechanical, but was also relieved by SLNTG (which however precipitated hypotension, brady to 30s). EKG showed only ? slight exaggeration of baseline 1mm ST elevation in V2, V3.  She was heparinized and admitted to SDU.  R/O by serial markers.  Cardiac cath on the day after admission showed a tight RCA (with unclear relationship to anterior ischemia seen on prior stress). She is now s/p Cypher stent, with plans for at least three months of Plavix.



Other issues:

- HgbA1c drawn during office visit was 11.3.

Address:  26 Burrit St, Marlborough, WI 21145
 
First visit for this 51-year-old white male.
 
1.  Gout.  This has been present for 7 years.  Evaluated at Mary by
Dr. Farrar.  Treated with Colchicine.  He cut down the amount of
organ meats and red meat that he had been eating at the time.  He has
not had any alcohol for 11 years.  Strong family history in his father
and all his brothers.  Continues to have 4 or 5 relatively mild flares
a year which are frequently attributable to forgetting to take the
Colchicine.
 
PMH:  Tonsillectomy.  Cervical radiculitis.  He is a recovering
alcoholic.  No alcohol for 11 years.  Hypertension when he was
drinking.  Hidradenitis.  
 
Meds:  Colchicine 0.6 mg q.d.  
 
ALL:  None.
 
FH:  Father died at 57 from an MI.  Mother at 60 in her sleep. 
Brothers have gout, one has hypertension.
 
SH:  Married for the second time.  His wife is Emily Ippolito another
patient of mine.  They will have been married for one year in May. 
He works as a Patternmaker for McCall in Enid.  He averages 1 1/2
packs of cigarettes a day for the last 35 years.  No alcohol.  No drugs
or HIV exposure.
 
ROS:  Bifocals. Slightly decreased hearing in the left ear.  No chest
pain.  Has a chronic AM cough bringing up 1/4 cup of phlegm daily.  He
occasionally plays tennis and bicycles.  He believes his cholesterol
was 170.  Does like high cholesterol food but has cut back because his
wife has a problem.  He uses seat belts.
 
On physical examination he is a very pleasant large white male.  His
weight is 222 lbs., blood pressure 128/88, heart rate 72.  HEENT -
EOMI, PERL, fundi negative.  Cerumen impacted against the TM's.  Benign
oral cavity examination.  No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Lungs
clear.  No murmurs or gallops.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  No testicular
masses or hernias.  Normal prostate, guaiac negative stool.   Absent
distal pulses.  2+ femoral pulses without any bruits.  1+ reflexes.  No
swelling or tenderness over the first MTP's.  Neurologic exam shows
hearing decreased to watch tick bilaterally.  Air conduction is greater
than bone.  Weber is not lateralized.  
 
Impressions and plans:  1.  Gout.  It sounds like this is really not
much of a problem when he remembers to take the Colchicine.  I
encouraged him to make this a regular habit.  We will check a random
uric acid level.
 
2.  Cardiac risk factors.  He is a male with a very positive family
history who is a smoker.  He has significant cardiac risk factors.  We
spent a long time talking about smoking today.  At his request I gave
him a prescription for Nicoderm patches.  He will start at 21 mg for
six weeks and then move to 14 mg for 2 weeks and 7 mg for 2 weeks.  We
will check a cholesterol and he should be less than 200 given his risk
factors.  I pointed out to him his evidence by history of chronic
bronchitis and of peripheral vascular disease.  I think he found this
sobering.
 
3.  General health.  We discussed exercise, cholesterol and seat belts.
We also discussed the use of Q-Tips which I think may also be a
significant contributing factor to his decreased hearing and the
impaction of cerumen.  I recommended ear drops.  We can have him tested
formally when he becomes interested in intervention.

Gregg, Lloyd
MR #657-72-75-7
06/14/80
 
A follow up visit of a 57-year-old white male.  Unfortunately, he
arrived 24 hours late.  
 
He is gradually recovering from a recent flare of his COPD.  This
started with an upper respiratory infection.  He called over the
weekend and was started on prednisone.  He continued to have a
stuttering course over the course of that following week and came
to urgent care the following weekend.  There he was treated with
nebulizers.  He reports that today he was finally able to blow 350
on his peak flow meter.  He is still bringing up lots of junk.  His
gout has been quiescent.  
 
Medications:  Albuterol.  Azmacort.  Colchicine.  Enalapril.  
 
Allergies:  None.
 
Social History:  Married.  His adoption of a 10-year-old girl named
Xiao has been finalized.  He is employed as a sales representative and that
requires a lot of lifting and carrying.  He quit smoking three and
a half years ago.  He drinks no alcohol.
 
Physical Examination:  Looks well.  His weight is 222 pounds.  His
blood pressure is 124/82.  Pulse 76.  HEENT:  EOMI.  No scleral
icterus.  No lymphadenopathy.  His lungs are completely clear
posteriorly and anteriorly.  Distant heart sounds without any
audible murmurs.  Benign abdomen without any hepatomegaly.  No
rectal masses.  Normal prostate.  Guaiac negative stool.  No pedal
edema.  
 
Oxygen saturation on room air is 97 percent.  Peak flow is 320. 
 
Impression: 
1.  COPD.  We discussed this at length.  I think the crucial
component to his treatment will be to anticipate when he is going
to have a flare and responding quickly in a preventative fashion. 
We will have him check his peak flows at the same time every day. 
When he is feeling well his peak flows are always in the 350 range
and he reports that they never go to 300.  When it hits 300 he
should call me or if it is the weekend, he should start immediately
on prednisone 40 mg a day.  
2.  Gout.  Doing well on colchicine.  
3.  Hypertension.  Well controlled.  I will check a creatinine.
4.  General health.  We will check a cholesterol.  His cholesterols
have been good in the past but he has a slightly low HDL.

RE: Lloyd Gregg 

    MR#65772757

 

Dear Xzavior, 

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Lloyd Gregg for follow

up of his emphysema.

 

The patient reports that he continues to lead a very

active lifestyle working as a sales representative roughly 10 hours

a day, frequently lifting 60 pound boxes.  When he

returns home from work he cooks dinner and this

combined with his work schedule and picking up his

daughter from school and walking the dog has prohibited

him from a regular exercise program.  Needless to say,

he has remained active.  He is not limited in these

activities by his respiratory function with the

exception of some periodic exacerbation of dyspnea with

heavy lifting.  He uses albuterol during these

instances anywhere between 0 and 2 to 3 times per day. 

His usual peak expiratory flow rate is roughly 300-350

liters per minute.  He knows that when his PEFR falls

to below 250 for 3 days in a row to contact you for

advice as well as burst of prednisone and he has had 1

burst of prednisone since our last visit in April.

 

His medical regimen is notable for Flovent 220

micrograms per puffs, 2 puffs twice a day, Serevent MDI

2 puffs twice a day, Allopurinol, colchicine, Vasotec

and the albuterol as mentioned above. 

 

RE: Lloyd Gregg            -2-  November 29,2083 

    MR#65772757

 

The patient's review of systems is notable for the absence of

fevers, chills, sweats, chest discomfort, symptoms of GERD,

change in his bowel or bladder habits or weight.  He does

continue to have nearly continuous post nasal drip which leads to

frequent clearing of his throat and occasional cough.  There is

no hemoptysis or significant sputum production.

 

On physical exam, he appears well, is in no respiratory distress. 

NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI, AS, pink conjunctiva.  TM's are clear with

normal light reflexes bilaterally.  His nasal mucosa is notable

for mild erythema bilaterally with a clear nasal discharge.  No

significant LAN in the cervical or supraclavicular axillary

chains.  Chest exam reveals an increased AP diameter and

prolongation of his expiratory phase.  He has an occasional

expiratory wheeze.  There are no focal findings of consolidation

and air movement is moderate.  No significant JVD and he has a

regular rate and rhythm with an S4, S1, a normally split S2 and

there are no murmurs, rubs or S3.  Abdomen is benign without HSM,

focal tenderness or masses.  His extremities are without

clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  His weight is 223 pounds. 

Temperature 97.1 degrees, pulse 86 per minute, BP 142/82 and his

respiratory rate is 20 with a room air resting oxygen saturation

of 97 percent.

 

My impression is that the patient's severe airflow obstruction

secondary to emphysema is stable on his current medical regimen. 

I once again encouraged him to continue to lead robust and active

life.  We agreed that the current action plan for a burst of

prednisone is appropriate and I also have provided him my contact

information in the event that he cannot reach you in the midst of

a flare.  I have refilled all of his current prescriptions.  To

try and prevent him from requiring these frequent bursts of

prednisone through the winter months, we have also begun

Combivent 2 puffs 4 times a day as well as Nasonex nasal spray to

be used 2 puffs in each nostril once a day.  We talked about

vaccinations and he reported that he has recently received the

influenza vaccine and he has previously received the pneumonia

vaccine.

 

Thank you for allowing me to participate in Mr. Gregg's care. 

He will follow up with us on a routine basis in 6 month's time

but will contact us sooner should he develop more symptoms of a

flare of his COPD.

61 yo man with CAD and PVD referred by Dr. Short for pre-operative evaluation prior to vascular surgery.



He has a long hx of ischemic ulcer of the second toe of the right foot. He was admitted to the vascular service on 8/09 and had an arteriogram that showed complete occlusion of the SFA with reconstitution of the popliteal and single vessel run off. His pre-operative EKG raised the possibility of old ASMI although it was unchanged for a number of years. He underwent dobutamine MIBI which showed a moderate area of severe ischemia in the LAD territory. His LV was normal with EF of 59%. He underwent cath which showed complete occlusion of the LAD with collaterals from a fairly large diagonal that also had a tight stenosis. There were lower grade occlusions in the RCA territory and the LCX. He had been asymptomatic. The LAD lesion was long and totalled and not felt to be amenable to angioplasty. There were no indications to have him undergo CABG so the decision was made to PTCA the diagonal lesion to improve flow to the anterior wall. He tolerated this well. Returns today feeling well and has been active painting his fence and going up and down stairs without any chest pains or unusual SOB. Has had a hematoma in the groin.



MEDICATIONS:  Serevent.  Flovent.  Enalapril.  Colchicine. Alopurinol.

Albuterol.  Viagra.

 

ALLERGIES:  None. 

 

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died at 57 after his 8th MI.  He had his

first one at age 48.  Mother had a stroke in her early 50s.  His brother, Shields,

died a miserable death with recurrent, inoperable laryngeal cancer.

 

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married.  Continues to work as a sales representative.  He

has an adopted child, Xiao who is now 14 and doing very well in school. Quit smoking and drinking a number of years ago.

 



ROS: No chest pains. Chronic shortness of breath. No bowel problems. No bladder problems. Does not exercise. Last cholesterol was  175/42.     The rest of the review of systems was negative. 



PE: General: Looks well.

================ Vital signs ================

Blood Pressure:   150/80 142/80   130/78

Pulse:   84   [Regular, Radial]

Weight:   222   [Pounds]

Skin: Chronic ischemic ulcer on the medial aspect of his second toe of the right foot.

HEENT: EOMI. PEERL. No scleral icterus. Bilateral cataracts. Benign pharynx.

Neck: No lymphadenopathy. No thyromegaly. No cartotid bruits.

Lungs: Decreased breath sounds. Wheezes.

Cor: JVP is normal. PMI is not displaced. Heart sounds barely audible No murmurs. No gallops.

Abd: Normal bowel sounds. No hepatomegaly. No splenomegaly. No masses. No tenderness.

He has a small echymosis of the left inguinal area. Bilateral femoral bruits. 1+ right femoral pulse. I cannot palpate the left pulse.

Extremities: No pedal edema. Ulcer as above.



EKG done in the office shows NSR at 74. Axis 90. Normal intervals. He has Q's in V1-V2 c/w possible OASMI. He has low volts in the precordial leads c/w chronic pulmonary disease. No changes from previous.



================ Problems ================

PRE-OP EVALUATION   He has rest ischemia of the toe. He has three vessel coronary disease that is asymptomatic. There are no indications at this time to push for CABG. He underwent angioplasty to try to improve flow to the anterior wall. His EKG suggests OASMI but his ventriculogram is normal without evidence of MI and EF of 59%. There are studies showing increased risk of in-stent thrombosis, MI, death in patients who have had Plavix stopped for non-cardiac surgery within two weeks of stent. He will be beyond the two week period and Dr. Short is willing to operate on him while continuing Plavix and aspirin. I believe he is an acceptable risk for surgery.



PVD   Will need surgery for ischemic ulcer.



COPD   Doing well and is stable. Instructed to use his inhalers faithfully in the preop period.

       

GOUT    No flares this year.

      

HYPERTENSION    Better when rechecked. He gets nervous with the initial measurements.

      

IMPOTENCE         Discussed the fact that, now that he has documented CAD, there is increased risk with Viagra use. He understands that but indicates that he feels that for him personally the benefits outweigh the risks.

CARDIOLOGY

PERHAM MERITCARE CLINIC



Reason for visit:

   Ms. Neill came into the emergency room even though she was feeling fine because she insists that she wanted to see me today even though it is not an office day.  She was instructed to come to the office and I was able to see her in between catheterization cases



Interval History:

   Ms. Neill was recently evaluated at Janesville Clinic for her dyspnea.  She was concerned that her dyspnea was related to her lungs and I believe self referred to Janesville for further evaluation.  



She was found by cardiac echo there to have significant decrease in her ejection fraction to 15%.  Previously here last fall her ejection fraction measured 43%.  She had global hypokinesis.



She was hospitalized at Janesville and had an abnormal set of pulmonary function tests showing moderate restrictive disease.  She had some air trapping and was noted to have room air saturation 97% at rest, 94% with exertion.  Lower extremity ultrasound negative for DVT.  d dimer 400 rnage.  BNP elevated at 500.  VQ scan showed possible perfusion defect in the left lower lobe.  Previous CTA in the emergency room had been negative for pulmonary embolus.  Because of continued suspicion about PE she underwent pulmonary arterogram which was unremarkable.  A repeat VQ scan after a normal PA gram showed some persistence in the left lower lobe defect and ultimately it was felt that she did not have evidence of any thromboembolic pulmonary vascular disease.  Of note pulmonary artery pressure was approximately 50 at the time of PA gram.



The patient was commenced on Lasix 20mg.  Her Atenolol was changed to Toprol.



Unfortunately she does not bring with her a complete list of her medications today although she relates that she is taking:

Lasix 20mg

Toprol XL 50mg

ASA 325mg

Zestril 20mg

Lantus 10 units hs

Glucovance 2.5/500mg

Multivitamin



She relates that her dyspnea is better



She is extremely reluctant to undergo Cardiac catheterization at this time despite recommendation on my part.  She would much prefer cardiac echo and if there is improvement, continued medical therapy.





Past medical history:

   1. Diabetes

2. Hypertension

3. Hyperlipidemia

4. Sick Sinus syndrome requiring permanant pacemaker

5. cardiomypathy

6. Minimal CAD by cath 2090



Family history:

   No significant cardiac disease



Social history:

   She and her husband are doing well.  She has retired. Daughter is finished with college and Quarry Worker in the Bristow area.



Review of systems:

   Patinet is improved with regard to exertional tolerance as noted.  Denies edema, PND, orthopnea.  Still has dyspnea with walking flat ground but not until 1-2 blocks.



Physical examination:

-BP: 130/80  

-General appearance:   No acute distress.

-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.

-Heent:   Unremarkable

-Neck:   CVP 8.  No carotid bruits

-Chest:   Clear to auscultation and percussion.

-Cardiac:   S1 S2.   No significant murmurs.  PMI normal.

-Abdomen:   Obese, soft, no hepatosplenomegly

-Extremities:   Good pulses, no edema

-Neuro:   Non-focal

-Pulse: 89  



EKG:

   Atrial triggered ventricular pacing with borderline first degree AV block.



Impression:

   Ms. Neill is very reluctant regarding angiography despite a drop in her ejection fraction.



Her evaluation at Janesville Clinic for thromboembolic pulmonary disease was unremarkable.



She was found to have a markedly positive ANA at 1-1280 with a speckled pattern and single stranded DNA postive.  Further markers etc are not available to me at this time.



At this point, repeat cardiac echo at our institution will be obtained.



Depending upon the results I will again approach the patient regarding considering Cardiac catheterization although in truth her pattern in LV dysfunction is more suggestive of recurrent myocarditis/undetermined cardiomyopathy than coronary disease.



In addition, the patient relates that she stopped Lipitor due to myalgia and that she is taking a differrent cholesterol tablet at this time although once again she unable to name the medication.  She relates that she will call our office.

Head CT (): 


     CT BRAIN: No definite evidence for acute intracranial pathology.  No 

     hemorrhage, mass lesion or evidence for acute territorial infarction.

      

     Stable chronic infarct involving the left frontal lobe.

      

     CTA HEAD: Occlusion of the distal right intradural vertebral artery 

     after the takeoff of the right PICA.  Normal appearance to the left 

     vertebral artery which courses to become the basal artery without 

     evidence of occlusion or significant stenosis.  The other 

     intracranial arteries demonstrate no evidence of significant stenosis 

     or occluded segment.  No aneurysm is visualized.  

      

     CTA NECK: Moderate stenosis of the proximal right cervical vertebral 

     artery secondary to atherosclerotic disease. The other cervical 

     vessels demonstrate no significant stenosis or dissection.





ASSESSMENT / PLAN:

This 71 year-old right-handed woman with multiple medical problems who presents with subacute impaired speech fluency.  



CT confirms infarct in left frontal lobe, age-undetermined.   The distal right intradural vertebral artery occlusion is likely chronic and incidental finding.  
MRI is contraindicated due to pacemaker



-          Out of the window for acute thrombolytics

-          Hold off on oral intake until swallow evaluation
; D5NS in the meantime
-          Repeat TTE: EF 20-25% in 3/98

-          Consider starting anticoagulation if EF remains poor (pending CMF team decision); continue with ASA for now

-          Rest of the stroke evaluation per CMF team

This patient wants to transfer his care from the McCook Erie Clinic to me. He 
got 
my name from a nurse who works in the hospital.  HE is a 58 year old white 
male retired Transportation Manager with a number of issues.  
1)  He had a cyst or a mass enlarge in his R submental region which was 
excised 
at the McCook Erie Clinic.  Note from his surgeon there said the path showed 
nonkaziating granuloma.  I hope cultures are pending.  The patient does 
volunteer at a homeless shelter so could  certainly be exposed to TB or 
atypical mycobacteria.  
2)  The patient has know mitral valve prolapse, mitral regurgitation followed 
at the MEC by a cardiologist. He had a stress test in the last year that was 
benign. Never had CHF or endocarditis.  
3)  Social situation.  The patient is a sober alcoholic and sober for the 
last 
2 years however he went through divorce probably because of his alcoholism 
10 years ago and took early retirement from Brookdale Metro Systems because 
of his alcoholism. He stays sober by going to meetings and also 
volunteering at the McCook Clinic. He lives with a woman. He has good 
relations with his grown children and his grand children.  His woman friend 
is very supportive and the patient is now feeling good enough about himself 
that he is ready to try and get work full time.  Previous attempts to do so 
have resulted in failure because of his Hx of alcoholism and his premature 
retirement.
 
Family Hx. Father died at age 79 of Altzheimers and some kind of cancer ? 
throat cancer.  His mother had diabetes and coronary artery disease and she 
died of colon cancer. The patient himself had a colonoscopy within the last 
year and it was normal.  One brother and 2 sisters, one of the sisters also 
has mitral valve disease. 
 
Past medical Hx the alcoholism and he was stabbed in the L hand I think in 
2059 and that was repaired. He also had a TNA in childhood. 
 
He has no known allergies to medications.
 
The only medication he takes is Lisinopril 5 mg for blood pressure. He was 
only started on this in the last year. He also takes a vitamin a day.
 
His other significant medical complaint is erectile dysfunction.  He has 
normal libido and good sexual drive however he tends to lose erection after 
he 
has gone for a few minutes.  He can achieve vaginal penetration.  His live in 
lover has been supportive but she would like him to have better performance 
and so would he. He does wake up in the morning frequently with erections. He 
has no known Hx of diabetes.  No prolonged hypertension or vascular disease.  
 
Social Hx.  The patient eats fairly well. He walks usually a mile or so a 
day.  
He does not do any aerobic activity. He does smoke  to a pack a day and has 
for many, many years.  He does wear seat belts when he drives and does not do 
any elicit drugs.  On system review:  Weight stable.  No change in skin. He 
always had a very gravelly voice.  He has had no change in his vision. He is 
very deaf in the L ear.  He has a morning cough no hemoptysis.  Cough is 
about 
a teaspoon of white/gray sputum. He has no dyspnea on exertion.  He has no 
angina.  No palpitations.  No presyncope or syncope.  NO claudication. He has 
no dysphagia. He has no epigastric discomfort.  No change in his bowel 
movements and no rectal bleeding.  He has no claudication.  No edema and no 
joint pains. No headaches and no low back pain.  No long bone pain.  He has 
no 
heat or cold intolerance.  He has no easy bruisability.  
 
PE: shows him to 5'7"".  155 lbs.  Skin benign.  Nails do show some early 
clubbing. No cyanosis.  Normal no AV knicking.  Flat disks. Pupils equally 
round and reactive to light and accommodation at 3 mm. Nares normal.  TMs 
normal. Hearing is markedly diminished in the L ear. Head is normal cephalic. 
Thyroid not enlarged.  There is the scar at the site of his excision under 
the 
mandible. No associated adenopathy on either R or L neck or axilla or the 
supraclavicular region.  He is hyperesonant to percussion.  He has distant 
breath sounds. No rales, rhonchi or wheezes. He has normal S1.  Normal S2 and 
holosystolic blowing 2-3/6 mid systolic murmur radiates best to the axilla. 
No 
radiation to the clavicles. No carotid bruits.  Jugular venous pulsation to 7 
sonometers. Abdomen is soft and non tender. There is no enlargement of the 
liver. No adeventitious masses. There is a L inguinal weakness without frank 
hernia.  Phallus uncircumsized. Testes normal. Prostate is a little difficult 
feel because he has a band around the anal sphincter which makes it difficult 
for me to get beyond but I felt probably half of his prostate and it was 
normal and smooth. Stool was guac negative. Reflexes 3+ and equal throughout 
and normal vibratory sense and touch. Normal gait and station.
 
Assessment and Plan:
 
1)  Recent rapidly growing mass under the R mandible showing nonkaziating 
granuloma.  Culture is pending and we will plant a PPD and control early 
next week. I will have him tracked down the report of this from the MEC and 
get culture reports and will get chest x-ray today both for his COPD to 
rule out a cavitary lesion.  
2)  Alcoholism now sober.
3)  Erectile dysfunction try Viagra. He was given appropriate warnings and 
instructions.  I gave him 100 mg # 7.  
4)  Mitral valve prolapse by auscultation followed by cardiologist at the MEC.
5)  We spent a long time talking about smoking cessation.  He has some 
Wellbutrin at home from when he was depressed while getting sober and I 
encouraged him to take 150 b.i.d. and we made a plan for him to try and 
quit.   I will see patient again next week to plant a PPD and then see him 
again in about a month to see how he is doing.  We will certainly check the 
chest x-ray to make sure he did not have active cavitary disease.

Mr. Ostrander is here for follow-up of his thyroid situation, however due to 
scheduling difficulties he is only having his thyroid uptake and scan 
currently.  He took the tracer and he had his first scan now and the 
testing wont be done until tomorrow.  Thyroid function tests were 
completely normal.  His chest x-ray is completely normal except for 
tracheal deviation I believe which is due to his goida.  I talked to him 
that if the nodule were cold we will need a fine needle aspirate.  I also 
said to him that he made need to see a thyroid specialist.  Though 
slightly anxious he is agreeable to this.
 
He did not bring with him the pathology final report of his lymph node 
biopsy but he was told it was a reaction to an infection and no further 
follow-up or treatment was necessary.
We then talked about smoking cessation and he and his live-in have picked 
a date namely Jun 8th to quit .I tried to give him as much encouragement 
for that as I could.

&#183; Urinalysis:  negative



&#183; Radiology: CXR:  IMPRESSION:

     Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Cardiomegaly. 

       

&#183; EKG: Regular rate, sinus rhythm, indeterminate versus right axis. Frequent PVCs, Anterior Q waves, prolonged QT



ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN: 66 yo m w/ likely new onset CHF.  Given his exam, I would favor systolic heart failure &gt; diastolic heart failure, although he has features going for both.  Features going for systolic are his widely displaced PMI and the fact that he had a mildly dilated LV on an echo in 2092.



I think he most likely has dilated cardiomyopathy 2/2 mitral regurgitation, which was moderate to severe in 2092.  His murmur is quite impressive.  Another possibility is alcoholic cardiomyopathy.  Ischemia is not out of the question given his age and risk factors. He is also a smoker.  



Another possibility is diastolic failure given his hypertension and likely diabetes.



1.        CHF &#8211; Still quite volume overloaded on exam.  Will give another dose of lasix 40 IV tonight.  Start captopril 6.25 q8 to also control BP.  Repeat echo in the am.  Strict I/Os, fluid restriction, low fat, low salt diet.  If EF is depressed, will start beta blocker, consider aldactone.

2.        Substance abuse &#8211; Will obtain Johnson Rehab consult for alcohol and cigarettes.

3.        HTN &#8211; Poorly controlled, captopril

4.        Elevated blood sugar &#8211; Will obtain fasting BSs and right for sliding scale insulin.  Will obtain HgbA1C

5.        Hyperlipidemia &#8211; LDL 128 in 2090.  Will start statin and check fasting lipid panel in am.

6.        Restless leg syndrome &#8211; Likely 2/2 iron deficiency anemia.  Will replete till ferritin &gt; 50 before treating

7.        Iron deficiency anemia &#8211; Will start iron sulfate, recheck ferritin.



F/E/N:  low salt, low fat/cholesterol diet

EDVISIT^93295529^OSTRANDER, BILL^04/22/95^OXENDINE, LAWRENCE

Seen and evaluated with resident, Dr. Castro.  I have reviewed

her note and assessment and plan, and I agree.  I have seen and

evaluated the patient myself.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old

gentleman with past medical history of alcoholism, as well as

depression.  He has had a small-bowel obstruction in the past as

well as CABG x2, PTSD, and high cholesterol, now presenting to

the Emergency Room in the setting of having been separated from

his girlfriend of 15 years secondary to his excessive alcohol use

and drinking very heavily over the last week.  He was found in a

bar intoxicated, and upon EMS arrival stated that he wanted help

with his drinking problem as well as the fact that he was

depressed without any SI or HI.  He is also stating that he has

not taken any food in the last week, just alcohol.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He is denying any chest pain, shortness of

breath, any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, any headache or blurred

vision or any fall or trauma.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  As above.

MEDICATIONS:  He is on unknown medications.

ALLERGIES:  No known allergies.

ALLERGIES:  Current heavy alcohol use.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Does smoke cigarettes, but does not use illicit

drugs.  He is a retired transporation manager, and he was previously

living with his girlfriend, but has now been living alone for the

last week.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  When he presented, he had a heart rate of

65, respiratory rate of 16, BP of 150/79, and saturating 99% on

room air.  He was afebrile at 96.7.  He was alert, interactive,

appropriate, somewhat slurred speech, but gave a good history of

signs and symptoms.  HEENT exam:  He is nonicteric with dry

mucous membranes.  Heart was regular rhythm, no murmurs.  Lungs

were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen was soft and

minimally diffusely tender.  He had no evidence of trauma and

pain to palpation in his extremities.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a patient with severe alcohol

abuse, now presenting in the setting of an alcohol binge with no

p.o. food intake.  We did send laboratory studies notable for an

elevated white count of 9 as well as hyponatremia at 124, down

from 135 previously.  Please see the resident note for full

details.  His alcohol level was 277.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  We did treat the patient with IV

fluid as well as D5.  We did give him a p.o. diet here in the

Emergency Department and we monitored him for withdrawal signs. 

In addition, we contacted social work for help with his alcohol

dependence/abuse, and he will be admitted to the Ochsner for

further management of his hyponatremia as well as his alcohol

abuse.  We also treated him with multivitamins.

DIAGNOSES:

1.  Alcohol intoxication

2.  Alcohol dependence

3.  Depression.

4.  Hyponatremia.

REPORT
     BILATERAL MAMMOGRAM
     The present study is compared to previous films.
     There are scattered fibroglandular densities.
     There is architectural distortion and skin and trabecular
     thickening involving the left breast that are consistent with post
     treatment changes.  There is no evidence of new or recurrent
     disease.
     No suspicious mass, calcifications or architectural distortion are
     identified in the right breast.  A clip and calcifications are
     noted in the upper outer quadrant from prior benign percutaneous
     biopsy.
     There is no mammographic evidence of malignancy in the right
     breast.
     

IMPRESSION

MICROBIOLOGY: None


RADIOLOGY
1. CXR: Lungs:  The lungs are satisfactorily inflated. There is increasing
prominence of the interstitium and peribronchial cuffing when compared to the prior study consistent with interval development of CHF.  Surgical clips are again noted projected over the left lower hemithorax.  No definite focal consolidation is demonstrated. Pleura:  There is no pneumothorax. The hemidiaphragms are very slightly less distinct than on the comparison study.  This could be related to the onset of parenchymal changes of CHF, but could also be related to a small amount of pleural fluid. IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with CHF.


2. Bilateral LENIs: NO EVIDENCE OF FEMORAL OR POPLITEAL DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS OF
EITHER LEG.


EKG: Normal sinus rhythm at 95. Normal axis. Normal PR, QRS, QT intervals. No ST elevations or depressions.  ? Q waves in v1, v2, v3 but also may be upslopes before the downslops. However new since 12/12/2074




ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN


Mrs. Ito is a 69F with a history of CHF (EF 40%, no home O2), DM type 2, HTN, nephritic syndrome, and 1/15/2075 R humerus ORIF presenting from Crest Nursing Home with SOB and HTN. Her exam and imaging is consistent with pulmonary edema, as she has had in the past. The precipitant of her flash pulmonary edema is less clear, however. She describes waking up acutely short of breath and was found to be profoundly hypertensive. It is possible that HTN 2/2 a change in her diet or fluid intake at rehab, ischemia, increases renin-aldo, or other cause led to flash pulmonary edema.  Conversely, however, CHF may have precipitated her HTN.
 
1. Shortness of breath/CHF: Evidence of volume overload by exam and imaging. PE also on the differential but seems less likely given improvement of resp status, negative LENIs. 
-- Lasix 40mg IV now 
-- Strict I+O
-- Daily weights
-- F/up PA/Lat
-- Continuous O2 sat monitor;Telemetry, cardiac monitor
-- f/up cardiac enzymes
-- ASA 325 qd
-- Will give Lopressor 25 Q8 and Captopril 50 Q8 for now but may need to reconsider the BB if CHF less compensated. 
-- Albuterol and atrovent for possible COPD component given tobacco history
-- Consider TTE in AM
-- Consider PFTs


2. Leukocytosis: Infection vs stress response. Patient presents with elevated WBC with 80% polys. Infectious work-up has included U/A that is negative for infection. CXR does not show evidence of focal consolidation, however may be obscured by pulmonary edema. Mental status at baseline. I am suspicious for PNA given her report of productive cough howeve do not feel pressed to treat at this time as she is afeb. 
-- Cont to follow fever curve and WBC
-- F/up PA/Lat
-- Consider addition of abx for HAP if fever, PA/lat concerning
-- F/up Blood cultures and sputum cultures
-- F/up c diff


3. Hypertension: Home HTN regimen is Atenolol 50mg QD, HCTZ 25 qday, Lisinopril 40 qday, Losartan 50 BID
-- Start Captoril 50 mg Q8 and Lopressor 25 q8 and titrate up as needed fo tight BP control 
-- Cardiac monitor


4. DM type 2: Home regimen is Metformin/Glucotrol. 
-- D/c oral agents and start Insulin SS w BID BS


5. Hematuria/Proteinuria on U/A: Consisent with prior U/A


6. Breast CA: Cont Arimidex (hormone tx)


7. HL: Cont statin


8. Depression: Cont Prozac


9. Tobacco use: Cont Chantix 0.5 mg PO QDay

ID:  T2 N 0 M X, ER/PR + Her 2 Neu negative left invasive ductal carcinoma


Reason for visit: Monitoring of adjuvant endocrine therapy for breast cancer


Initial Oncologic History:  
Ms. Ito first palpated a left breast lump in 2070. Two years later she was seen by her PCP and referred to surgery. In March '72 a mammogram showed a 1.6 cm left breast mass at 12 o'clock, also evident on ultrasonography. An additional group of indeterminate microcalcifications was noted in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. 
On 3/22/72 a biopsy of the left breast mass confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma. Stereotactic core biopsy of the upper outer quadrant calcifications showed only fibrocystic changes. On 5/31/72 she underwent a L lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy.  Pathology revealed a 2.0 x 2.5 x 2.3cm invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 3,  with negative margins, ER+PR+Her2neu-, sentinel node negative. She was then referred to multidisciplinary clinic and received a recommendation for whole breast irradiation and adjuvant endocrine therapy.


INTERVAL HISTORY:  
Returns to see us for regular 6 month follow up. She had follow up chest imaging with her PCP which did not show evidence of pna. She is happy to hear this. She reports she is doing well at home. Son agrees. He is in the process of remodeling her home so it is handicap accessible. She can dress herself and wash herself. No new breast symptoms, pain or other concerns today.
Mammogram due this month, this is booked. She takes the arimidex daily and has noted no untoward effects.

Patient Name: LAGNSTON, SHERMAN I.;  MRN: 7223692
Dictated at: 12/09/67 by GARY J. HUGHES, MD 

 
FOLLOW UP NOTE 
 
DIAGNOSIS:  Renal cell carcinoma, presumably metastatic to T1.  Interval since conformal radiation therapy to vertebra T1 to a dose of 50.4 gray:  Three months.  
 
TUMOR STATUS:  Not available.  
 
NORMAL TISSUE STATUS:  No difficulty.  
 
INTERVAL HISTORY:  Mr. Lagnston is generally doing well with no deterioration and some improvement in his symptomatology.  He now has occasionally tingling in his feet and hands, which is possibly similar to before or less so.  He also has some posterior neck tingling, probably related to some position or activity and with lifting weight.  He has no weakness in any extremities.  His nocturia has decreased from three to one.  His hands feel a little ""fuzzy.""  The trembles, which he has had for some time are possibly better or the same, still a little worse on the left hand than the right.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination he looks well.  His weight is up to 230 pounds.  He has no percussible bony tenderness throughout.  His abdomen is entirely negative, so is his incision.  
 
IMPRESSION:  Clinically possibly slightly improved, certainly no evidence of progression.  
 
PLAN:  I will obtain a repeat chest and thoracic spine CT, as well as a bone scan.  Assuming that these are not indicative of further progression, I plan to see him in routine follow up in four to six months.  Dr. Levine would like some blood tests drawn on him, which I will happy to arrange when I hear exactly what they are.  Dr. Sweet is still seeing him frequently and giving him Norvasc and Atenolol for his blood pressure.

Location: Ol 11

Referring Attending: Null



Reason for consult:  BRBPR



HPI: The patient is a 62 year old male with history of CAD s/p stents of LAD lesion in February 2070 readmit with chest pain.  At the time of this stenting, he had total occlusion of his midRCA and mid circumflex with collaterals.  He presented with recurrent CP in May, and he underwent a second cath that revealed patent LAD with stent.  This admission he had a 10-15 minute episode of chest and jaw pain with tachycardia and hypertension by home monitoring.  The pain resolved with two sublingual nitroglycerins.  He went to Butte Ridge Associates where he was placed on heparin.  In the setting of heparin bolus with PPT >150, he had one episode, moderate volume of painless rectal bleeding.  Since transfer, still on heparin, he had no further bleeding, nor guiac positive stool until today.   This morning he passed a large brown bowel movement which was guiac negative.  Following this, after returning to bed, he had a small amount of oozing of blood from his rectum.  He had no abdominal pain.  No further bleeding since this morning.  He has never had rectal bleeding previously on aspirin and plavix.  His colonoscopy in 2066 revealed diverticulosis.  He is currently on aspirin, plavix, heparin with therapeutic PTT.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 

62 year old male with CAD with chest pain to be evaluated by cardiac cath with painless BRBPR following a large bowel movement today in the setting of heparin, aspirin and plavix.  This bleeding was minimal and self-limited, most likely of hemorrhoidal origin, rather than diverticular.  He does have some risk of recurrent rectal bleeding on these blood thinners, but the bleeding is likely to continue to be limited.  There is no contraindication to cardiac catherization or continuing these important medications.  There is also no intervention we could do now to adjust the risk.  Would recommend proceeding to cardiac catherization.  No alteration in medications required.

Personal data and overall health

			

  This is a 63-year-old man status post renal cell CA and coronary artery disease.



Reason for visit

			

  Followup multiple medical problems.



Major Problems





Coronary artery disease

The patient had recatheterization in May demonstrating 30% stenosis at the stent on the LAD.  He has diffuse disease, otherwise with good collateralization.  His exercise tolerance test in May showed excellent exercise tolerance, but positive images and positive tracings for ischemia.  His Duke ETT score was -10, but his perfusion images showed moderate reversibility in the inferior myocardium with fixed defect anteriorly.  He had infero-apical hypokinesis with an EF of 45%.  It is also noted that his blood pressure fell, but normalized during exercise.  The patient has been stable until last several weeks when he has noted some lower jaw symptoms anteriorly.  He has no chest squeezing, neck squeezing, or jaw pain, but there is an odd sensation under the front teeth.  He correlates this with exercise, but not consistently.  He also occasionally feels this at rest.  He is able to walk uphill and generate a pulse of 90.  He is working doing heavy labor in the garden, moving, and digging.  It is not clear that this represents angina, but we will let Dr. Null know.  He is seeing Dr. Null in three to four weeks.     01/13/2072: .  The patient has been improving steadily since his last admission for CABG in November 2070.  He states his exercise tolerance is steadily improving and he is able to walk 2 miles at a rate of 17 minutes per mile without dyspnea or fatigue.  He has no chest pain or palpitations.  He does worry about bradycardia and states his metoprolol of 50 mg BID may be too much.  He has been withholding half to full dose in the evenings when he finds his pulses about 50.  He has no symptoms of forgetfulness, dizziness, or loss of consciousness.  He does have cold extremities.  There is no weight gain, weight loss, or orthopnea.  He remains on beta blocker, lipitor, Diovan, hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, and warfarin.  He is no longer on Plavix.  He has no nitrate.  On exam, he is somewhat hypertensive, but lungs are good and there is no elevated JVP.  His EKG shows first-degree AV block and I have asked him to bring that to Dr.  Null's office today.  

A: Stable. 

P: Continue medicines as they are because of borderline blood pressure today.  We would not escalate



Elevated blood pressure

The patient is on Diovan, hydrochlorothiazide, and metoprolol.  He states his blood pressure at home is usually quite good and he feels it is responsive to external stressors.  I have asked him to think hard about removing those stressors from his life in order to maintain health.



Hyperlipidemia

The patient remains on 40 mg of lipitor.  It has been a year since we have checked his excellent results and we will check today.  He has been fasting for 12 hours.



Iron deficiency anemia

We will recheck his indices today.  He is not fatigued or pale.



Renal carcinoma

The patient had repeat MRI and CT in January at the Healthwin Hospital.  These were read as stable and he needs no intervention other than continued monitoring at six-month intervals.  He is quite reassured by this.



Seborrheic keratosis

The patient is ready for evaluation by Dermatology.  He has several atypical-looking keratoses as well as poorly rounded lesions consistent with BCCs.  I have referred him to Dermatology today.



Sinus congestion

RE:  Peggy Tinsley
     MR #236-67-03-3
 
Dear Dr. Ventura:
 
Peggy Tinsley was seen in the renal clinic today.  This patient
with end stage renal disease secondary to diabetes was initiated
on hemodialysis 2 weeks ago in MH.  She has been doing well
except for the complaint of fevers and rigors intermittently for
the past week.  There is no history of cough, dyspnea, or chest
pain.  She denies any dysuria, urgency, or frequency.  Her blood
sugars at home have been between 120 and 180.  
 
Her current medications include Tums 5 to 6 tabs with meals,
Erythropoietin, Premarin and Provera, Nephrox 150 mg tid, insulin
NPH 10 units qam.
 
On July 17, after hemodialysis, Ms. Tinsley was given a partial
dose of Vancomycin and developed pruritus.  CBC at the time
revealed a white count of 6.2 with a hematocrit of 25.2.  Blood
cultures were sent.
 
On examination today this lady appeared well with a BP of 110/60
and a pulse of 88.  She was afebrile.  Head and neck examination
was unremarkable and chest was clear to IPPA.  On cardiovascular
examination JVP was at the sternal angle and there was no
peripheral edema.  Heart sounds were normal.
 
Urinalysis did not reveal and white cells and contained 3+
protein and 2+ glucose.
 
Miss Tinsley should be followed up at her dialysis center. 
There does not appear to be any evidence of a graft infection. 
She should also have a urine sent for culture to rule out urinary
tract infection.  Because of her early satiety she has been
eating poorly and we might suggest that she be started on a
gastroprokinetic agent such as Cisapride 10 mg qid.

Re:  Peggy Tinsley
     MR#  236-67-03-3
 
Dear Dr. Ventura:
 
Peggy Tinsley was seen in the Renal Clinic today.  Her chief
symptomatic complaint is severe pruritus, which has not improved
much with Benadryl.  She has yet to fill the prescription for Sarna
lotion.  Her diarrhea has improved with Imodium, and she brought in
samples for cultures today.  Her appetite has improved somewhat.
She notes exertional fatigue and shortness of breath.  Medications
include Phoslo 1 tablet t.i.d., Lasix 160 mg b.i.d., Altase  2.5 mg
b.i.d., Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d., NPH 10 units q.d., iron t.i.d.
 
On examination, weight was 46.8 kilos, which is stable.  Heart rate
was 72, blood pressure 130/64.  JVP was clearly seen at 6 cm
greater than the sternal angle, and there was 1 plus peripheral
edema.  There was no S3.  Chest examination revealed bibasilar
inspiratory crackles.  Her left hand is no longer cold, but the
PTFE graft remains slightly edematous.
 
Blood work from May 30th showed a hematocrit of 23, potassium 5.2,
bicarbonate 15, BUN 91, creatinine 7.9, calcium 5.5., phosphate
5.2, albumin 3.4.
 
We will continue to hold off on dialysis until such time as Peggy's
PTFE graft is suitable.  This will save her the additional
morbidity of a semipermanent IJ catheter.  She is more hypervolemic
than last week, and I added Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg in the morning to her
diuretic regimen.  By oversight, she was not started on Rocaltrol,
and I have started her on Rocaltrol .25 mcg p.o. q.d., and
Nephrocaps 1 p.o. q.d.

                                             FPM#:  236-67-03-3
 
 
Dear Dr. Stafford:
 
     I was asked to provide a cardiologic evaluation on Mrs.
Tinsley with a concentration on her appropriateness to be listed
as a recipient for a cadaver renal transplant.  In summary, she is
a 46 year old woman who has been an insulin dependent diabetic
since the age of 29 and has been on hemodialysis since 2083.  By
report, her other complications for diabetes include retinopathy,
peripheral neuropathy, and peripheral vascular disease.  In viewing
her present history, she works in the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt learning technology department.  Her
three times a week hemodialyses are uncomplicated.  She does,
however,  experience occasional chest pressure with activities and
on rare occasions has had nocturnal angina.  These episodes are
relieved by nitroglycerin.  Mrs. Tinsley has also noted that with
walking she will occasionally get short of breath which is relieved
by slowing down.  
 
     In addition to diabetes and hypertension which was present
only pre-dialysis, she has been and continues to be a smoker.  Her
cholesterol by one report was 228 mg/dl.  I don't have
fractionations and her family history is unknown.  
 
     A report of an echocardiogram from April of 2083, shows mild
ventricular hypertrophy in the presence of mitral insufficiency,
preserved LV size and function.  She had an exercise tolerance test
in February of 2085.  On a modified protocol, she went for less
than 4 1/2 minutes.  This is equivalent to not even completing
stage 1 of the standard Bruce.  With that, she did develop chest
pain and had 2 mm of ST depression. That study was accompanied by
both fixed and reversible isotopic perfusion changes in the septum
consistent with prior non-transmural infarct with exercise induced
ischemia.  As was apparent to those involved, even the non-isotope
portion alone was worrisome for high grade coronary disease and led
to the recommendation for a cardiac catheterization.  
 
     That study was done in Macdonald Hospital and at this time, I
only have the report.  However, from this report, there was
preserved LV function with anterior lateral hypokinesis and trace
MR that is consistent with the echo and the thallium studies. 
Coronary angiography showed by report, diffuse involvement of
proximal mid-LAD without specific focal stenosis until an 80% mid-
LAD.  The circumflex was also diffusely diseased and there was a
discrete stenosis in the mid section of a large marginal.  The
right coronary artery was diffusely diseased with a discrete
stenosis.  At that time, the recommendation was to continue medical
therapy.  
 
     Her medical therapy at this time is estrogen replacement with
prempro 2.5 mg once a day, tenormin 25 mg qd, aspirin one every
other day in addition to her supplemental vitamins, iron and twice
daily insulin therapy.  
 
     In rounding out her medical history, her surgical procedures
have involved the hemodialysis access.  She has had one pregnancy
28 years ago without complications.  I also elicited a history of
some focal arm weakness and occasional slurring of speech.  This
was difficult to pin down, but is of some concern.
 
     On exam, her blood pressure was 150/80  mm Hg, pulse 90
regular, her weight 95 lbs.  Her hemodialysis shunt is on the left
arm.  There was a right carotid bruit, neck veins were not
distended.  Lungs were clear, PMI was displaced and sustained. 
There was an S4, no S3 and there was a holo systolic murmur at the
apex.  Abdomen was benign, femoral pulses were intact, extremities
were without edema.  The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm,
diffuse STT changes.  There were no pathologic Q waves.
 
     Although the focus of this evaluation was originally for
transplant candidacy, I am concerned about her current cardiac
status.  She is a young diabetic woman, symptomatic of both
shortness of breath and chest pain and on exercise test, has
limited functional capacity.  The coronary angiography reveals a
presence of multi-vessel disease.  Even without seeing the primary
data which I hope to do in the next week, it would be unlikely that
she would be an angioplasty candidate, given the poor results in diabetics.  
Therefore, coronary revascularization for her would be coronary artery 
bypass surgery. 
 
 
     Obviously, I would like to review the films first, and speak
with Dr. Upson regarding augmentation of her anti-anginals.  I
would also like to add pravastatin at this time, starting with only
10 mg and obtain non-invasive studies of the carotids.  As
indicated, although the focus of this evaluation was her
suitability for transplantation, the issue of controlling
symptomatic coronary artery disease in this young woman became more
pressing.
 
     I look forward to working with you and the other physicians in
her care.
 
 
                                   Sincerely,

Lydia Levine
MR #813-25-60-5
March 20, 2076
 
Ms. Levine is a 50-year-old, perimenopausal woman with non-
insulin dependent diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and a history
of tobacco use, who underwent a recent cardiac catheterization
for a positive stress test.  At catheterization she had a
proximal 60% lesion in her RCA as well as a mid 60-70% RCA
lesion, obtuse marginal lesion of 60%, and an LAD mid lesion of
60%.  At the time it was decided to continue medical therapy on
Ms. Levine.  Since her cardiac catheterization approximately two
weeks ago, she has had no recurrent symptoms of chest pain.  She
continues on her medicines including Lopid 500 mg b.i.d.,
atenolol, aspirin, and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed, as
well as her oral hypoglycemic medicines.
 
Physical Examination:  She is an obese, white female in no acute
distress.  Her vital signs are stable.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation.  Cardiac exam reveals regular rate and rhythm,
normal S1 and S2; no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  She has no
peripheral edema.
 
Electrocardiogram shows a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 70,
axis of about 46, and there are no acute ST-T changes noted.
 
Impression/Plan:  We will continue Ms. Levine on her current
cardiac regimen.  She has three-vessel coronary artery disease,
non-obstructive in nature.  As long as she remains asymptomatic
on her current medical regimen, we will continue to follow her. 
She will return for a follow-up visit in approximately three
months.

This patient was seen in combination with Dr. Lance Camacho.  His note reflects our joint assessment and plan.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, Ms. Levin is a 54-year-old female with diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, who has known coronary artery disease.  She had an exercise test in 2076 for some vague symptoms, which was positive, and led to cardiac catheterization.  This catheterization revealed 60% LAD lesion, 50% first marginal, 60% RCA, and a 70% diagonal lesion.  She was maintained on medical management with few symptoms.  She has been lost to followup from Cardiology Clinic.  She has within the last week developed increasing symptoms with minimal exertion.  She underwent a stress test in which she was able to exercise for 6 minutes and 9 seconds on the Bruce protocol.  She achieved 93% of age-predicted maximal heart rate.  At 4 minutes, she developed 2 mm ST segment depressions in the anterior leads associated with chest discomfort.  She is a vague historian, but has not had clear rest anginal symptoms.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, she is mildly obese white female.  She has no jugular venous distention.  Her carotids are 2+.  Her heart shows normal S1 and S2.  There is a 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex.  Lungs are clear.  Abdomen is benign.  Extremities show no cyanosis or edema.  Electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm, normal axis and intervals.  There is no evidence of ischemia or infarction.

ASSESSMENT:  Ms. Levin is a 55-year-old diabetic woman with progressive anginal symptoms with known moderate 3-vessel coronary artery disease from 4 years ago with at least moderate risk, positive stress test.  After discussion with Dr. Camacho, our plan will be continue her on aspirin, beta-blocker, and a low-dose ACE inhibitor through her regimen.  She refuses to take a cholesterol-lowering agent due to previous concerns with myalgias.  She will be referred for cardiac catheterization within the next several days with a goal to better define her coronary anatomy for the possibility of percutaneous coronary intervention versus cardiac bypass surgery.

RE:  Roberta Vincent
     MR #380-18-32-2
 
Dear Dr. Long:
 
Thank you for referring Ms. Roberta Vincent to the Renal Services Clinic.  I had the pleasure of seeing her on November 16,
2092.  Please allow me to summarize her history for our records.
 
Ms. Vincent is a 56-year-old mother of eight with chronic renal
failure of unknown etiology.  She is six years status post
hysterectomy for endometriosis during which an occult
leiomyosarcoma was discovered.  She has an extensive history of
hidradenitis, obesity, and hypertension.  She had one stillborn
infant, one premature infant, and three spontaneous abortions. 
SFOC records are unavailable at this time.
 
Her medications include Premarin 0.625 qd, Diltiazem 240 qd,
furosemide 40 mg qd, Mevacor 20 mg qd, Calcitriol 0.25 mcg qd,
Niferex 300 mg qd, Vitamin E 400 units qd, fish oil qd, and Keflex
250 mg qid.
 
On physical examination Ms. Vincent is a 56-year-old woman in no
distress.  Her weight is 101.5 kilograms, or 223 lbs.  Temperature
is normal.  Pulse is 88 beats per minute.  Blood pressure is
178/96.  There is striking hirsutism and moon facies.  There is a
buffalo hump.  The lungs show scattered wheezing.  Cardiovascular
exam is normal.  There are discolorations of the skin across the
neck, upper extremities, and trunk which are hyperpigmented but not
raised.  The abdomen is obese without palpable masses.  There is a
ventral hernia deep in the lower part of the abdomen.  The
extremities show trace edema.  There are several areas of
superficial petechiae.
 
In summary, this 56-year-old woman has chronic renal failure of
unclear etiology.  She does report an episode of lower extremity
swelling in association with an episode of hidradenitis.  ThisRoberta Vincent
MR #380-18-32-2               -2-            November 16, 2092
 
 
raises the possibility of a post-infectious glomerulonephritis now
in a chronic phase.  Other diagnostic possibilities include other
forms of chronic glomerulonephritis including systemic lupus
erythematosus given the history of spontaneous abortions. 
Nevertheless, I agree that kidney biopsy is not indicated at this
time given the advanced nature of her disease and the increased
risk due to her body habitus.
 
I discussed several options in renal replacement therapy with Ms.
Vincent. Although she has no medical conditions which would
preclude living-related or cadaveric kidney transplantation, her
obesity and glucose intolerance along with the history of
hidradenitis make transplantation a less attractive option.  I have
encouraged Ms. Vincent to attempt a gradual weight loss program in
order to improve her fitness prior to either dialysis or
transplantation.  Nevertheless, her appearance is quite reminiscent
of Cushing's disease, and this should be worked up if it has not
been performed previously.
 
I have arranged an iothalamate GFR to more closely approximate her
kidney function and a follow-up appointment in two months' time to
meet with Helen Uren and consider creation of a native AV
fistula or placement of a graft.
 
Thank you once again for your kind referral.
 
Respectfully,

RE:  Roberta Vincent
     MR #380-18-32-2
 
Dear Dr. Xanthos,
 
We had the privilege of seeing your patient, Mrs. Roberta Vincent, in
the Renal Services Clinic on January 18, 2093.  We will
not repeat her history as you know it well. Over the past three
months Mrs. Vincent has complained of increasing fatigue,
occasionally sleeping more than 12 hours per night, forgetfulness
and tingling of the fingers and toes. She has maintained a
relatively good appetite and denies nausea, vomiting or shortness
of breath.  An Iothalamate GFR test obtained on December 14, 2092
revealed a glomerular infiltration rate of approximately 10 ml per
minute, suggesting profound loss of renal function.
 
On physical examination today her weight is 99.5 kilograms or 219
pounds.  Blood pressure is 150/90, pulse is 80 and regular.  The
lungs are clear. There is no peripheral edema. Again, there marked
cushingoid features. Despite overall weight loss, Mrs. Vincent
comments that she has gained facial and abdominal fat as well as
facial hair over the past several months.
 
In summary, Mrs. Vincent appears to be developing early symptoms of
uremia.  Given her advanced azotemia we believe that she should
undergo creation of an arteriovenous fistula so that she may start
dialysis within the next several months. We have arranged to
recheck her chemistries today.  We would also recommend that she
undergo repeat work up for her cushingoid features.  Although renal
failure may alter hormonal balance and may promote occasional
androgenic features in woman, this is beyond ordinary.
 
Thank you once again for allowing us to participate in her care.

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 59 year old female who 
presents to us with shortness of breath tonight.  She has been 
developing shortness of breath now with nausea and vomiting today. 
There is no history of fevers, no chills, and no abdominal pain. 
She does complain of some mild flank pain but nothing significant. 
She has had chronic back pain for years. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a significant past medical 
history.  History is significant for hypertension, diabetes, and 
congestive heart failure.  She is status post total abdominal 
hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and status post 
L5-S1 laminectomy. 
MEDICATIONS:  The patient is on multiple medications including 
Lasix, lisinopril, prednisone, Premarin, nifedipine. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Here the patient looked mildly 
uncomfortable.  Blood pressure was 151/58, oxygen saturation was 99 
percent, and heart rate was 98.  Blood pressure has remained stable 
since she has been here.  Heent examination was normal.  Pupils 
were reactive normally bilaterally.  Oropharynx was clear.  Neck 
was mildly obese with no jugular venous distention.  There were 
good carotid upstrokes, no bruit.  Lungs had some crackles 
two-thirds of the way up and some rales at the bases, one-half way 
up.  Cardiac examination revealed S1 and S2, somewhat tachycardic, 
with a 2/6 murmur.  Abdomen had multiple striae and was soft and 
non-tender, with good bowel sounds.  There were good pulses 
throughout.  Extremities were normal. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Electrolytes here were normal.  Blood sugar 
was normal.  White count was 14, hematocrit 34.  Initial CK was 
140, troponin 2.6.  Chest x-ray showed moderate effusion and a 
small left effusion.  Patient's last echocardiogram showed an 
ejection fraction of 60 percent.  This echocardiogram was done in 
February of 2096.  She also had a second echocardiogram in April of 
2096 which showed an ejection fraction of 55 percent, with moderate 
MR.  EKG here showed ST depression in V6 and some decreased T's in 
aVR and aVL.  Sinus rhythm on EKG rated about 100. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  In the Emergency Department the 
patient was heparinized.  She was placed on oxygen, given an 
aspirin, and placed on a Nitroglycerin drip.  She also received 
some Nitropaste here.  She also received a mg of Morphine.  SFOC 
Cardiology was aware of the patient's troponin of 2.6, indicating 
that she had a myocardial infarction or could still be evolving a 
myocardial infarction here.  She received IV Lasix 60 mg here and 
responded very well.  She was diuresing considerably and her 
shortness of breath appeared to be much better than when she 
arrived here in the Emergency Department. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Congestive heart failure with myocardial 
infarction, diuresing well and responding to medications. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 
admitted to the CCU.  SFOC is aware.  She remains in stable 
condition here and is going to be transferred up to CCU in a little 
while.  Condition at this time is satisfactory.

See primarily by Dr. Ulises Collier.  I also saw the patient and 
reviewed Dr. Collier's history. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 62 year-old woman comes from 
dial where she developed substernal chest pain radiating to her 
left arm near the end of the run.  She also complains of shortness 
of breath.  She noted some nausea, but no vomiting.  She had no 
other related symptoms.  She has had no previous history of chest 
pain.  She was given Nitroglycerin x 3 and this eventually relieved 
her pain. 
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes end-stage renal disease, 
coronary artery disease with a bypass graft but without any chest 
pain at the time, and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus which may 
account for her previous cardiac history without chest pain. 
ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN AND CODEINE 
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin and Xanax. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 164/94, pulse 
94, respirations 24, oxygen saturation 96%.  GENERAL:  The patient 
is comfortable in no acute distress.  HEAD AND NECK: 
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils equal and reactive. Pharynx 
benign.  Tongue is of normal shape and contour.  Neck is supple. 
No jugular venous distention.  LUNGS:  Are clear bilaterally. 
CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm.  S1, S2, with no murmurs, rubs 
or gallops.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and non-tender with normal bowel 
sounds.  EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema or rash. 
NEUROLOGICAL:  Patient is alert and oriented x 3.  She moves all 
extremities.  Has symmetrical strength and all proximal and distal 
upper and lower motor bilaterally.  Normal sensation to light touch 
grossly. 
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 9, hematocrit 41.  Glucose was 
high at 533.  However, she has bicarbonate of 24, so she is 
probably not in diabetic ketoacidosis.  BUN 31, creatinine 3.8. 
Troponin-I was 0.5.  Chest x-ray was negative.  Electrocardiogram 
shows normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and 
non-specific ST/T wave changes.  Perhaps some ST depressions in II, 
III and AVF, and deep S waves in V1, 2, 3, and 4. 
TREATMENT RENDERED AND COURSE IN ED: In the hospital the patient 
did not have further chest pain here.  She was admitted for chest 
pain and for rule out myocardial infarction to the Medical Service. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Rule out myocardial infarction 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Admitted.

hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. q.d. for the last year, which he discontinued 
last Sunday, who now comes in because over the last two to three weeks 
he has been having trouble with increased dizziness and headaches, and 
he is afraid that his sugar is up.  He states that over the last two or 
three weeks, he gets stars and floaters and sometimes halos of light 
followed by mild headaches.  He says that the visual changes are usually 
accompanied by the headache, and the headache is usually relieved with 
Excedrin in 5 minutes to an hour.  He does admit to a history of 
migraines but states that in the past his migraines have been much more 
severe than this, though the visual aura is very similar to his previous 
migraine aura.  
 
He states that he was seen in the emergency room on 1-12, at which time 
they did a finger stick which was about 180, and they told him to come 
to this appointment at this time.  He denies any fevers.  He does have a 
recent 25 lb weight gain and he admits to new nocturia of 2-3 times a 
night over the last three weeks.  He also has been complaining of 
diarrhea two or three times a week over the last two to three weeks, 
which is watery in nature without any blood.  He has no nausea or 
vomiting or any fever, and he has never had problems with diarrhea like 
this in the past.  His past medical history is otherwise benign.  
 
Habits:  He does have a history of cocaine abuse, and while he was free 
basing about one year ago, he came into the emergency room with chest 
pain and was told that this was secondary to lack of oxygen to his heart 
from the cocaine, since which time he has been using cocaine much less 
frequently.  He denies any tobacco use, and he drinks alcohol socially.  
He is currently unemployed and lives with his mother.  He is sexually 
active with one sexual partner and denies any other risk factors.
 
Family History:  His family history is notable for a grandmother with 
diabetes and hypertension, mother with heart disease and father with 
history of breast CA, who is currently getting radiation therapy here.  
His oldest brother died of street violence and his younger brother is 
alive and well without any medical problems. 
 
Physical Examination;  He is a mildly obese black male in no acute 
distress with weight of 270 lbs.  Blood pressure 138/88 in the right arm 
and 132/94 in the left arm.  Pulse regular at about 80.  HEENT was 
notable for normal fundi without any evidence of diabetic retinopathy or 
hypertensive retinopathy.  Oropharynx was clear.  He had no thyromegaly.  
His chest was clear.  His breasts showed no masses or discharge, and his 
                                              1-29-62
 
 
 
heart sounds were normal.  His abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, 
without any hepatosplenomegaly.  Genitalia: normal, with bilaterally 
descended testes, and his rectal exam was normal tone with brown trace 
heme positive stool.  Neurologic exam was intact. 
 
Assessment and Plan:  
 
1.   Non-insulin dependent diabetes with possible symptoms of increased 
     sugar at this time.  Will check a fasting blood sugar tomorrow 
     morning as well as a hemoglobin A1C, and may increase his Diabeta 
     to 10 mg. q.d.  He will be referred to a nutritionist for diet 
     control as well.  
2.   Hypertension: borderline hypertension at this time off meds.  I 
     will recheck his blood pressure in a week to two weeks, and if it 
     is still borderline at that time, will follow only with a low-salt 
     diet.  
3.   Trace heme positive stool: may be from his diarrhea.  I will get a 
     stool culture and O&P since the diarrhea is persistent for two to 
     three weeks, and follow it at this time.
4.   Patient requesting HIV test: and HIV counseling was given at this 
     point, and a test will be drawn, and I will give him the result 
     when it is back, though I feel that he is very low risk at this 
     time.

HPI:  The patient is a 41 year old man with a history of non-insulin 
dependent diabetes, hypertension, obesity and substance abuse who I 
learned today was recently admitted for deep venous thrombosis and is 
presenting for follow up of his DVT.  The patient's current medical 
problems include:
1.   Recent DVT.  The patient was admitted between the days of 1-24 and 
     1-30 secondary to the development of a right lower extremity DVT.  
     The patient told me that he had been doing well and denied any 
     previous trauma to his leg or other predisposing factors such as long 
     car or airplane trips and he stated he had been as active as 
     previously over the recent few weeks.  The patient stated he awoke 
     in the morning of the 24th and noted tightness in his right 
     quadriceps and right calf.  He later developed progressive swelling 
     of the leg and therefore presented to the THD emergency 
     department.  He had lower extremity non-invasives performed which 
     confirmed the presence of a right lower extremity DVT.  He was 
     admitted and heparinized and then Coumadinized prior to discharge.  
     The patient disclosed a history that his daughter had a DVT at the 
     time of her pregnancy and therefore a hypercoagulability work-up was 
     sent off which was negative.  The patient currently returns to me 
     complaining of further right calf pain and swelling.  He states that 
     he was interested in physical therapy but states that that did not 
     occur during his hospital course.  The patient was also angry and 
     upset that I had not visited him during his hospital stay.  I 
     explained to him that I had not been notified of his admission or of 
     his emergency department visit.  I called all of the parties 
     responsible for his admission to clear the confusion that had 
     occurred.
 
2.   Hypertension.  The patient's previously been on anti-hypertensives 
     including lisinopril, unfortunately the patient has not tolerated ACE 
     inhibitors secondary to a severe cough and therefore these were 
     discontinued recently.  With a discontinuation of his drinking, the 
     patient's blood pressures have been under much better control.
 
3.   Adult onset diabetes mellitus.  I recently started the patient on 
     insulin.  He was scheduled for a follow up visit but unfortunately 
     did not make his visit.  His insulin dose was adjusted during his 
     recent hospitalization and his current dosage is 35 units of NPH in 
     the morning and 15 units of regular.  In the evening he takes 10 
     units of NPH and 10 units of regular.  The patient does not yet have 
     a home glucometer.  We will arrange for this.

                                              2-4-65
 
 
 
Physical Examination:  Vital signs showed a heart rate of 90.  Blood 
pressure: 135/92. Respiratory rate: 14 and unlabored.  HEENT: pupils 
equal, round and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, 
oropharynx clear. Mucous membranes moist. Cardiac: regular rate and 
rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Lungs: clear to 
ausculation. Abdomen soft, nontender with active bowel sounds.  
Extremities:  There was notable edema of his right lower extremity with 
significant pain and a positive Homan's sign.  
 
Impression:
1)   DVT.  Given his current physical examination, and lack of recent PT 
     check since time of discharge on the 30th, I am sending a stat PT.  I 
     encouraged the patient to elevate the leg. My feeling is that the DVT 
     has not successfully been treated and that likely his PT is not 
     therapeutic at the present time.  I have arranged for the patient to 
     follow up with Aguilar, the Internal Medicine nurse, on Wednesday for a repeat 
     check of his PT.  I left instructions that I should be called 
     immediately upon receiving the PT value, I also arranged for the 
     patient to meet with the physical therapist for the provision of a 
     cane to help with ambulation. 
 
2)   Adult onset diabetes.  I will recheck a hemoglobin A1C value at his 
     next office visit.  A finger stick in the office approximately three 
     hours after eating is 253.  I feel this is still too elevated.  I 
     will therefore adjust his insulin dose when I see him next week.  I 
     will follow up with the patient next week and make any necessary 
     adjustments in his medications at that time.

HPI:  The patient is a 43 year old man with multiple medical problems 
who presents for routine follow up.
 
CURRENT ISSUES:
1.   Adult onset diabetes mellitus.  The patient had a hemoglobin A1C 
     approximately a month and a half ago, which was 9.5.  We discussed 
     this in the office today, with the general concept that someone who 
     is taking three injections of insulin a day should have much 
     tighter control.  He states he has been following his finger 
     sticks, though admits that occasionally forgets to do this. His 
     current regimen is 35 units of NPH in the morning with 20 units of 
     regular.  At bedtime, he is taking 35 units of NPH and 6 units of 
     regular at dinnertime.  He denies any symptoms of hypoglycemia.
2.   Hypercholesterolemia.  Of note, the patient recently experienced a 
     rash to his simvastatin.  This resolved on the discontinuation of 
     the simvastatin.  Of note, his most recent cholesterol was 314 in 
     January, 2067.  He has met with the dietician to discuss the 
     institution of a low-fat diet, and states that he tries to avoid 
     fats.
3.   Venous insufficiency secondary to deep venous thrombosis.  The 
     patient states he is doing better since the institution of a 
     Jobst stocking.  He still notes significant edema when he doesn't 
     wear this, but notes an improvement in ambulation when he is 
     compliant with the stocking.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure:  130/90.  Heart rate:  76.  
Respiratory rate:  12 and unlabored.  Cardiac exam:  Regular rate and 
rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs.  Lungs are clear to auscultation.  
Abdomen:  Soft, non-tender, obese, with active bowel sounds.  
Extremities show no clubbing or cyanosis.  There is 1+ pedal edema of 
the right lower extremity, which is covered with a Jobst stocking.  Foot 
care remains excellent.
 
IMPRESSION:                         
1.   Adult onset diabetes mellitus.  We will increase the patient's 
     morning NPH dose to 40 units.  He will once again try to become 
     more compliant with his diet.  He will be scheduled for a follow up 
     ophthalmologic examination.
2.   Hypercholesterolemia.  We will hold off re-starting therapy given 
     his recent rash to simvastin.  We will re-check a fasting lipid 
     profile as well as a set of LFT's.

3.   General health maintenance.  We will once again schedule a follow 
     up examination with the dietician as well as the ophthalmologist.  
     He will keep a log of his sugars and follow up with me in the 
     clinic in approximately one to two months.

For his pre-operative work-up, the patient had a stress PET exam on 3/26 that was notable for a medium-sized defect of moderate intensity in the mid and basal inferior and inferolateral walls that was reversible. As a result, the patient was referred to Dr. Carroll who saw the patient in clinic on 3/27. Given the patient's risk factors and positive stress test, the patient was scheduled for right and left heart catheterization on the day of admission with the plan to delay his hip surgery if he requires a stent and subsequent Plavix therapy. On the evening prior to his catheterization, he had dialysis.
 
The patient went to the cath lab where he was found to have an 80% lesion of the mid-RCA so a bare-metal stent was placed. After cath, the patient was started on ASA 325mg PO daily and Plavix loaded with 600mg PO x 1 then 75mg PO daily thereafter.

EDVISIT^46103196^HART, MATTHEW^06/14/79^NAPOLITANO, URSULA

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old male

with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis,

history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, and

DVT on Coumadin who comes in to the ER because he has recently

missed dialysis appointment and he feels increased abdominal

girth and shortness of breath.  He said that his father has been

sick, so he has been spending a significant amount of time

helping him and because of that had a short dialysis on Wednesday

and missed his Friday dialysis run.  Today is Sunday and he

generally gets dialysis on Sunday as well.  When I asked if he

has been having chest pain, he says he has not had chest pain,

but he did have a tickling in his chest that lasted seconds and

was not accompanying with any diaphoresis or radiation of the

pain.  Even he was ambulatory into the ED, he had no chest pain

when he was exerting himself.  He does feel slightly increased

shortness of breath and worse when he walks around, but he thinks

that because of increased fluids.  He has had no fevers or

chills, no lightheadedness, no nausea, vomiting and no diarrhea.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis,

coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis,

diabetes, DVT on Coumadin, hypertension, bladder cancer,

substance abuse and GERD.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  AV fistula in 01/2078.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, rare alcohol and occasional cocaine

use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Breast cancer and prostate cancer.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As mentioned in HPI, otherwise negative.

MEDICATIONS:  Reviewed, please see the list.

ALLERGIES:  Include cephalosporin and simvastatin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.3, heart rate 92,

respiratory rate 28, blood pressure 155/84 and O2 saturation 100%

on room air.  The patient is awake, alert, talking in complete

sentences, appears to be mildly uncomfortable.  ENT:  Atraumatic.

 Neck:  Normal to inspection, supple.  Chest:  Clear to

auscultation bilaterally, no rales.  Cardiovascular:  Regular

rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Minimal

distention, soft.  No focal tenderness.  Skin is intact. 

Extremities:  No lower extremity swelling or edema, no calf

tenderness bilaterally.  Neuropsychiatric:  Oriented x3.  Cranial

nerves II through XII tested and intact.  No motor or sensory

deficits.  Gait is normal.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient received an EKG, which

showed normal sinus rhythm.  No significant ST or T

abnormalities, no significant peaked T waves are consistent with

his previous EKG.  PA lateral chest x-ray showed no evidence of

acute cardiopulmonary infiltrates.  Only labs which resulted

initially were CBC, which showed a hematocrit of 33.2, platelets

423,000 and white count of 6.74.  We made contact with the renal

fellow who recommended that we proceed dialysis while the

dialysis unit still open and we felt that it was safe for this

patient.  His potassium was not back at the time that he left the

department, however, he was well appearing and had no arrhythmias

on the monitor and we think that his tickling chest sensation is

very atypical for cardiac symptom, not being, so we will reassess

when he comes back and likely check a second troponin to be sure

that this is unlikely to be acute coronary syndrome.  After he

left the department, additional labs came back include INR of 2.1

and a Chem-7 showing a sodium of 142, a potassium of 6.4, a

chloride of 102, bicarbonate of 21, BUN of 106, creatinine 6.18,

glucose of 195, CK of 157, troponin of less than 0.04, calcium

8.6, phosphorus of 5.1, and magnesium of 2.3 and promptly called

the renal fellow who was aware of the elevated potassium and have

the patient on the monitor in the Dialysis Unit and agreed to

treat him there acutely.  Again after the dialysis, the patient

will return to the Emergency Department.  We will reassess if

symptoms and see how he feels, check a second cardiac enzymes. 

If he feels significantly improved and he continues to have no

chest pain, we feel that his symptoms are likely atypical for

acute coronary syndrome and we also called that this was not

acute coronary syndrome if two troponins are not elevated and he

will be able to follow up and resume his regular dialysis

schedule.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Volume overload.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis.

DISPOSITION:  Pending.

Please see ED note for further ED course.  This was a shared

visit with resident physician, Dr. Adam Mcclure.

See NP note for full details. Briefly, this patient has history of back pain, L buttock and leg pain for which he has been scheduled for an outpt open MRI next week. The pain was worse in the last few days such that he has had difficulty walking due to pain. He does not have any weakness or numbness no loss of control of bowel or bladder. No fevers/chills. Has hx of prostate CA which certainly puts him at risk for spine mets.

PE

See NP note for full exam.

Neurologic exam: A & O x3, CN 2-12 intact, motor 5/5 all ext, sensation intact to light touch throughout, nl gait, normal finger-to-nose bilaterally, neg pronator drift. Pt reports that after having received pain medication he is now able to walk, whereas he wasn't earlier this evening when he first arrived because he was in too much pain.

Medical Decision Making ED Course

75M w/acute on chronic low back and left buttock pain, now improved after pain medication in the ED. The patient has no neurologic deficits at this time and is able to walk without assistance. Given the patient's history of prostate CA, he certainly needs further radiographic evaluation of his spine to evaluate for mets and should undergo MRI to assess for disc disease as well. Pt was offered MRI today, however he is certain he cannot tolerate a traditional closed MRI (he has tried before with medications). Given that the patient does not have any neurologic deficits, it is safe for him to be discharged home on an improved pain regimen with stool softeners as well and f/u with his already scheduled outpt open MRI next week. Pt and family understand to return if pt develops any neurologic symptoms.

Condition on Discharge

Stable

Diagnoses

Back pain

Review Comments

I have personally seen and examined the patient and confirmed the resident's examination, reviewed and agree with the resident's documentation of history, and discussed the evaluation, plan of care and disposition of the patient with the resident.

 January 25, 2151 (initial office note) Frank Caldwell:
	He is a 75 year old man who is referred by Dr. Freda Erickson of Mauston for consultation regarding a biopsy proven adenocarcinoma in the head of the pancreas. He apparently developed some twinge type pain in his right upper quadrant which he describes as    zingers    6 or 7 weeks ago. Work-up then involved imaging with a CT scan which I reviewed but do not have the written report on. This shows a mass in the head of the pancreas abutting and perhaps distorting the portal vein. He has not had any jaundice and does not have any change in his bowel functions. A subsequent endoscopic ultrasound examination confirms the mass in the head of the pancreas with features of portal vein invasion. Fine needle aspiration has confirmed adenocarcinoma. The mass itself is about 2   cm in diameter.
	His family history does not include any pancreatic cancer but his father had lung cancer.
	He denies smoking, drinking but exercises by walking about 5 days a week.
	His past surgical history includes a resection of an aortic aneurysm in 2131, cholecystectomy in 2131, prostatectomy for cancer in 2142 and resection of a lung cancer in 2143.
	His current medications include Lipitor 40mg a day, Glyburide 5mg three times a day (he has been taking it for 6     7 years), Lisinopril 5mg a day and a baby aspirin.
	He is said to be allergic to Sudafed and the dye used for CAT scans (the latter was apparently salivary gland swelling on the day following a CAT scan - - it is unclear whether the two are related).
	His review of systems also includes kidneys stones and spinal stenosis. He has had some mild recent weight loss. He denies symptoms of heart disease, neurologic disease or respiratory disease. His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
	I think he is not a candidate for attempted surgical resection at this time. With the findings consistent with portal vein invasion, he should first be treated with chemoradiation. He may be a candidate for subsequent surgery, probably not resection but perhaps intra-operative radiation therapy. I   ve explained this to him, his wife and daughter. After discussing the various alternatives we have agreed to have him evaluated in the Sawtooth Cancer Clinic for treatment planning for chemoradiation, with consideration of subsequent IORT. He comes from Elk Ridge and probably would prefer to have his treatment carried out at the Elk Ridge Health Center in coordination with us. This seems quite reasonable and we will proceed to set that up. I will also get a CA19-9 today and plan to see him at the completion of his chemoradiation.
	I spent 45 minutes in consultation and coordination of care.

	Reason for visit:

   chest pain, with known LCX lesion admit for cardiac cath in am.



	Interval History:

   75 yr old male who is admitted with new onset chest pain. Pt has a hx of significant   AAA  repair in '31and newly diagnosed nonoperable pancreatic cancer. During evaluation of pancreatic cancer, CT revealed pseudoaneurysm of aortic graft. Before start of chemotherapy, pt underwent surgical repair of pseudoaneurysm. 

2/16/51 Pt had successful surgical repair of the pseudoaneurysm, complicated by a intraoperative NSTEMI with a peak troponin of .36. 

2/20/51 echo done showing EF of 70%.

2/22/51 cath revealing LM normal, LAD 40% stenosis after D1, 95% stenosis at ostium of D1 and LCX 80% at the takeoff of OM2 with 70%ostial OM2 lesion, and RCA non-dominant with no significant disease.

Because pt was not having any symptoms of angina, the decision was made not to intervene on the LCX lesion and to stress the pt at a later date.

Currently pt is to begin treatment of his pancreatic cancer with chemotherapy and radiation.  Today pt was to have his first treatment, but starting having chest pain and was sent to the ER for further evaluation. 

Recently for the past three days, pt reports on and off chest pain lasting 4-5 hours with raidation to jaw and left arm at rest and excertion. No assciated symptoms of SOB or diaphoresis. Pt thought he was having heartburn symptoms.

In the ER, EKG showed mild lateral ST depression in V5-V6, initial troponin neg and chest pain relieved with one SL nitrogylcerin. Heparin started and pt transferred pain free to Cardiology.   Upon arrival, pt had one episode of chest pain, EKG showed no acute changes, chest pain relieved with one SL nitrogylcerin.

RE: URQUHART, WENDELL Y
MRN: 5747359
DOB: 11/22/2072


Dear Dr. Overman: 
I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Wendell Urquhart, in consultation today. The patient presents complaining of lower back pain with right lower extremity radiation. He develop symptoms gradually three months ago with no history of preceding trauma. The symptoms became progressively worse. The patient has a history of lower back injury 30 years ago in a motor vehicle accident - at that time he was diagnosed with disc rupture. Currently the pain is intermittent and occurs daily. He grades the intensity of the pain as up to 7 to 8 out of 10 on the numerical pain scale. He describes it as sharp shooting sensation in the lower back with radiation all the way down right lower extremity to the foot. The symptoms are worse with standing; better with sitting and lying down. There is no change in the intensity of symptoms with coughing or sneezing. The patient any recent fever or chills, no loss of bowel or bladder control. He describes occasional intermittent numbness in the right leg and foot. He denies any weakness. He lost 30 pounds through dieting over the past two months. The pain does not wake the patient up at night. 
Diagnostically, the patient denies any recent imaging studies of the lumbar spine. 


Therapeutically, the patient denies any recent physical therapy; no previous injections or surgical procedures of the lumbar spine. Currently he takes nabumetone 750 mg once in the morning with moderate relief of his symptoms. He also occasionally takes Naproxen at night with moderate relief. 
MEDICATIONS: 
1. Aspirin. 
2. Hydrochlorothiazide. 
3. Toprol. 
4. Caduet. 
5. Nabumetone as needed. 
6. Naproxen as needed. 
ALLERGIES: Penicillin. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
1. Coronary artery disease status post 2 stent placements. 
2. Hypertension. 
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 
1. Cardiac stent placement. 
2. Left total hip replacement. 
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient works as a programmer for Dish Network. He is married with no children. He does not smoke, drinks alcohol socially, and denies illicit drug use. 
FAMILY HISTORY: There is no history of medical problems that run in the family. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The complete review of systems was performed including constitutional, eyes, ENT, cardiovascular, respiratory, GI, GU, musculoskeletal, integument, neurological, psychiatric, endocrine, lymphatic, and immunologic. It is positive for musculoskeletal complains and medical problems as above.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is well-developed, moderately overweight man in no acute distress. He is alert and oriented to time, person and place. His mood and affect are stable. He demonstrates good attention and concentration. The patient ambulates without an assistive device with normal heel strike and toe off.  He is able to stand on his heels and toes. He is able to walk heel to toe in a straight line with intact balance. Vital signs are stable. Sclera is anicteric, no ptosis noted, no lymphadenopathy, unlabored respiration, abdomen is soft and non-tender, no skin rash.  


There is limited range of motion in the lumbar spine with flexion limited to 60 degrees, extension limited to 10 degrees. There is no tenderness to palpation over the spinous processes, paraspinal muscles, SI joints or greater trochanteric bursae bilaterally. There is full 5/5 strength in the lower extremities with intact sensation bilaterally.  1+ reflexes in the knees, absent reflexes in the ankles bilaterally. There is downgoing Babinski, no clonus, normal tone in the lower extremities. Straight leg raise test is negative bilaterally. There is no pain with hip internal and external rotation. 



Cervical range of motion is within normal limit. There is no tenderness to palpation over cervical spinous processes and paraspinal muscles. There is full 5/5 strength in the upper extremities with intact sensation bilaterally. Symmetrical reflexes in the biceps, brachioradialis and triceps bilaterally. Negative Hoffmans sign and Spurlings maneuver.  The range of motion in bilateral upper extremities is normal. 
IMAGING: During today's visit I reviewed x-ray study of the pelvis dated September 24 2132. it demonstrates lumbosacral spondylosis in the visualized lumbosacral spine. 
For complete description of the study, please see formal radiology report. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Sub-acute lower back pain with right lower extremity radiation, non-focal neurological examination. 
2. Lumbar radiculitis. 
3. Degenerative disc disease. 
4. Lumbar spondylosis. 
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. MRI study of the lumbar spine will be obtained to further evaluate etiology of ongoing symptoms. The patient will discuss with radiologist if MRI study can not be performed due to cardiac stents. 
2. Upon review of the imaging studies, a lumbar epidural steroid injection would be considered to decrease the inflammatory component of his symptoms and to inhibit peripheral nociceptive transmission. 
3. The patient was encouraged to remain active and to participate in low-impact aerobic exercises to prevent deconditioning. He was encouraged to continue with weight loss program. 
4. The therapeutic plan was discussed with the patient. All of his questions were answered. He will be seen in follow-up after imaging study is completed in 1-2 weeks. 



Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient. Please do not hesitate to call my office for any further questions. 


Sincerely,

Date of Visit: 06/25/2133








CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right buttock pain with right lower extremity radiation. 




HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  I had the pleasure of seeing Wendell Urquhart in follow-up today. He underwent right piriformis injection under fluoroscopic guidance on 06/10/2133. The patient reports greater than 50% improvement in his symptoms after the procedure. Currently the pain is intermittent. He describes it as sore sensation in the right buttock. He grades intensity of pain as 2/10 on the numerical pain scale. The symptoms are worse with prolonged walking for more than 2 miles a day and completely alleviated with rest. There is no change in the intensity of symptoms with Valsalva maneuver. The patient denies any recent fever or chills, no loss of bowel or bladder control, no numbness, no weakness, no unexplained weight loss. 





REVIEW OF MEDICAL HISTORY: During today's visit, I have reviewed past medical, social and family history, medication list and allergies. There has been no interval change as compared to the previous visit. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for musculoskeletal complains as described above. No recent fever, no chills, no chest pain, no shortness of breath, no abdominal pain, no loss of bowel or bladder control, no unexplained weight loss. The rest of the systems were reviewed and are negative.



PHYSICAL EXAM: The patient is alert and oriented to time, person and place. His mood and affect are stable. He demonstrates good attention and concentration. He ambulates without an assistive device with normal heel strike and toe-off. He is able to stand on heels and toes. He is able to walk heel-to-toe in a straight line with intact balance. There is limited range of motion in the lumbar spine with flexion limited to 80 degrees, extension limited to 20 degrees. There is no tenderness to palpation over piriformis muscles, paraspinal muscles, spinous processes, SI joints, or greater trochanteric bursa bilaterally. There is full 5/5 strength in the lower extremities with intact sensation bilaterally. 1+ reflexes in the knees, absent reflexes in the ankles bilaterally. There is downgoing Babinski, no clonus, normal tone in the lower extremities. Straight leg raise and femoral stretch test are negative bilaterally. There is pain with right hip internal rotation. 




IMPRESSION:

1.  Piriformis syndrome.

2.  Lumbar spondylosis with degenerative disk disease.

3.  Right hip arthropathy.




RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.  I had lengthy discussion with the patient about his condition and further treatment options. The patient will continue with home exercise program that he learned in physical therapy.

2.  The patient was encouraged to remain active and to participate in low-impact aerobic exercises as along as it does not exacerbate his symptoms.

3.  The patient was counseled on the benefits of weight reduction. He was informed about Weight Center here at Brooksville Regional Hospital. He is trying to control his weight through a balanced diet and aerobic exercises. He will consider an evaluation at the Weight Center if those approaches are not successful.

4.  The therapeutic plan was discussed with the patient. All of his questions were answered. In fact greater than 50% of today&#8217;s 25 minute visit was spent on counseling and coordination of care. I asked the patient to follow-up with me as needed if his symptoms return. 




It was my pleasure to follow-up with him.

I evaluated this patient independently.  I concur with findings

as noted on the medical record, supervised the care as provided

by the resident in the Emergency Department.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In brief, this is a 61-year-old male

with complaint of chest discomfort on exertion for the past six

weeks after climbing upstairs.  The patient noticed symptoms

again today.  He called his FLH physician who sent him to the

Emergency Department for probable admission.  The patient has had

a prior history of proximal RCA lesion and two stents placed in

06/2128 after similar episodes.  The patient has been doing well

since and recently has developed worsening symptoms.  He is

followed by Dr. Ure and contacted Dr. Ure's office who

sent him to the Emergency Department.  He denies chest pain at

rest.  He does not have abdominal pain.  No pain radiating to the

back.  No shortness of breath, dysuria, or additional symptoms.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension and coronary artery disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  As noted, past surgical history is stent

placement.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Past tobacco user.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for that which is noted on the

HPI.  All other symptoms are negative as noted in the medical

record.

MEDICATIONS:  Please refer to the chart.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs are as noted in the medical

record.  I examined this patient and agree with physical exam

findings as noted on the record.  Please refer to the chart.  Of

note, the patient has no specific physical exam findings, a

benign physical examination.

LABORATORY DATA:  Pending.  EKG is normal sinus rhythm with

biphasic T waves in III, V6 but otherwise normal, no acute ST-T

wave changes.  The patient is currently pain free.

ASSESSMENT AND MEDICAL DECISION MAKING:  This is a 61-year-old

male with likely stable angina that is worsening in character. 

He will be admitted to Cardiology.  I discussed this case with

the cardiologist on call, Dr. Maxwell.  The patient will be

admitted for further workup and determination of catheterization

if necessary.

Dear Dr. Nunes:
 
Thank you for asking me to see Mr. Craft. Patient says he was diagnosed 
as having neuropsychiatric lupus in 2103 at the Vermilion Hospital by Dr. Parker 
Xian and was treated with steroids at the time. It's not clear what CNS 
or neuropsychiatric manifestation he had at the time. Because of complex 
partial seizures he was seen by Dr. Arce at the Livingstone Homes who 
referred him to Dr. Hoffman at the Livingstone Homes who said that his 
estradiol level was in the 80s. His testosterone was up but available 
testosterone was down so he was put on Clomid and testolactone which he 
said turned off the lupus and turned off his seizures. Said he was doing 
fine until around 2 weeks ago when he felt that his lupus recurred. He 
said his neck felt full and warm. His head felt like it was going to 
explode. He had tinnitus, excess saliva, he felt that his lower jaw was 
vibrating and when he lay on his pillow his neck felt like it wasn't 
right. Also about the time he developed a cold with runny nose and 
postnasal drip. Lab work on February 8 showed a normal CBC, urine, and 
anti-DNA (in 2103 his ANA was positive at 1:1024 but I don't have any 
other results). He's had no fevers, no rashes other than a folliculitis 
on his legs. No new problem with head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, teeth 
or gum except that he has to wear his glasses. Recently had some teeth 
removed. Has a postnasal drip with a little bit of a cough. No other 
cardiorespiratory problems but takes Altace for mild hypertension. No GI 
problems. Has urinary frequency due to nocturia ever 2 hours, due to 
benign prostatic hypertrophy and recently had a TUR. Dr. Nunes

A PSA has been normal. Past history of kidney stones. He's allergic to 
penicillin, Lozol, allopurinol and bee venom. Has a past history of 
diagnosis of gout versus pseudogout. Sleeps fine. No history of fractures. 
Only operation is a total knee replacement on the left for arthritis and 
appendectomy. Bruises easily, frequently has headaches. Has been diagnosed 
as being bipolar. Exercises.
 
Recent MRI consistent with a ""vasculopathy.""
 
Family history. Mother died of colon cancer at 62, smoked. Father died 
at 62 of heart attack, stroke and insulin dependent diabetes, also 
smoked. He is an only child.
 
Social history. Doesn't smoke. When he's depressed he becomes a binge 
drinker. Exercises when he's not depressed. He's retired since 2103. Was 
a stage manager.
 
Physical exam. Somewhat overweight gentleman. Blood pressure was 160/80. 
Pulse was 88 and regular. Skin, a hint of livedo reticularis on 
forearms, and a couple of infected hair follicles around his knees. One 
small node in the left side of his neck. Mouth and throat was clear. 
Bilateral nasal polyp more on the right than left. Ear drums fine. 
Hearing fine (tuning fork in the middle of the forehead was heard in the 
forehead). Chest clear. No CVA tenderness. Heart: No murmurs. Abdomen, 
no organs, masses, tenderness but obese. Extremity, joint exam fine. 
Neurological fine.
 
I do not think that his lupus has acted up but think most of his current 
symptoms could be explained by an upper respiratory tract infection. 
However, I suspect he might have the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome 
and therefore have tested him for that, and also for complement level to 
also exclude lupus and vasculitis. Basically I told him to take Flonase 
twice a day until his ringing in the ear cleared up and postnasal drip 
cleared up. 
 
In the meantime continue on the Lamictal 100 mg twice a day as a 
stabilizer, Risperdal 0.25 mg per day as a mood stabilizer, the 
testolactone 50 mg 4 times a day to increase the availability of 
testosterone, the Clomid (clomiphene citrate) 50 mg per day to decrease 
estradiol, Levoxyl 50 mcg twice a day, Altace 10 mg twice a day regarding 
hypertension, and ibuprofen 800 mg twice a day for low back pain. Patient 
also gave me 2 pages of notes similar to what he had including comments 
regarding increased appetite, decreased memory,

decreased cognitive function, decreased balance, fatigue, decreased 
hearing, a history of carotid sinus, hypersensitivity, question of 
cholinergic transmission problems.
 
Also should be noted that a lot of his symptoms coincided with taking 
Aricept to improve his memory. Took it for 10 days and hasn't taken it 
for 2 weeks but his symptoms persisted. 
 
Thank you again for asking me to see him. Please let me know if I can be 
of further assistance. 
 
Sincerely yours,
 
 
 
Richard Aviles, M.D.
 
PS: If you could give me some information of what evidence there was 
that he had systemic lupus and neuropsychiatric lupus back in 2103 at 
the Vermilion Hospital, for instance the discharge summary from the Vermilion Hospital, that would be appreciated.

RE:Craft, Lloyd
MRN:26649180
 
Dear Dr. Short:
 
Today I had the delight of seeing your patient Mr. Craft for the 
possibility of central nervous system vasculitis.  As you know, he 
is a 64 year old, right-handed man with an extensive past medical 
history for a rheumatological disease.  His past medical history, 
briefly, is that he was diagnosed with lupus in 2103 and at that 
time he had a butterfly rash, he complained of chronic fatigue and 
he also had what was considered temporal lobe seizures which were 
characterized as complex partial type events, and elevated double-
stranded DNA of 1:80 and ANA of 1:512 with a homogenous pattern.  
All of these suggested that the patient did have lupus.  He was 
treated for approximately three years with prednisone and he notes 
that after medications were added by Dr. Taliyah Hoffman, his 
symptoms and seizures went away.  Since that time, he has had a 
recurrence of symptoms which includes fullness of his face and 
neck, pressure within his head.  He considers himself to have 
vascular headaches with facial weakness, ringing in his ears, 
numbness and tingling of his left hand and arm, excessive 
salivation and increased appetite. In describing his headache, he 
noted that it is primarily a headache which is there every day and 
has a combination of throbbing sensation as well as throbbing 
quality.  It is worse in the frontal temporal area and is not 
associated with nausea, vomiting or paraesthesias.  There is no 
family history of migraines as well.  Also during his headache 
events, he does not notice any decrease in his appetite or any 
nausea or vomiting.
 
Past medical history:  As per above.  Medicval issues include 
bipolar II with ____________ diagnosed in 2110, hypothalamic 
gonadism, hypothalamic hypothyroidism and questionable history of 
migraine headaches.  
 
His current medications include Lamictal, Risperdal, testolactone, 
chromisene, Levoxyl, Altace for hypertension, ibuprofen p.r.n. and 
prednisone p.r.n.  
 
He is allergic to penicillin, Lozol, bee stings and allopurinol.  
There is a questionable history to Aricept which he feels that the 
use of this medication made his current symptoms come out of 
remission.

Family history is remarkable for insulin dependent diabetes 
mellitus in father and father also had heart disease.  
 
Social history:  He is a former stage manager.  
 
Neurological exam:  He was awake, alert, oriented x 3.  Attention 
was normal.  Speech was fluent, without dysarthria or paraphasic 
errors.  There is no memory deficit or agnosia.  The patient gave 
a very detailed history of events and no further detailed mental 
status testing was performed.  Cranial nerves:  Bilateral visual 
fields were full.  Disks were sharp.  Fundus was clear.  
Extraocular movements were intact.  There was no nystagmus.  He 
had normal facial sensation and symmetry.  Hearing was grossly 
normal.  Uvula, tongue and palate were midline.  Motor examination 
revealed normal tone and bulk with normal strength.  Deep tendon 
reflexes were symmetrical.  There was no upper motor neuron sign.  
Coordination and gait were normal.  
 
Overall impression:  64 year old, right-handed male with a history 
of lupus in the past.  His recent blood work shows that his 
double-stranded DNA was negative.  Taking into consideration his 
current constellation of symptoms and his MRI reports that I 
evaluated which were completely normal except for small vascular 
disease, at this time he does not fit with the diagnosis of 
central nervous system vasculitis.  He was told that he is at a 
high risk for having a stroke secondary to (1) having high blood 
pressure and (2) having an elevated cholesterol.  If it is 
possible to maintain his blood pressure in good control and start 
a cholesterol-lowering agent, he is to discuss this with you, and 
also consider starting aspirin 81mg PO q.d. for primary prevention 
of heart disease.  He was informed that it is possible that there 
is some element of his immune system fluctuations and possibly his 
hormonal therapies may be contributing to some of his 
symptomatology but the diagnosis or etiology of these symptoms is 
not clear.  
 
Thank you for letting me take part in your patient's healthcare.
 
Sincerely,

Neurology Attending Staff:


July 8, 2122
Time of exam 1:05 PM
Patient: Lloyd Coleman
Reason for admission: headache, gait instability, mental slowness


I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Craft who has been admitted to the Neurology service for evaluation and management.  Along with the Neurology Residents, I personally interviewed, examined, and counseled the patient, confirmed the history and findings, reviewed records and studies, and discussed the impression and recommendations.  For greater details of H/P/ROS/meds/exam/labs/studies, and assessment &amp; plan, please refer to the neurology resident admit note by Dr. Robert Neil (and below under my assessment). 


ROS performed across 10 systems are negative (as noted in neurology note) except as noted in Hx/Assessment and resident's note. 


Cognitive and Elemental neurologic exam as noted in neurology resident note. 
Of note, AFVSS, was asleep but awoke to voice and became alert, attentive to examiner, but had moderate psychomotor retardation. Was slowly conversant and followed simple multiple step commands across midline. 
Oriented to time/date/place. 
Great d/w simple attention (MOY backwards only to Nov, skipped Oct went to September and then went forwards again). 
Able to perform complex attention and working memory bihemispheric Newberry location alpha-numeric task after a second trial. 
Language: fluent w/o dysarthria. Farily Intact naming for high and low frequency items except clasp and had some mild retrieval d/w. 
Memory: gives good details of recent events including hospitalizations. 
Leprosarium name and address: 5/5 registration --&gt; 2/5 recall in 5 min --&gt; 1/3 recognition from a list
Presidential candidates = Xayarath and Golden
Calculations: # of quarters in $6.75 = 27
Moderate d/w Luria fist-side-palm that improved w/ verbal cuing but still poor L&gt;R. 
No EDSS, neglect, R-L confusion or apraxia. 
Mood: ""low ... my daughter has cancer that spread to the bones""; Affect: congruent. 


CN's II-XII intact, good up and down gaze and w/o IV or VI CN palsy. 
No PND, abnl movements, tremor, asterixis, or UE ataxia. Slow but okay FFM, FNF, RAM. 
Full MS, nl DTR's and tone. Plantar responses flexor. 
Mildly diminished stocking distributaion of LT/Cold/VS both legs to mid-shins. HKS mild d/w. 
Unable to stand w/ feet together even w/ eyes open. Moderate retropulsion trying to stand and moderate to severe retropulsion w/o spontaneously recovery on pull-test. Narraw base, small step size w/ low steppage, cautious and w/ retropulsion, slow rate w/ 10 step en bloc turning w/ imbalance (backwards). 
No photo- or phono-phobia, no nuchal rigidity.


Labs/Studies: of note BUN 21, Cr 1.2, MCV 95, Hct 41.6, wbc 13.3


Neuroimaging: Personally reviewed HCT - mildly large vents, no s/o SDH or SAH or infarct/mass lx/hemorrhage. 


Assessment:: Likely Communicating Hydrocephalus with mild elevation of ICP in context of minor head trauma.  On exam shows psychomotor retardation, d/w concentration, retrieval (including memory and words), frontal fucntions including set-switching on Lurias, and working memory. He also has moderate retropulsion on exam worse on pull-test than spontaneously, and hypomimia. His vents are mildly dilated in context of general cerebral atrophy that is not o/w out-of-proportion for his advanced age. Onset of his sx's including bilateral headache described as constant 6-8/10 pressure at posterior vertex w/ occ. radiation foward made worse by lying down for some time (worse in the mornings) and better in the afternoons or after sitting or standing. No blurred vision but mild nausea w/o vomiting. No nuchal rigidity or photo-phonophobia. No f/c/ns/cp/sob/rash/weakness/changes in sensation. Describes very clear psychomotor retardation since first fall including d/w concentraion, memory and word retrieval, and extreme slowness in mental processing (including reading - used to be a speed reader and now reads one word at a time very slowly). He's had some urinary urgency but no incontinencey. Describes his d/w gait as not being able to get his legs to do what he wants them to do despite having good strength. Additionally, feels that he's always losing his balance backwards. No suggestion of meningoencephalitis, stroke or seizure. Had mild bilat tinnitus but no vertigo. Does ascribe rare very transient visual distortion and object movement (up/down). WBC mildly elevated but no fever and U/A and CXR are negative. 


Overall, there is a diad of gait apraxia and frontal cognitive dysfunction and psychomotor retardation (no urinary incontinence) in context of sx's of mildly elevated ICP and mildly enlarged vents. Has a mild small and large fiber distal symmetric polyneuropathy which exacerbates his gait difficulties. He is also at least mildly anxious and moderately anxious.  Had bradycardia in ED - now better but need to follow. 


Plan: 

- Optimize pain/headache control
- Neuro checks q4hrs
- Cardiac telemetry
- Elevated ICP (mild) precautions with HOB &gt; 45 degrees; and gentle hydration (he is dehydrated by labs)
- MRI of brain to better assess vents and possible transependymal flow, as well as to exclude much less likely brainstem and posterior fossa lesions. Also need to assess posterior circulation w/ MRA (had mild constant tinnutus), and assess for small SDH (b/o h/o head trauma). 
- check B12, homocysteine, TSH, ESR, hsCRP, ANA

- After Brain MRI is reviewed, need to assess fundi, gait and cognition (formally score and time) and then perform diagnostic LP for hydrocephalus -- measuring opening and closing pressure after removing ~ 20cc and sending for cell count, glucose, TP, and xanthochromia as well as keeping ~ 10 cc. 

- Hold sotalol, complete cardiac/MI r/o by enzymes. 
- Follow wbc and monitor for s/s infection. 


Discussed assessment and plan with pt and family who understand and agree.

History of present illness   This is a 54-year-old white male here complaining persistent cough.  He has had a dry cough for about two months.  He was put on inhalers, but there was no improvement.  The cough is worse at night, but also he has it during the day.  He has no mucus production, no hemoptysis, no shortness of breath, and no wheezing.  He is a nonsmoker.  About a week ago, he was admitted to a local emergency room for chest pain.  He was rushed to Ochiltree General because of ST-T wave abnormalities on his EKG.  In retrospect, he has had these changes for many years, and anyway he had a cardiac catheterization, which showed mild obstruction of some of his coronary systems but no evidence of coronary artery syndrome.  He did have cardiomyopathy with the ejection fraction of 35%.  He was sent home on Toprol XL 50 mg QD, Lipitor 10 mg QD, lisinopril 10 mg, aspirin 325 mg once a day, and Avandia 2 mg once a day.  Since returning home, the patient feels no chest pain or shortness of breath.  No orthopnea or PND.  He still has a dry cough.

	Reason for visit:
   The patient is a 61 yo Equadorian male admitted for cardiac cath after an episode of chest pain with? positive markers.


	Interval History:
   The  patient was  transferred to OGH in 3/2067 because of chest pain with positive markers and aaaanterolateral T wave changes.At which time he was diagnosed with possible ETOH myocarditis. His EF was 34%. He underwent cardiac cath which showed that the Left Main and LAD were patent, , a very distal LCX lesion. RCA was dominant and patent. The patient was discharged to home on a program of ace, BB, ASA and instructed to curtail his ETOH use. His EF improved to 66 %. He had repeat nuclear stress testing which showed small anterior infarct/small prior inferior infarct and was negative for ischemia in July 2068..
   Since then he has had a stable angina pattern with chest pain brought on when he has to move very heavy objects in his work as a packager . This is usually relieved with one TNG. Most recently, he was seen by his PC Dr. Thomson and treated with Augmentin/Robitussin AC for a URI. He had a productive cough  and some chest discomfort related to coughing. 
   Most recently, he was brought into police custody for public intoxication. While in his jail cell,""resting"" he developed the sudden onset on midsternal sharp chest pain accompanied by heavy breathing. There was no radiation to the arms, but he noted bilateral hand numbness. He also had palpitations and sweating and felt nauseated. He received one sl TNG. An ambulance was called and he received 2 TNG sprays. His pain diminished. His BP was 176/100 at the time. He was brought to the Evanston Hospital ER and found to have ""high lateral changes"" on his EKG's. Troponins were slightly elevated at .13- considered a ""gray zone"" for the hospitals range  for MI. The patient was pain free after a dose of Morphine. While in the hospital, he was placed on suicide watch. He has a history of a suicide attempt 3 years ago and has previously had counseling and been on antidepressants. He has a son who is in a vegetative state after an MVA whom he helps care for and this is very stressful. His recent arrest made hiite despondent. At Evanston Hospital, he was started on a beta blocker and Lovenox. He had a suboptimal stress test which was stopped because of SSCP and nausea. He is now transferred to OGH for further evaluation.

	Assessment and plan:
   The patient is a 47 yo diabetic, with known CAD, improved EF after d/c of ETOH now admitted after episode of chest pain with ? EKG changes and  ""intermediate""Troponins per local hospital assay.Case reviewed with Dr. Levine. Would continue ASA, beta Blocker and Lisinopril in addition to usual meds. He has previous CAD and is diabetic. Even though stess test was suboptimal, he has risk factors of diabetes, obesity and hypertension, and 50 % LCX lesion , so would proceed with cath tomorrow. NPO after midnight for cath lab. He is currently pain free so no heparin for now. Would check serial EKG;s, and troponins in addition to usual labs. Please obtain fasting cholesterol panel.

Will need psychiatric consult to aseess suicidality though he currently denies this.

Agree hold NSAIDs/Voltaren intil after cath.

	Note: There is an addendum for this note (6/10/2097)
		


	Reason for visit:
   Mr. Bell is an 81 year old male with recent CABG, now admitted via EW with progressive shortness of breath and hypoxia for further evaluation.


	Interval History:
   He has multiple cardiac risk factors and a history of CAD dating back to April 2097. At that point, he noted increasing chest pressure and dyspnea on minimal exertion. Following a positive stress test, he was admitted for cardiac catheterization. Coronary angiography revealed severe multi vessel CAD. He had an IABP placed and underwent cardiac surgical evaluation. Carotid non-invasive studies revealed a moderate right carotid lesion with mild left carotid disease. 

He underwent a 4 vessel CABG by Dr. Troyer. His graft anatomy includes a LIMA to the LAD, SVG to the PDA and PLV and a SVG to the OM branch. He required re-exploration for bleeding. He also had atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, treated with Amiodarone. His IABP was removed a few days post operatively. He developed new anterior ST changes, and an echocardiogram revealed a marked decline in his LV function from 66% to 19%. 

He was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab. Coronary angiography revealed a widely patent SVG to OM, a 30% ostial lesion in the SVG to the PDA and PLV. The LIMA was patent, but there was no flow into the distal LAD. He underwent stenting of the LIMA anastomosis into the LAD with a 2.5mm x 18mm, 2.5mm x 12mm and 2.5mm x 12mm MiniVision stents. 

His post cardiac surgical course was further complicated by a Serratia pneumonia and a transient worsening renal function. He also required sternal rewiring for sternal instability. He was followed by Dr. Hardin. His HIT assay was borderline negative. He was also found to have a factor VII deficiency, and was treated with argatroban. Lower extremity non-invasive studies revealed a R posterior tibial DVT, and he was discharged on Fopndaparinux. A follow up echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 31% with apical akinesis, with only mild mitral regurgitation. He was discharged to rehab on post operative day 20. 

He was discharged from rehab on June 5th. On June 7th he was lightheaded and found to be hypotensive by the VNA. His systolic pressures were 78 to 90 mmHg, and his lisinopril was decreased and his Lasix dose was cut in half. He denies any chest discomfort, throat or arm discomfort or palpitations. He denies any PND, but has been sleeping in a hospital bed with the head elevated 45 degrees. The family updated the office earlier this morning - 2 pound weight gain and shortness of breath. His Lasix was increased to 40 mg bid. However, when seen by VNA, his room air saturation was 76%. 911 was called and he was brought to WGCC ED for evaluation. 



	Past medical history:
   CM/CAD as described, Hypertension, Type II DM x 15 yrs- with nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy, Mild renal insufficiency, PVD, Carotid disease, Factor VII Deficiency, BPH, Hearing loss, Vitamin B12 deficiency.

	Assessment and plan:
   CM/CAD - with recent CABG and coronary stenting, now admitted via the EW with dyspnea and hypoxia. Initial cardiac enzyme screen is negative, but BNP markedly elevated. Based on exam, suspect a combination of CHF and pleural effusions (diuretic medication was not being taken at prescribed dose accidentally). Will admit for diuresis, if significant effusion not improving with diuretics, may need thoracentesis. If BP allows, will resume low dose ACEI tomorrow. Check echocardiogram to assess EF and pericardial effusion. continue aspirin and Plavix. 

Recent DVT - on Fondaparinux - please continue and ask Dr. Hardin to see while in-patient (known to him). 

DM - continue current regimen, follow and cover as needed.

PCP: Lord, Dana  



ID/CC:	GI Bleed



HPI:  	 69 yo man w/ h/o AAA, PVD, CAD, AF w/ tracheostomy and G-tube in place, on coumadin for PVD, HIT +,  and DVT w/ INR yesterday of 5.3.  Noticed black stools x 1 day, and blood suctioned form G-tube.  Came to ED and while in ED waiting for a room had an episode of  near syncope. In ED 97.6, Pulse 82, BP 110/62 RR 20. In ED received 4 units FFP, 2 uPRBCs, and Zantac.  GI saw him then and EGD showed large clot in fundus of stomach, but unable to find source of active bleeding.  Duodenum was visualized up to the 3rd portion was normal.

	Shortly after transfer to floor he  was noted to have hematemesis, then became pulseless and went into Vfib arrest.  Pt trached and was bagged.  After cardioversion x 2, he reverted to sinus rhythm which again returned to asystole.  After 1 mg of epinephrine he regained pulse and rhythm was sinus tachycardia.  Triple lumen placed in R groin and Cordis in L groin.  EKG w/ ST depressions in lateral leads.  

	Repeat EGD in MICU showed ulcer 2 cm from GE junction w/ protrusion and question of visible vessel.  Angioectasia / active oozing.  Both tx'd c/ bipolar resulting in good hemostasis.

a/p: weight gain is concerning to me as he has h/o increased blood sugars: advised him to try to lose 10 lbs, we'll check his hga1c and fasting sugar again as well. I'm concerned that he will end up need ing medication for this if he continues to gain weight.  



his lipids were up last check, but his daughter recollects that he ate a full breakfast prior to that lab draw.. will repeat fasting.



htn: in good control



cad: pt to see cardiology next wednesday.  I advised him he would probably need a statin if LDL isn't in the 60's fasting again.

PONTIAC INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Sherman, Andrew
 
 
 
History of Present Illness:  The patient returns one week after being 
seen here initially in Internal Medicine clinic.  On the last visit he was having 
chest pain and was therefore sent to the Emergency Room for a further 
evaluation.  At that time he had EKGs which did not demonstrate any 
ischemia during his chest pain and a chest x-ray which was unremarkable.  
The Emergency Room physicians contacted his doctors at Humbert Hospital and obtained a history that the patient had a cardiomyopathy in 
the past with a decreased LV function.  However repeat echo within the 
past months demonstrated good LV function and they were in the process 
of performing further cardiac testing when the patient left the 
Humbert Hospital against medical advice.  After being evaluated in the 
Emergency Room at Pontiac State, he now returns to be tied in with 
the Internal Medicine clinic.  
 
Medications:  His medications since his Emergency Room visit include 
Carafate 1 gm. PO q.i.d., Prinivil 10 mg. PO q.d., Tenormin 50 mg. PO 
q.d., Motrin 600 mg. t.i.d. p.r.n. and Nitrostat tablets p.r.n.  His 
insulin dosing consists of 40 units of NPH q.a.m. and 18 units q.p.m. 
and regular insulin 20 units q.a.m.  
 
On return to my office today, he states that the frequency of his chest 
pain is much diminished but that he has gained some weight since 
discontinuing his Lasix per order of the Emergency Room physicians.
 
Physical Exam:  On exam, his blood pressure is 160/100 with a heart rate 
of 76.  He is not in any acute distress.  His chest is clear to 
auscultation.  His cardiac exam demonstrates S4 gallop and distant heart 
sounds.  His abdominal exam is benign except for massive obesity.  His 
rectal exam is guaiac negative.  His extremities exam demonstrates 1+ 
pitting edema to the shins and his neurologic exam is unremarkable.  
 
Assessment and Plan:  
 
1.   Cardiac.  The patient will be scheduled for an ETT thallium study 
     to rule out ischemia.
 
2.   Hypertension.  His Prinivil will be increased to 20 mg. q.d.
 
3.   Diabetes.  His sugars have been running 130 to 160 by fingerstick 
     checks at home and he will continue his present regimen.
 
4.   The patient will be referred to ophthalmology for the evaluation of 
     his eyes given his history of hypertension and diabetes.
 
5.   General.  The patient will see me shortly after completion of an 
     ETT thallium study for further discussion of his cardiac status.

PONTIAC INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Sherman, Andrew
                                              7-21-79
 
 
 
History of Present Illness:  Mr. Sherman is a patient well known to 
me.  I have seen him on multiple occasions for his coronary artery 
disease, hypertension, and diabetes.  The patient has had a positive 
exercise tolerance test recently and was seen by Cardiology who felt 
that he should undergo cardiac catheterization.  However, patient was 
overweight and the decision was made for him to reduce his weight by 
approximately 50 lb. at which time he would be suitable for cardiac 
catheterization on the Pontiac equipment.  Patient was seen last night 
in the Pontiac Emergency Room with a several day history of back pain 
which began in the middle of his back and has subsequently become right 
flank pain which is persistent and colicky in nature.  
 
On exam in the Emergency Room he was noted to be afebrile.  His exam was 
notable for CVA tenderness and an exam highly suspicious of renal colic.  
His EKG was unremarkable and his laboratory exam was unremarkable as 
well.  His urinalysis did not demonstrate any red blood cells, however, 
did have 3+ uric acid crystals with a normal uric acid blood level.  An 
abdominal ultrasound was ordered which was unremarkable except for the 
presence of his slight abnormality in the right pole of a kidney.  IVP 
was recommended by the radiologist for follow-up.  He was given Toradol 
in the Emergency Room with minimal improvement and sent home with some 
Motrin with the follow-up to be by me in Internal Medicine Clinic.  I was called by 
the patient this morning complaining of worsening pain in his right 
flank.  On it, patient states he is unable to get out of bed and was 
brought to the Pontiac State Hospital to my Internal Medicine Clinic.  On exam 
he was afebrile and his exam was notable for a right CVA tenderness with 
pain radiating around to his abdomen and exacerbated by pushing on his 
abdomen.  Patient has good bowel sounds throughout and there are no 
peritoneal signs.
 
Assessment and Plan:  While I am concerned about his possible renal 
pathology I believe that there is a significant chance that this may be 
musculoskeletal in nature, however, due to his other medical problems I 
feel that an intravenous pyelogram is definitely indicated and he will 
undergo this study this afternoon.  I have also sent off a repeat CBC 
with differential, a repeat urinalysis and amylase and lipase levels to 
rule out pancreatitis.  Of note, patient does have a history of peptic 
ulcer disease, however, he was guaiac negative in the Emergency Room and 
reports no episodes of hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena.  He is also 
status post cholecystectomy.  I will review his IVP later today and make 
further therapeutic interventions at that time.

EKG:   septal Q wave. NSR.



CXR: no pulmonary edema.  



Head CT: 1.  There is a region of low attenuation in the left occipital

lobe which may represent a subacute infarct.  MRI of the brain with DWI would be helpful for further characterization. 2.  Right maxillary sinus and nondisplaced right orbital floor fractures, as described above. 3.  Mild atrophy and nonspecific white-matter change likely

related to microangiopathic-small vessel ischemic change. 4.  Old left thalamic infarct.





A/P:  57 yoM w/ MMP presenting with syncope and facial fracture. Appears to have recurrent syncope of unclear etiology.  Cardiac etiology would be of greatest concern given hx of CAD and chest pain, though certainly cerebrovascular disease is present given CVA history.



Plan:

1. Neuro: hx of CVA on ASA

-MRI/MRA to r/o vertebrobasilar disease

2. PULM: CPAP at night for OSA

3. COR: ROMI, interrogate pacer, holter monitor, ASA, ACE, BB, Zocor

4.ENDO: RISS

5.RENAL: gentle IVF for elevated creatinine likely pre-renal etiology

6.DISPO: SS consult. Obtain MR to see what w/u has been done for patient at SHH for syncope.

RE: HEATH, QUINTEN M
      MRN: 8059475
      DOB: 08/02/2095


Dear Dr. Calhoun;


We had the pleasure of seeing your patient Quinten Heath today in Internal Medicine in followup for osteoporosis and hypogonadism. 


As you know Mr. Heat is a pleasant 76-year-old man with a history of esophageal cancer status post surgery in 2169, chemotherapy and radiation who had back pain prompting imaging that revealed several vertebral compression fractures and his BMD was consistent with osteoporosis with a T score of minus 4.2 in the lumbar spine and minus 2.3 in the femoral neck. 


We. started zoledronic acid IV in 05/2171 that he tolerated fine. 


In addition, we discovered primary hypogonadism with testosterone levels around 45 mg/dL and elevated FSH and LH levels. We started AndroGel therapy for testosterone replacement and appeared that he is taking every day.  He does not really feel any better or stronger with this medication. 


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
1. Osteoporosis. 
2. Hypogonadism. 
3. History of esophageal cancer status post esophagectomy in 2169, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 
4. Gastroesophageal reflux disease. 
5. Hypertension. 
6. Diabetes type 2. 
7. Carotid artery disease, left. 
8. Hypercholesterolemia. 
9. Status post AAA repair in 2165. 
10. Coronary artery disease with status post stent. 


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He is anxious because he has some swallowing problems and fears that his esophageal disease is acting up and he is anticipating a CAT scan in a few days. 


MEDICATIONS: Tricor, metoprolol, Prilosec, Lipitor, aspirin, Plavix, Isordil, Zoloft, vitamin C, Centrum Caltrate plus D 600 mg twice a day, zoledronic acid 4 mg IV once a year and AndroGel 5 grams once a day. 


ALLERGIES: Tape. 


SOCIAL HISTORY: He is married and has 3 children. 


Vital signs: Blood pressure 118/48, pulse 68, weight 136 pounds. Height 5 feet 4 inches. 


LABORATORY EVALUATION: His testosterone level on AndroGel is normal at 292 mg/dL (normal 195-1138) on 09/13/2171. His hematocrit is 39. It was 37 in 02/2171.. Platelets are 179,000. White count 4.8. 


In summary, Mr. Heath is a 76-year-old man with osteoporosis and compression fractures probably secondary to hypogonadism and therapy for esophageal cancer. The cause of hypogonadism is probably the chemotherapy. I asked him again to see a urologist to rule out other causes of primary hypogonadism. 


He will continue the current treatment with calcium, vitamin D, testosterone and antiresorptive therapy of his yearly zoledronic acid. 
We will repeat a BMD in 2 years from now. 


Please let me know if you have any questions. 


Yours sincerely,

RADIATION ONCOLOGY FOLLOW-UP NOTE


HEATH, QUINTEN M. 805-94-75


REFERRING PHYSICIAN: Fred Quebedeaux, M.D.


DATE OF VISIT: 2/4/2173


REASON FOR VISIT: Reassessment of progress, s/p postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy in combination with concurrent chemotherapy for esophageal adenocarcinoma, T2N1 stage IIB, s/p left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy (12/01/69) with pathologic tumor stage T2N1M0 (3/23 involved lymph nodes).


POSTOPERATIVE RADIATION THERAPY:  For the presence of metastatic disease in regional lymph nodes, he was judged a candidate for postoperative adjuvant chemo-radiation therapy.  He was treated with a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions to the tumor bed region using IMRT, planned with 4D CT simulation.  This treatment was administered in combination with chemotherapy between March 29, 2170, and Apr 30, 2170.  


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Quinten Heath is a 77 year-old gentleman with a history of smoking, chronic GERD, HTN, CAD s/p PCI, partially blocked L carotid artery and AAA repair x 2.  He was in his USOH until 8/69 when he began to have difficulty swallowing.  While eating a hamburger he felt it lodge in his chest with accompanying retrosternal discomfort and increased salivation.  He has had about a dozen similar episodes since then, which have generally resolved within 10-15 minutes without regurgitation.  In 9/69 his PCP prescribed a PPI, which helped somewhat, but he continued to have dysphagia.  On 10/16/69 EGD at Griffin Hospital demonstrated a partially-obstructing distal esophageal mass 34-39 cm from the incisors, associated with Barrett&#8217;s esophagus, with pathology significant for well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma.  On 10/17/69 CT of the chest and abdomen showed prominent thickening of the distal esophagus.  On 10/21/69 repeat CT of the chest showed an 8 mm LLL nodule and R-sided pleural thickening.  Upper EUS showed a partially obstructing esophageal mass extending from 35-40 cm with 9 mm thickness, suggestive of invasion to the muscularis propria, one suspicious mediastinal LN, and porta hepatis adenopathy.  On 10/22 FNA of a porta hepatis LN was negative.


He underwent a left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy on 12/1/69. Pathology showed an ulcerated tumor measuring 4.0x3.5x0.8 cm, invading into muscularis propria (pT2) and metastasis to 3 of 27 LN (N1).  


INTERVAL HISTORY/REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
He has been doing well without significant GI or respiratory symptoms.
He has maintained steady energy and appetite.
He has had mild dysphagia for solid and meat. Otherwise, he has been doing well.
He denies significant respiratory symptoms. No focal or generalized neurological symptoms. The remainder of review of systems was unremarkable.

Re:	Jarome DEJESUS

	ECI 280-44-07-1



Dear Dr. Ponce:



I had the pleasure of caring for Mr. Dejesus during his ECI admission 05/16-07/14.  He is a 72-year-old man with CAD S/P diagnostic cath one week ago at SCMHC, found to have a moderately tight lesion in the LAD without significant disease in the left circumflex or RCA.  Because of the recent onset of angina and a stress test showing anterior ischemia, he was brought to ECI, where Dr. Yoseph Flint stented the LAD lesion with a 3.5mm by 32mm Taxus drug-eluting stent, with zero percent residual.  The right femoral arteriotomy was closed with an Angioseal, and there were no complications.  



He spent an uneventful evening without complaints, ambulating without difficulty.  His left groin was soft without hematoma or bruit, and extremities were warm and well perfused.  Morning labs included a BUN of 17, creatinine 0.9, hematocrit 37, platelets 236,000, and flat cardiac enzymes.  He was discharged home on Plavix, 75mg po qd for a minimum of six months; enteric-coated aspirin, 325mg po qd; digoxin, 0.25mg po qd; glyburide, 5mg po bid; metoprolol, 50mg po bid; Lipitor, 20mg po qd; Tikosyn, 500mcg po bid; Glucophage, to be resumed at 500mg po bid in two days; and Coumadin, to be resumed tonight.  He has PT/INR check arranged in several days.  He will follow up with you in the next two weeks, and will see his PMD, Dr. Paige, in the near future.  Thank you for allowing us to participate in his care.  Please call if you have questions.



Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Berg:

We had the pleasure of caring for your patient, Jarome Dejesus, during his admission to the Erie County Infirmary from 07/16/2157 to 07/17/2157 for evaluation and treatment of his anginal symptoms.  As you know, Mr. Dejesus is a very pleasant 74-year-old gentleman with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who is on Coumadin.  He has a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia.  He has known coronary artery disease and underwent stenting of his left anterior descending artery in 05/2155, at which time he had a Taxus drug-eluting stent placed.  He returns now with increasing dyspnea on exertion and had an elective cardiac catheterization performed at the Southwest Colorado Medical on 07/13/2157 that showed focal 90% instent restenosis in the left anterior descending artery with no other focally occlusive disease.  He was transferred to the Erie County Infirmary and on the afternoon of 07/16/2157, Dr. Yoseph Flint was able to dilate and stent the lesion in the left anterior descending artery with placement of a 3.5 x 28 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent.  The procedure was complicated by brief transient no re-flow that resolved immediately to intracoronary nitroglycerin.  The left femoral arteriotomy was closed using an Angio-Seal device.  Mr. Dejesus has spent an uneventful evening on our Cardiovascular Service.  He has had no complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath.  He is ambulating, eating, and voiding without difficulty.

His heart rate has been in the 70s, blood pressure in the 110s/60.  He is in atrial fibrillation.  His cardiac exam was irregular with no appreciable murmur.  His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His left groin is moderately ecchymotic but soft.  There is no hematoma or bruit.  Extremities are warm and well perfused.

His morning labs revealed a sodium of 138, potassium of 4.9, BUN of 21, creatinine of 1.2.  His total CK is 58 with a CK-MB of 0.4.  His hematocrit is stable at 38, white count of 9, platelets of 300,000.  His fasting lipid panel showed a total cholesterol 123 with an HDL of 25, LDL of 49, and triglycerides of 244.

We are discharging him home on the following medications:  Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily, which must be continued for a minimum of the next three months, aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily is to be backed off to 81 mg after a few months.  He will resume his Coumadin at 5 mg daily, and have this checked with his primary care physician, Dr. Paige.  He will be on Lipitor 20 mg p.o. daily, digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. daily, Tikosyn 500 mcg p.o. b.i.d., glyburide 5 mg p.o. daily, Avandia 4 mg p.o. daily, Diovan 80 mg p.o. daily, NPH insulin 16 units each evening and sublingual nitroglycerin to be used as needed for chest pain.  We have asked him to arrange a followup appointment with you within the next couple of weeks and to see Robert-Joseph Paige in the near future also.  Thank you very much for allowing us to participate in the care of this pleasant gentleman, and please do not hesitate to contact us with any issues regarding his ongoing management.

With warmest regards.

Southwest Colorado Medical Health Center

Suite 975

Robstown, NE  29768





Dear Dr. Dill:



DOB:  10/11/2082



Thank you for referring Mr. Dejesus to the Erie County Arrhythmia Service for consideration of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation.



As you know him well, I will summarize his history briefly for our records.  Mr. Dejesus is a 78-year-old gentleman with an extensive cardiac history that includes coronary artery disease status post multiple percutaneous coronary interventions and stents to the LAD as well as RCA territories, a cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately 35-40%, and atrial fibrillation.  In addition, he has multiple cardiac risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea.  In addition to disease in his coronary vascular bed, he has a history of carotid disease status post left CEA.



He came to your attention early this year with symptoms of exertional dyspnea.  On further questioning, he reports feeling quite symptomatic when ambulating relatively short distances around his home or up and down the driveway.  He can walk no further than approximately 50-100 feet before developing significant shortness of breath and fatigue.  He was recently diagnosed as having paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that has transitioned to persistent.  He has undergone multiple cardioversions most recently in 03/19/2161, but was unsuccessful.  Prior to that, cardioversion in February resulted in a brief period of restoration of sinus rhythm during which time he felt symptomatically improved.  He also describes occasional fleeting episodes of sharp left-sided chest discomfort.  Cardiac catheterization on 01/18/2161 revealed a 30% LAD in-stent restenosis, 90% septal lesion, and 65% -70% PDA lesion that was stented.  A Ventriculogram at that time revealed an EF of 35-40%.



Other than significant exertional shortness of breath, he feels relatively well.  He has occasional symptoms of orthostatic lightheadedness but no history of syncope.  He denies any PND, orthopnea, or lower extremity swelling.  He has no history of heart failure hospitalizations.  His weight has been stable.



On review of systems, he denies any fevers, chills, or night sweats.  His weight has remained stable.  He denies any new onset cough, wheezing, or hemoptysis.



Past Medical History:

1.  CAD status post LAD PCI/stenting in 2155.  He developed in-stent restenosis in 07/2157, during which time he received a second drug-eluting stent to the LAD lesion.  He developed recurrent chest discomfort in 12/2159, and he underwent cardiac catheterization during which time he was found to have an 80% mid LAD lesion distal to his prior stents as well as a 30% proximal RCA mid PDA stenosis.  He underwent a drug-eluting stent to the mid LAD lesion.  A followup catheterization in 01/2161 revealed a 30% LAD stenosis, 90% large septal branch lesion, and a 65-70% proximal PDA stenosis.  Ventriculogram revealed an EF of 35-40%.  He underwent stenting to the PDA lesion on 03/06/2161.  An exercise Myoview performed in 01/2160 revealed no evidence of inducible ischemia.

2.  Hypertension.

3.  Dyslipidemia.

4.  Diabetes.

5.  Obstructive sleep apnea.

6.  COPD, prescribed home oxygen, though he is not taking this.

7.  Carotid disease, status post left CEA after presenting with an ipsilateral episode of amaurosis fugax.

8.? History of BLANK AAA by ultrasound in 07/2159.

9.  Atrial fibrillation.

10.  Obesity.



He has no known drug allergies.



His current medications include amiodarone 200 mg BLANK, but this has been discontinued since April, metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d., digoxin 0.25 mg daily, Zocor 20 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, TriCor 145 mg daily, Lasix 20 mg daily, BLANK 5 mg nightly, aspirin 325 mg daily, Lantus insulin 62 units daily, Humalog insulin, and Protonix 40 mg daily.



His social history is notable for remote history of tobacco dependence.  He was formally employed in buidling construction.  He has multiple environmental exposures including insulation as well as spray paint and without respiratory protection.  He does not currently smoke or drink alcohol.



His family history is negative for early onset CAD, sudden cardiac death, or cardiomyopathy.  His father lived until the age of 88.  His mother died of a stroke at the age of 80.  He has a single sister who is 86 years of age and has no history of heart troubles.



Physical Examination:  His blood pressure is 115/60 BLANK of 66 beats per minute.  In general, he is overweight elderly man in no distress.  Sitting upright his jugular venous pressure is below the clavicles.  Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally.  Lungs are notable for a few crackles at the bases, but otherwise clear.  There is no wheezing.  Cardiac exam reveals an irregular rate with a variable S1 and S2.  There is no audible murmur, rub or gallop.  Abdomen is obese, soft, and nontender.  Lower extremities are warm and well perfused.  There is trace pitting edema at the ankles.



Recent blood work reveals an INR of 2.2 on 05/28/2161.



EKG today reveals atrial fibrillation at a rate of approximately 66 beats per minute.  There are some nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, but otherwise no evidence of prior infarct or ST changes.  There is some low voltage in the limb leads, though I suspect this is related to his habitus.



Overall, Mr. Dejesus is a pleasant 78-year-old man with a complex prior medical history who appears to have persistent atrial fibrillation with a principal functional limitation of exertional shortness of breath.  He appears to be functional class III.  He does not have any frank evidence of volume overload on exam today, though his ventricular function and is not entirely normal.  Moreover, he has multiple comorbidities which may exacerbate his exertional dyspnea including COPD and coronary artery disease.



We discussed atrial fibrillation with Mr. Dejesus and his family today.  We explained that the brief period of normal sinus rhythm associated with symptomatic improvement may be a reason to proceed with catheter ablation.  However, given his comorbidities and the presence of persistent arrhythmia we warned that a single catheter ablation procedure may not be entirely successful and that waiting period of approximately 3-4 month post-ablation may be required to adjudicate success.  Given the length of the procedure as well as his comorbidities, we feel reasonable to consult with our anesthesia colleagues for possible consideration of performing the procedure under general anesthesia versus with MAC and had procedural sedation.  We will leave this decision to them.  Moreover, prior to the ablation, we will request a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out left atrial clot prior to ablation.



Thank you very much for referring Mr. Dejesus to our care.  We will be in touch following the procedure.  As always, feel free to call with any questions.



Sincerely,

Reason for Visit	

Comprehensive physical exam and ongoing management of multiple medical problems.



Problems	  

Congestive heart failure	      

He had admission to MCH 9/87 with CHF.  He was started on Carvedilol and Spironolactone during that visit.  He was aggressively diuresed with marked improvement in his symptoms.  Beta blocker was reduced during that admission as well.  Most recent echo from 5/02/88 showed severely depressed LV systolic function, EF 30%, global hypokinesis with antero-apical akinesis.  Moderate LV margin.  Mild concentric LVH and mild L atrial enlargement (41 mm.).  Dilated aortic loop.  Normal RV size and function.  Mild aortic insufficiency and trace MR.



He is now doing exceedingly well on his current regimen and denies any symptoms of SOB, orthopnea or pedal edema.  He continues to be followed regularly by regularly by Dr. Cook for his ischemic cardiomyopathy/CHF.

coronary artery disease	      

After his admission for CHF, he underwent dolbutamine stress test on 9/30/87, which revealed a small area of ischemia in mid-anterior and a moderate to large-sized area of ischemia inferiorly and there was moderate LV dilatation following stress.  Based on this, he was admitted to MCH and underwent cardiac catheterization.  10/87 he underwent stenting X4 of L circumflex coronary artery and third obtuse marginal branch.  Notably, his cath also revealed a dominant RCA which was occluded proximately and was collateralized from the LAD, which was supplied by the L internal mammary artery.  The L main had no significant lesions.  The LAD had a 50% lesion just before the first diagonal and the mid-LAD was occluded.



He had successful stenting with very good angiographic results and he received adjuvant intravenous [        ] therapy.  He was discharged the following day without complications.  Although his current activity level is somewhat limited by his DJD (see below), he is exercising regularly in the pool and he currently denies any symptoms of angina.

pacemaker	      

S/P DDD pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome 7/83 and doing well.  Continues follow-up with Dr. Whitlock/Cook.

S/P CARDIAC ARREST	      

12/76.  10/76 DEVELOPED EXERTIONAL ANGINA, POSITIVE ETT. CATH AT NEDH REVEALED THREE-VESSEL CAD. AWAITING CABG WHEN 12/76 SUFFERED CARDIAC ARREST. FOUND TO BE IN VT, HAD RECURRENT VT. TRANSFERRED TO MCH AND UNDERWENT CABG AND AICD 2/77.  [04-Nov-2078]



He is doing well S/P ICD implantation in 2/77 with revisions in 7/80 and in 2084.  

hypertension	      

BP is slightly high today, but we will recheck at next visit.  If it remains elevated, would consider increasing Carvedilol

diabetes mellitus	      

He continues on Glyburide and although he checks fasting sugars infrequently, they are typically in the 120's and he denies any symptoms of hypoglycemia.  He has not seen a podiatrist regularly and I have encouraged him to begin this process.  Will check FBS, HBA1C and urine for microalbumin today.

hypercholesterolemia	      

He has had virtual normalization of his lipid profile with Lipitor.  We will check fasting lipids and LFT's today.

nephropathy	      

S/P renal biopsy 10/79 for severe proteinuria which was consistent with diabetic nephropathy. As noted above, a 24-hour urine recently revealed 6gm of protein.  He is on new maximal doses of ACEI's.  [02-Jun-2087]



Recheck BUN and creatinine today.

peripheral vascular disease	      

He has bilateral femoral bruits and diminished peripheral pulses, but because of his limited walking ability, currently has no symptoms of claudication.

RECTAL FISTULA	      

SINCE LAST VISIT HE WAS SEEN BY DR. JENSON AND UNDERWENT A FLEXIBLE. SIG. HE HAD A SINUS OPENING IN THE LEFT POSTERIOR PERIANAL AREA. HE FELT THAT TO FULLY EVALUATE THIS TO SEE WHETHER IT WAS AN ANAL FISTULA OR A PILONIDAL CYST THAT EXAM UNDER ANESTHESIA WITH UNROOFING OF THE LESION WAS INDICATED.  PT SO FAR HAS DECLINED THIS, BUT WILL LET DR. JENSON KNOW IF HE RECONSIDERS.  CURRENTLY HE IS WILLING TO LIVE WITH HIS SYMPTOMS.

OSTEOARTHRITIS	      

He has had recent significant worsening in his L knee pain.  It has now gotten to the point where it limits his ability to walk, so that he can only ""limp less than a block"" and has difficulty with stairs.  Given that he has done well from a cardiac standpoint since his admissions in the spring, he is interested in pursuing a L TKR replacement if Cardiology feels it would be feasible.  Will refer him to Dr. Robles for initial evaluation.

Carotid stenosis	      

According to Dr. Cook's records, a carotid artery duplex scan from 5/06 showed 60 to 80% stenosis of the RICA, but I do not find those records of PCIS.  Apparently he is scheduled for a repeat study before he follows up with Dr. Cook.  He is S/P R cerebellar CVA back in '80 and has had stable minor neurologic deficits since that time and currently denies any new neurologic symptoms.



Review of Systems	

Small lesion on his R ear.  Recent R groin infection which required treatment with antiobiotics by Dr. Valentine in 5/06.  Nocturia X1.  Denies symptoms of hypoglycemia.  No neurologic symptoms.  Denies palpitations, SOB, chest pain, lightheadedness or syncope.  Denies peripheral edema.  No abdominal pain or change in his bowels.  He does have chronic rectal fistula and continues to have intermittent hematochezia and discharge, but he is able to self-treat this and declines surgery.  No melena.

COMPREHENSIVE EXAM. 

PERSONAL DATA AND OVERALL HEALTH:  Now 63, despite his multiple
medical problems, he continues to spend spring in West Virginia and remain
reasonably active.  Wife very helpful in cooking appropriate
meals and helping with day to day issues.  

ONGOING MANAGEMENT/MULTIPLE MEDICAL PROBLEMS:
    1.    Health maintenance.  Eye exam. Continue to recommend annual
    exams with Dr. Ortiz.  Influenza vaccine advised, Winter 89.
    PSA sent.  
    2.    Preventative counseling.  Continues to swim in a pool, no
    alcohol, no cigarettes.  Advised regular skin checks.
    Avoidance of sun.  Rectal exam neg.  Smoking status: none
    smoker.  Stool guaiac test: home with stool guaiac cards.  

PROBLEMS:
    1.    CAD.  He continues to do quite well with no evidence of
    current symptoms of angina.  He is s/p CABG and most
    recently s/p stent distal LCX 10/87.  
    2.    CHF.  He has severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with chronic
    CHF.  His most recent echocardiogram 4/88, showed a severe
    depressed LV systolic function with estimated EF of 30% with
    global hypokinesis and antero-apical akinesis with moderate
    LV enlargement and mild concentric LVH with left atrial
    enlargement, dilated aortic root, mild AI and trace MR. 
    despite this, since getting on a stable dose of Lasix and
    Carvedilol, which was added during his hospitalization for
    CHF in 10/87, he has done well and currently denies symptoms
    of orthopnea, PND or edema.  
    3.    S/P AICD.  He is s/p recent admission to MCH, 6/17 through
    6/19/89 for replacement of his cardiac defibrillator.  He
    did well without complication and he continues to follow up
    Dr. Cook on a regular basis.  He has had no VT, VF, which
    has been symptomatic or which has caused triggering of his
    AICD.  
    4.    S/P DDD pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome, 7/83.  Continues
    to do well, again, with close monitoring by Dr. Cook. 
    5.    Hypertension.  Blood pressure is excellent on current
    regimen and will continue same.  

George, Rickey
MR #113-14-14                 -2-            June 27, 2089

    6.    Diabetes mellitus.  He continues on oral agents, watching
    his diet and exercising as much as he is able.  He does not
    monitor sugars often but he reports when he does have them
    done, sugars are typically fasting 100-150 and no symptoms
    of hypoglycemia.  Will check HBA1C and urine for micro
    albumin today.  
    7.    Cerebral vascular disease.  He is s/p cerebellar CVA, 7/80
    with mild residual dysarthria and right sided weakness but
    has had no new neurologic events. His most recent carotid
    artery duplex study was from 5/88, showed a 60-80% stenosis
    of the RICA but I don't actually hear a bruit on his exam
    today.  He continues on Coumadin anticoagulation.  
    8.    Hypercholesterolemia.  His most recent lipid profile is
    quite improved with Lipitor with a total cholesterol down to
    136, triglycerides 313, HDL 25, LDL 48 on 6/11/89.
    Unfortunately, since his HDL remains low, which is
    suboptimal, but he has not tolerated Niacin in the past. 
    9.    Peripheral vascular disease. He continues to have bilateral
    femoral bruits and diminished peripheral pulses but because
    of his limited walking ability, he currently has no symptoms
    of claudication. 
    10.   Osteoarthritis. He is s/p left TKR by Dr. Robles last year
    and is now doing quite well.  Notably, he would require
    antibiotic prophylaxis for procedures.  

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denies chest pain, shortness of breath,
abdominal pain. He continues to have a rectal fistula.  Last
year, had a negative Barium enema study and several years ago a
sigmoidoscopy because of guaiac positive stool but this is
presumably secondary to the rectal fistula, which intermittently
bleeds.  He has had no recent edema in his legs. His left knee is
doing quite well and he is working to strengthen the thigh
muscles. He has nocturia one time per night. He has stable
impotence, some decreased interest as well as some decreased
ability to have erections, though he can still have a partial
erection. Generalized decreased energy level.  

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure:  136/60, pulse: 60 and regular. 
Weight: 181. General: amazingly well appearing.  Skin: no
suspicious lesions.  HEENT: oropharynx edentulous, no lesions. 
Lungs: clear to A&P.  COR:  carotids 2+, no bruits appreciated by
my exam.  JVP flat. Thyroid: no thyromegaly. Nodes: no
adenopathy.  COR:  s/p median sternotomy scar.  Pacer left upper
chest wall. AICD with fresh Steri strips in place. No evidence

of erythema.  Left upper abdomen.  S1, S2, 2/6, HSM,  apex no S3,
or diastolic murmur appreciated.  Abdomen: positive bowel sounds,
soft non tender, no HSM or masses.  Rectal: mildly diffusely
enlarged prostate without nodules, no rectal masses. Stool brown,
guaiac negative.  Extremities:  scar over the left knee, no
peripheral edema.  

DISPOSITION:  Follow up with Opal Fierro.  Flu shot in the
winter, sooner PRN.

George, Rickey
MR#: 1131414
July 7, 2090 

Reason for visit: Comprehensive annual exam/ongoing management of
multiple chronic medical problems.

Health maintenance. Complete physical examination 7/7/90.  Eye
exam: continues to follow up annually with Dr. Ortiz. 
Influenza vaccine scheduled winter 90.  PSA deferred given age,
cardiac issues.  Podiatry exam: routine.  Rectal: neg. 
Sigmoidoscopy 10/87, divertic's, Dr. Ramsey.  Smoking status: 90
pack/year, approximately 100 pack/year smoking history.  Quit. 
Stool guaiac: home with stool guaiac cards. 

Other problems: 

1.   CAD.  Status post CABG 1/77.  PTCA stent distal LCX 10/87. 
No recent symptoms of angina though he apparently was started on
Imdur during a hospitalization in West Virginia this spring.  

2.   Status post VF arrest.  Status post AICD.  Continues to
follow up with Dr. Cook on a regular basis.  AICD has not
triggered.  

3.   Status post DDD pacer for sic sinus syndrome.  He has
frequent ectopics versus ? AF by exam today.  Will check EKG and
rhythm strip. 

4.   CHF/CMCAD.  He had an episode of shortness of breath leading
to hospitalization this spring down in West Virginia.  Unfortunately, I
do not have records but there was some question of whether this
was related to asthma, allergies or CHF.  He has had two pillow
orthopnea and worsening edema than in the past.  He has also
noted some more exertional dyspnea.  He denies cough, wheeze,
hemoptysis.  ? PND. 

     Most recent echo 4/88, severely depressed LV with EF about
30%.  Mild concentric LVH.  Dilated aortic route.  Mild AI. 
Trace MR.  He is currently on a regimen of Imdur, Lasix,
Carvedilol, Zestril and Digoxin.

     Will plan increase Lasix to 80 q.d. Check chest x-ray, PFTs
and reassess.

5.   Diabetes mellitus.  Continues on oral agents and has been
quite good with his diet.  Weight is actually down 10 pounds
which he attributes to excellent attention to diet.  Will recheck
FBS, HB A1c today.  He continues to receive routine dental and
podiatry care.  

6.   Status post cerebellar CVA.  Mild residual dysarthria and
right sided weakness.  No new neurologic events.  Most recent
carotid study 5/88, 60-80% stenosis right internal carotid.  He
continues on Coumadin.

profile though HDL remains low.  He has not tolerated Niacin in
the past.  Will recheck fasting lipids today.

8.   Peripheral vascular disease.  Continues to have bilateral
femoral bruits but no complaints of claudication.  

9.   Osteoarthritis/left knee pain.  He is status post left TKR
by Dr. Robles last year.  Unfortunately had a knee injury down in
West Virginia this spring and has quite a bit of problem with swelling
and pain.  He was seen by Dr. Robles who treated him briefly with
Vioxx but this caused significant worsening lower extremity edema
and decreased urine output requiring its discontinuation.  He is
now carefully using ibuprofen and has follow up scheduled with
Dr. Robles.

10.  Nephropathy.  Status post renal biopsy 10/79 for severe
proteinuria.  Biopsy consistent with diabetic nephropathy. 
Continues on ACE inhibitor.  Will recheck BUN, creatinine today.

Review of systems: As per HPI, no abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, melena, hematochezia, hematuria.  Otherwise as noted
above.

Physical examination: Weight 175 (down from 181 6/89).  Pulse 64,

George, Rickey
MRN: 1131414
06/10/92

REASON FOR VISIT:  Scheduled follow up of multiple medical problems.

PROBLEMS:
1.   Status post removal of infected AICD and pacer.  Admitted to Massillon Community 12/91 with infection of his AICD and permanent pacer.  He was managed by multiple
services including EP, Cardiology, and ID.  His OR cultures grew candida and he was treated
with a prolonged course of fluconazole.  Although he had runs of NSVT, he was managed
effectively with carvedilol.  Notably his digoxin was stopped because of bradycardia during the
hospitalization. He never had any sustained VT or VF.  He was subsequently discharged home
with a Life vest defibrillator.

He has done well with no recurrent evidence of infection.  He currently has no AICD or
pacemaker but saw Dr. Cook yesterday and apparently he is being evaluated for new hardware
for his arrhythmia issues.  He has a history of both VF arrest and sick sinus syndrome.  Currently
his heart rate is slightly irregular but a reasonable rate and he will continue on his current
regimen as prescribed by Dr. Cook with close follow up.  

2.   CHF.  Immediately after his discharge from CCGH after his hospitalization, he went
directly to West Virginia where his wife was able to care for him. He had one episode of CHF, which
was managed as an outpatient, and he is now on slightly doses of Lasix than previously.  At the
present time, he has no active symptoms of CHF, he continues to sleep on two large pillows at
night without symptoms of orthopnea and has minimal to no peripheral edema.  He does
continue on an ACE inhibitor and potassium along with his Lasix. 

3.   Coronary artery disease.  Despite all of his active issues, he has no current symptoms of
angina and has tolerated his multiple recent procedures well.

4.   Status post infected (staph) left knee arthroplasty.  His left TKR also required removal
due to infection and he had replacement of new hardware by Dr. Judd 10/91.  He has had no
recurrent infection, but his rehabilitation has been more limited because of his other medical
issues.  He does report that he was swimming in the pool and doing things on his own while
down in West Virginia, but we will make a formal rehab referral now that he is back in the Mexico area.

5.   Diabetes mellitus.  Throughout his numerous medical problems over the past six to
twelve months, he has had a significant weight loss and not surprisingly, his diabetes regimen
has been gradually decreased.  He is now on Glyburide 5 mg b.i.d. and he reports that his fasting
sugars which he is checking about three times a week are running quite good in the 100 to 120
range.  He has no complaints of hypoglycemia or blood sugars greater than 200.  We will check
his HbA1c today and continue his current regimen.
George, Rickey
MRN: 1131414
06/10/92

6.   Hyperlipidemia.  He continues on Lipitor.  We'll recheck his fasting lipids, LFTs and
CPK.

7.   Diabetic nephropathy.  He remains on ACE inhibitor and will check renal function today
to re-establish baseline.

8.   Status post CVA.  Known moderate right carotid stenosis.  Minimal residual dysarthria
and right-sided weakness. Has had no recent neurologic symptoms and remains on Coumadin.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure by palpation 130.  Was unable to get sufficient blood
pressure by cuff.  Pulse 60, mostly irregular. General, thin, but no distress.  Lungs, clear to
auscultation and percussion.  Cor, distant heart sounds.  No S3 appreciated. Old pacer/AICD site. 
No evidence of erythema or fluctuance.  Extremities, trace edema bilaterally.

DISPOSITION:  Close ongoing follow up.

ADDENDUM:  In reviewing patient's medical records after he left today, I found mention of
both hematuria and guaiac positive stool during his recent hospitalizations.  At this time, he was
quite debilitated and I do not think it would be a good time for colonoscopy.  He did deny
abdominal symptoms as part of my review of systems today.  

At this point, my plan will be to send him some stool guaiac cards which he can do at home and
send in to me by mail.  I have also sent off a CBC today.  I will plan to repeat urinalysis at his
next visit.  If he has persistent hematuria or guaiac positive stool, then we will need to discuss
more aggressive work-up, but given his overall health condition, I do not feel the need to be
aggressive at this time and would like to see him get some strength back first.

  Rickey George
  MR#1131414
  October 05, 2092
  
  Reason for visit: scheduled follow up status post MCH hospitalization.  
  
  PROBLEMS:
  
  PVD: since last visit he was admitted to MCH with gangrene in his left second toe. 
  Admitted MCH 8/29 through 9/9/92.  Treated by Dr. Randall.  Underwent extensive
  revascularization including right common and external artery transluminal balloon
  angioplasty and stenting, bilateral common and profunda femoral artery
  endarterectomies, right and left femoral to femoral bypass graft, left femoral to above
  knee popliteal bypass graft.  With this surgery, only his left second toe remained
  gangrenous and he was able to avoid BKA.  
  
  He will likely either auto-amputate or will require amputation of his left second toe
  which remains gangrenous but he has reasonable perfusion to the remainder of his left
  foot and has follow up scheduled next week with Dr. Randall.  
  
  Renal insufficiency: during his hospitalization he bumped his creatinine quite a bit but
  this appeared to be due to acute interstitial nephritis caused by Unasyn (positive urine
  EO's), reached a high of 3.9 on 9/02 but was down to 1.4 which is baseline at the time of
  hospital discharge 9/9.  Will recheck renal function today.  
  
  Diabetes mellitus: his appetite has been poor and he had blood sugars, which were low on
  oral agents, and these have been discontinued.  His blood sugars are now in the normal
  range on no oral agents or insulin.  Will need to monitor closely through rehab.  
  
  CHF: he had been on 80 b.i.d. of Lasix prior to his hospitalization.  At the time of
  hospital discharge his dose was down to 40 b.i.d. and not surprisingly he developed quite
  a bit of recurrent peripheral edema.  He called the office and I increased his Lasix back
  up to 60 b.i.d. but he still has significant edema.  Will go back to 80 b.i.d. with close
  monitoring.  
  
  Hypertension: with diuresis and weight loss, his BP is running low.  Will hold lisinopril
  for now.  Close VNA follow up.  
  
  COPD: doing well despite recent surgery.  Continues to use Combivent inhaler p.r.n.  
  
  Anemia: Crit was in the 20's during his hospitalization in the setting of acute renal failure
  and surgery with blood loss.  His Crit at the time of discharge was approximately 28.7
  and he was being started on Epogen.  Unfortunately because of insurance issues, he has
  not actually been able to yet obtain it but the plan is for him to get 2,000 units 3 times a

  week.  For now, he is on vitamins and iron supplements as his bowels tolerate.  Given his
  history of CAD, goal is to keep his hematocrit between 30-32.  
  
  Coronary artery disease: despite his recent surgical stress and anemia, he has had no
  anginal symptoms.  
  
  Review of systems: constipation related to the iron.  Generally weak.  Home services
  now include VNA, home health aide, PTOT, walking with a walker, biggest issue is
  mostly depression in the setting of his failing health.  
  
  Social history: wife very involved with his care.  
  
  Physical exam: BP 98/60.  Pulse 64.  Lungs clear to A & P.  Cor: SEMACIAN gallop. 
  No rub.  Abdomen: mildly distended, nontender.  Multiple well healed surgical scars. 
  Extremities: incisions in the groin.  No erythema.  Right groin several cm question cystic
  structure beneath the incision.  Soft, nontender, non-erythematous.  2-3+ edema in the
  extremities bilaterally.  Dry gangrene left second toe.  
  
  Disposition: 1. Increase Lasix to 80 b.i.d. phone follow up within several days.  
  2. Temporarily hold lisinopril given low BP.  
  3. Continue Percocet for toe pain.  
  4. Follow up with Dr. Randall who needs to assess the cystic mass in his right groin.  
  5. Will continue to work with insurance to try to obtain Epogen.  In the meantime, will
  transfuse if Crit drops below 28.  
  6. Add Lexapro 10mg 1 p.o. q.d. 
  
  Addendum: long discussion with the patient and his wife (his healthcare proxy) today
  about end of life issues.  Specifically he states he would never consider any amputation
  other than his single toe at this point.  He would specifically ""rather die"" than undergo a
  BKA.  He also states he wishes to be DNR and would not consider intubation even under
  the circumstances of acute CHF or pneumonia.

Please see admit note for details of patients presentation. 

Briefly, Pt is a 59 yo man with the following CV risk factors: smoker, HTN who presents with L sided chest pain and found to have inf STEMI no w s/p baremetal stent x 3 placement awaiting repeat catherization for L Circ PCI.

CCU course by problem:

Cardiac Ischemia     Pt presented with L sided Chest pain, EKG showed 2-3 mm STE in I, aVL and STD in V4-6.  Cardiac catherization showed tight LCx lesion (no intervention), distal RCA thrombotic lesion with 2 distal PLV that were ballooned and 3 bare metal stents:  1 in distal RCA distal (vision 3.5 x15) and prox and distal PLV (minivision).  Post cath he was chest pain free with resolution of his STE.  At cath, he was loaded with plavix at cath and received integrillin.  Post procedure he was B blocked with lopressor (HR in 50   s), given ASA, plavix, and lipitor 80, and started on captopril.   Presently, plan (per cardiology) is for repeat cath for PCI of L circ.   LDL was 84, on 80 mg QD lipitor.  Pt expressed desire to quit smoking     smoking cessation consult pending.

Cardiac Pump     Echo done on 11/08 showed an EF of 54% with no RV or LV dysfunction, no WMA and no valvular abnormalities.  Pt did not demonstrate evidence of volume overload.     he was hemodynamically stable.

	Reason for visit:
   Follow up visit visit


	Interval History:
   60 year old man with Coronary artery disease who presented in November 2134 with substernal chest pressure and evidence of inferior ST-segment elevation.  Known risk factors at that time (in addition to his age and gender) were Hypertension and tobacco smoking.  Details of that presentation as per my 12/16/34 office note.

Emergent catheterization showed three areas of severe stenosis in the RCA territory, one in the ditsal RCA and two in the PLV.  The PLV lesions each received 2.5 x15mm Minivision (bare metal stents) and the distal RCA lesion received a 3.5 x15mm Vision (bare metal stent).  A non-dominant Left Circumflex had a 70% stenosis that was not intervened upon.  There was non-obstructive disease in the LAD.

A transthoracic echo showed an LV EF of 54% and no wall motion abnormalities.  Left atrium was slightly dilated to 39mm.  RV function was normal.

He recovered well and was discharged on an appropriate medical program (see below).  He had an outpatient ETT-MIBI to further evaluate the significance of the residual LCx disease.  He had this on 12/07/34 and he exercised for 6 minutes, 7 METS and achieved a heart rate 70% of predicted. He did not experience chest pain, had an appropriate increase in systolic blood pressure and the study was terminated due to leg fatigue.  The images showed inferior and apical thinning without ischemia.  LV EF 63%.

He had a recurrent episode of chest pain (somewhat different than his MI as it was not pressure like) and presented to the ED in March.  His ECG was stable and biomarkers were negative and he had a repeat ETT-MIBI in which he exercised for 7 mins 10 sec, achieving 9 METS, 80% MPHR, peak double product 19K.  A different type of chest pain occurrred during the study and was not study-limiting.  The ECG was negative for ischemia and the perfusion images were normal, without evidence of ischemia or infarction.  LV EF 68%.

He has overall done well since the time of his STEMI.  He completed part of the program at cardiac rehab.  He quit cigarette smoking at the time of the MI, and has remained abstinent since then.  He resumed normal activities without limiting symptoms in terms of chest pain or shortness of breath. His overall activity is at times limited due to ankylosing spondylitis and associated pain.

Three days ago he reports the onset of chest pain.  This occurs in his left chest and lasts hours at a time.  Not related to exertion and he has not tried SL TNG.  He states that he has been carrying heavy holiday packages and did some light outdoor work, and wonders if the pain may have been caused by those activities (i.e. muscolskeletal in nature).  He has 2 flights of stairs at home and is able to climb them with minimal shortness of breath, which has not changed since the onset of the CP.  He is unsure how the character relates to that of his previous MI, and he thinks it is similar to the discomfort he had in March that prompted his ED visit and negative stress test.  He denies lightheadedness or syncope.  No orthopnea or lower extremity swelling.

He continues to be compliant with his medical regimen.  He had a past sleep study which indicates the presence of sleep disordered breathing and he states he is in the process of acquiring home CPAP therapy.  He does report weight gain since stopping cigarettes.


	Past medical history:
   1) CAD status post inferior STEMI 11/34 with 3 bare metal stents to RCA territory (1 in distal RCA and two in the PLV).  Known residual LCx 70% lesion in a small, non-dominant vessel
2) Hypertension
3) Hyperlipideimia
4) Former smoker - quit at the time of his MI
5) Ankylosing spondylitis
6) Thrombophlebitis of the left leg, report of DVT in other notes

lisinopril  10 mg po daily
Niaspan 
Plavix  75mg po daily
Toprol XL  25 mg PO daily

Physical examination:
	
-Pulse: 50  regular
-weight: 268  lbs.
-General:   Looks well, overweight, pleasant 
-HEENT:   Jugular venous pressure 7cm, carotids 2+ bilaterally without bruits
-Chest:   CTAB
-Cardiac:   Point of maximal impulse is midclavicular; Distant, regular, S1 and S2, no murmurs or rubs
-Abdomen:   Soft, obese, non-tender
-Extremities:   No lower extremity edema, 2+ posterior tibial pulses bilaterally
-BP: 130/75  both arms


	EKG:
   Baseline artifact, Sinus bradycardia at 50 bpm, clockwise rotation, minor nonspecific T wave changes; compared to 16-June-2135, the heart rate is slightly decreased, otherwise no important change.


	Assessment and plan:
   60 year old man with CAD status post inferior STEMI 11/34 treated with 3 bare metal stents to the RCA territory, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, and Ankylosing spondylitis who is overall doing well with secondary prevention efforts for his coronary disease, although he does report a chest pain syndrome for the past several days.

1) Coronary artery disease: Bare metal stents only are in place in the RCA territory, and he has now completed over a 12 month course of Plavix therapy.  Given that the main treatment plan at this time for his ankylosing spondylitis is NSAIDs (i.e. Motrin), he will stop Plavix to help minimize the bleeding risk and since there is no absolute indication for him to continue it at this point. 

He will continue the medical regimen of ASA 81mg daily, Lipitor 20mg daily, Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily.  His heart rate and blood pressure are well controlled.

The chest pain syndrome that he has been having for the past several days is reassuring in the sense that it is not exertion related and it seems similar to March when he had an ETT-MIBI without ischemia on perfusion images.  He does have a known 70% stenosis in a non-dominant LCx, but two imaging studies have not shown ischemia in that territory.  His ECG today is unchanged from priors.  However, given his history we will be vigilant for any change or persistence in symptoms.  I will call the patient in several days time, and if he continues to have symptoms he can have a repeat ETT.

2) Secondary prevention: Most recent Lipid panel in 10/35 on Lipitor 20mg daily shows TC 126, LDL 62, HDL 25 and TGs 195.  His LDL has been well controlled however his HDL has been very low on several readings.  Given this, along with an elevated TG value, we will start Niaspan.  He can start with 500 mg qhs for the first 2-3 weeks to help get through the common adverse effects (i.e. flushing).  He should take the medication with a glass of cold water and may take his daily aspirin 30 minutes before to help minimize side effects.  After a few weeks, he can increase to the maintenance dose of 1000 mg qhs.

He has quit smoking completely since the time of the MI and plans to continue this forward. He was encouraged to increase his physical activity level.

3) Hypertension: Reasonably well controlled on Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily.  He will be starting CPAP for sleep apnea soon which may have a favorable effect on his blood pressure.

   Cardiology Admit Note


	Interval History:
   Primary cardiologist: Jan Ivory (Kevin Mcdaniel)

61 y/o M with h/o CAD admitted for CP.

Cardiovascular history notable for:
- Nov 34 - acute IMI; cath (11/08/34) LM, LAD and large Ramus with minimal disease, LCx with tandem 70% and 50% stenosis in non-dominant vessel, distal RCA with 90% stenosis and mid and distal PLV with tandem 80% lesions; Rx: Vision 2.5 x 15 to distal RCA, Minivision x 2 (2.5 x 15 each) to mid and distal PLV
- echo (11/08/34) EF 54%, overall unremarkable
- last ETT-MIBI (2/23/35) 7:10, 9 METs, 80% mphr, pkdp 19k, developed chest pain (different from presenting) at 7 mins, ECG negative to HR attained, images without ischemia or infarction, EF 68%

He has done quite well from a cardiac perspective since the MI.  He has occasional fleeting chest pain but never sustained and nothing in the past 1-2 months.

He awoke this AM with dull left chest pain which has persisted throughout the day.  Pain was 6/10 at worst, unchanged with exertion and similar in quality (albeit less intense) to pain during STEMI.  No associated SOB, nausea, diaphoresis or radiation.  Given the CP persistance, he presented to the ER.  Initial ECGs showed sinus brady with a relatively normal tracing; no acute ischemic changes and no significant change from prior.  After a combination of 4 SL nitro, IV nitro, IV heparin and morphine (2mg IV x 2), the CP eventually subsided.  

Currently, he is CP free and resting comfortably.  At baseline, he doesn't exercise formally but he has 3 flights of stairs at home and he's able to climb them without exertional symptoms.  Also, he was previously on therapy for GERD but stopped taking prilosec several months ago.    


	Past medical history:
   - CAD - as above
- HTN
- hyperlipidemia

	Assessment and plan:
   61 y/o M with h/o CAD p/w CP.  Some features are concerning for angina (similar to prior symptoms, some improvement with nitro...), whereas other aspects are less concerning (prolonged CP without ECG changes or biomarker leak).  Overall, doubt ACS.

In terms of subtle LLL opacity on CXR, doubt PNA given lack of cough, sputum or  fever...He has mild leukocytosis (normal differential) of unclear etiology.

Plan:
- cycle troponins
- continue IV heparin overnight
- if biomarkers negative and no recurrent CP, would favor ETT-MIBI in AM for further risk stratification
- continue home meds
- hold metformin, in case cath required
- repeat CBC with diff in AM, check U/A

Follow Up - post hospitalization visit



He was admitted 2/01-2/03/74 for NSTEMI.  On 1/31 he had symptoms similar to those he experienced prior to his MI in 2073: pain in back of left neck, left shoulder, and left arm.  As a result he did not exercise that day.  The symptoms improved spontaneously.  On 2/01 he did his normal exercise routine, running on the treadmill for 40 minutes; he felt fine.  Later that day, he had recurrence of the symptoms so he called Dr. Ishmael's answering service.  Dr. Patterson was covering and recommended he go to ED.  He is very impressed that Dr. Patterson saw him that evening in the ED.  There EKG showed no changes but troponin-I and CK screen were positive.  He was admitted to cardiology service and managed with integrullin and heparin.  When second set of enzymes was positive on 2/02 he went to cath lab, where old RCA stent was ""pristine,"" LAD showed stable 50% lesion, but distal LCx showed 90% lesion.  He had PTCA and stenting with medicated stent, producing excellent result.  He was discharged on 2/03 on plavix.



Today, he says he has had no recurrence of symptoms.  He is feeling great.  He is concerned that he had the MI despite taking all his medications as prescribed and feeling so well with exercise.  He wonders whether he needs to re-start cardiac rehab.  He is avoiding exercise until he sees Dr. Ishmael next week.  He has had no groin hematoma or other complications.

Episodic Visit



He has had a cold for 5 days and wanted to get checked.  He says it started Saturday with a tickle in his throat; he went to the race track on Sunday and felt the same; on Tuesday he had dry cough, occasionally bringing up clear sputum.  He had no fevers but perhaps some mild sweats.  He notes mild sinus congestion and post-nasal drip.  No known sick contacts.  He got a flu shot at the TFMC in 11/74 and pneumovax at last appt in 11/74.  He is feeling mostly better, and was able to work out on the treadmill for 1.5 miles without difficulty.  He has had no chest pain or dyspnea.  He is using Robitussin DM, but askes if there is anything better for him to use.

MAMARONECK INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Orta, Phil
                                              55931516
                                              8-02-73
 
                                              
                                              
HPI:  Mr. Orta is a 50-year-old African-American man who has been 
treated for the five past years by LBH at Edgefield.  He was seen in MHC 
clinic prior to that.  His LBH physician was Dr. Jaeger and his phone 
number is 872-9985.  Patient was last seen one year ago due to the fact 
that he lost his job and his insurance with LBH and states that he has 
not seen a physician in the past year.
 
His medical problems include:
1.   Coronary artery disease with angioplasty in 2063.  It is unclear 
     which vessels were plastied.  
2.   Hypercholesterolemia treated in the past with gemfibrozil and niacin 
     for coexistent hypertriglyceridemia.  However, he has not taken any 
     niacin or gemfibrozil for the past year as well. 
3.   Anxiety.
4.   Condyloma last fall.
 
Medications:  1) enteric coated aspirin 325mg q.d.; 2) lorazepam 1mg PO 
q.h.s. prescribed by Dr. Guadalupe Thacker at LBH.  Patient also had 
nitroglycerin tablets at home.  Patient used to use diltiazem 30mg PO 
t.i.d.; however, that was stopped a year ago when he lost his insurance.  
He does not have any history of hypertension in the past.
 
Social history:  He is currently not working.  He has been unemployed for 
a month and a half.  He used to be a social worker which did not 
involve any heavy lifting.  He did community services managment.  He 
lives with his mother and his sister and has never been married.  
 
Review of systems:  Patient states that he has very infrequent episodes of 
chest pains over the last 10 years.  However, he does say that his last 
chest pain was approximately a week and a half ago.  When asked where the 
pain was he put his hand over this mid-epigastrium and stated that the 
pain was very similar to the pain he used to have prior to his 
angioplasty.  He took two sublingual nitroglycerins and the pain was 
relieved within a few minutes of the second nitroglycerin tablet.  At the 
time he was just sitting on his couch watching television.  He has no 
history of exertional angina over the last several years.  However, this 
complaint of chest pain at rest is very worrisome for unstable angina.  He 
currently does not complain of any shortness of breath, dyspnea on 
exertion, palpitation, or pre-syncope.
 
On physical examination Mr. Orta is a middle-aged black male in no 
apparent distress.  Temperature was afebrile.  Heart rate was 68 and 
regular.  Blood pressure was 126/92 in the right arm in a sitting 
position.  HEENT was within normal limits.  Lungs were clear bilaterally.  
Heart exam was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  
Abdomen was benign.  Extremities were without edema or lesions.

Assessment and Plan:
 
1.   Cardiovascular.  Patient clearly has coronary artery disease given 
     his past history of angioplasty and his recent complaint of chest 
     pain at rest is worrisome for unstable angina.  Given that he is on 
     no current cardiac medication except for aspirin, I will decide to 
     initiate therapy with diltiazem CD 120mg PO q.d. in an attempt to 
     control his blood pressure and heart rate.  I also encouraged him to 
     continue his aspirin daily and gave him a fresh bottle of 
     nitroglycerin tablets for use with any chest pain in the near future.  
     The plan will be to get the patient on stable dose of diltiazem and 
     maximize the dose for his heart and blood pressure control.  After he 
     has been on a stable dose for several days, we will perform an 
     outpatient stress test to evaluate whether the patient has any 
     evidence of ischemia at this time.  If he does, we will recommend a 
     cardiac catheterization to treat any potential lesions which may be 
     causing syms of rest angina.  The case was discussed with any 
     cardiacs that are on call.
 
2.   Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease I sent an 
     SMA-20 level off to assess for hypercholesterolemia which he does 
     have with a cholesterol of 291 and hypertriglyceridemia which he also 
     has at a level of 336.  He has been taking gemfibrozil and niacin in 
     the past; however, he has not been taking it for the last year.  I 
     instructed him to decrease the amount of cholesterol and fats in his 
     diet and explained which food contain those products.  I will also 
     initiate treatment with a HMG CoA inhibitor which should decrease 
     both his cholesterol as well as the triglycerides.  We will start him 
     off on simvastatin 20mg PO q.d. later this week.
 
3.   Daily anxiety.  Will continue the patient's Ativan in an attempt to 
     control his daily anxiety which he says is well controlled without 
     Ativan.
 
4.   History of condyloma in his genital area from last year.  Patient 
     states that he currently has several lesions which we will examine on 
     his next visit.  If he does, we will refer him to dermatology for 
     liquid nitrogen treatment to remove the lesions.

     status post losing his job and LBH insurance last year.  The 
     patient's home phone number is 534-3442.

I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Christopher Parrish, in follow up today.  He is a 71-year-old, right-handed man who was admitted to the Sutton Family Care on December 29, 2088 with left arm weakness, ataxia and dysarthria.  The impression at that time was for lacunar stroke.  An MRI showed a larger area of infarct in the right corona radiata.  The patient had worsening weakness on the night of admission, despite being heparinized.  The following day, he had a flaccid hemiparesis of the left side.  Further workup included a magnetic resonance angiogram that showed irregularity of the proximal middle cerebral arteries bilaterally.  There was no critical carotid stenosis.  He had an embolic workup which consisted of an echocardiogram showing a preserved ejection fraction, dilated left atrium, very mild inferior hypokinesis, and no patent foramen ovale.  He had a Holter monitor which did not reveal any dysrhythmias.  His cholesterol level was 152 with an HDL of 23.  It was felt that his stroke was most likely due to atherosclerosis of the middle cerebral artery, involving either one or possibly several lenticulostriate arteries.  He did not have any evidence of a flow limiting MCA stenosis.  He had been on aspirin prior, Plavix was added to his regimen.   


Since his discharge from the hospital, he has been in rehabilitation for the last two months.  He has had no further episodes of weakness, numbness, tingling, ataxia, dysarthria, or dysphagia.  He has no symptoms of aphasia.  He has been left with some dysarthria from his initial event, which he feels has improved.  I would agree with him.  He also has regained some strength in the left leg, and is currently working on using a walker with assistance.  Unfortunately, he has not regained any use of the left arm.  He has not had any problems with spasms.   


His past medical history is significant for hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus.  He had an inferior myocardial infarction in 2060.  He had a quadruple bypass in 2083.  His last stress test in 2087 showed moderate inferolateral ischemia in the region of a prior myocardial infarct.  He has pulmonary disease due to asbestosis.  He has chronic renal failure and neuropathy secondary to his diabetes.  He has also had laser surgery for diabetic retinopathy.  
 
His medications currently include clonidine .1 mg. p.o. b.i.d., Plavix 75 mg. p.o. q.d., aspirin 325 mg. p.o. q.d., Neurontin 300 mg. p.o. q.h.s., Gemfibrozil 600 mg. p.o. b.i.d., Isordil and Lasix.  He had been on Captopril earlier, but he has since been taken off that medicine.  He was managed with insulin during his prior admission.  I assume he is still on this medicine, although he did not specifically state so.  He has an allergy to sulfa drugs.  
 
The patient lives with a friend who works at Marble Slab Creamery.  The patient quit smoking 15 years ago and only rarely drinks alcohol on social occasions.  There is a history of coronary artery disease in his father and at least one of his brothers, but no family history of stroke.  
 
On examination, he was a pleasant gentleman in no apparent distress.  His blood pressure was 150/90.  His language was intact.  His speech was somewhat dysarthric, although this was improved from his admission.  He was alert and oriented.  His conversation was appropriate.  The visual fields were full.  The pupils were equal and reactive at 4 mm.  Facial sensation was normal.  There was an upper motor neuron left facial droop.  The tongue and palate were midline.  The patient had 0/5 flaccid hemiplegia of the left arm.  There was atrophy of the left biceps.  There was full range of motion of the joints.  The patient had 2/5 left iliopsoas, 4+/5 hip extensors, 3/5 left quadriceps, 3/5 left ankle dorsiflexors, and 3/5 ankle plantar flexors.  The tone in the lower extremities was not increased.  His right side was 5/5.  He had hyperreflexia of the left side and an equivocal toe.  His right toe was downgoing.  Sensation was intact to light touch and pinprick.  I could not find any evidence to pinprick of his neuropathy.  Vibration sense was very mildly reduced at the toes.  He was in a wheelchair, and his gait was not assessed.  
 
Mr. Parrish's recovery is progressing.  He has regained some strength in his left leg and his goal is to be able to walk on his own with either a cane or walker.  I hope that this will be the case.  Unfortunately, his left arm has remained flaccid and he has no movement.  I told him that his left arm will most likely remain with severe weakness.  His stroke was most likely related to atheroma of the middle cerebral artery and lenticulostriate arteries.  I would encourage his blood pressure to be controlled, as has been done, and to continue an anticholesterol agent.  I believe he has been on Gemfibrozil for a while.  The literature suggests benefit for the statin drugs in primary prevention of stroke in patients with elevated cholesterol.  I do not think that gemfibrozil has been studied in the same way.  However, since he has been on this medicine so long, it may be worthwhile to continue using it if it is controlling his total cholesterol well.  He should continue on an aspirin a day.  He states that he is having difficulty obtaining Plavix due to the cost.  I recommended to him that, in the experience of the Stroke Service at Sutton Family Care, patients in his situation do benefit from being on Plavix for a period of time after a stroke of this type.  We recommended to him that he continue on Plavix for another six months because of this.   This should give adequate time for any ulcerated or unstable plaque in his middle cerebral artery to heal.  After six months, if he has had no further clinical events, it would be reasonable to assume that his atheroma is stable and that he could be adequately treated with aspirin.  I will see him again in clinic in approximately six months.  I will arrange for carotid noninvasives and anterior transcranial Dopplers to evaluate his carotid and middle cerebral artery in approximately one year's time.  
 
The patient was seen and examined by Dr. Laith Greene of the Sutton Family Care Stroke Service, who was present for all relevant portions of the history and physical examination.  
 
Sincerely,

He has rhonchi in right lower lobe.

a/p bronchitis vs pna in former smoker w/ COPD. will obtain CXR. 

rx w/ levoflox and rob AC (sugar free)



Diabetes mellitus: His blood sugar has been well controlled. He states that his glucose is usually between 100 and at most 150. He does have microalbuminuria and renal insufficiency and neuropathy. He does have peripheral vascular disease and coronary artery disease as well as diabetes mellitus. We will need to check hemoglobin A1c to determine the level of control. Last hemoglobin A1c was June 2093, and it was 6.8. Continue current management of diabetes mellitus with insulin. Continue to treat and monitor blood pressure. Patient is intolerant of ACE inhibitor due to renal dysfunction. 



Renal dysfunction: He has seen Dr. Krause from Renal associates. He does have bilateral renal artery stenosis. He has also seen Dr. Locklear for consideration of intervention for renal artery stenosis. Patient cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor. Will plan to monitor blood pressure and avoid hyper and hypotension. He will have imaging today.  



Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: The patient has obstructive lung disease. Is currently not short of breath at rest. Only short of breath with activity. Currently using Advair, and Combivent. He also uses Atrovent or albuterol nebulizers as needed. Lungs are without wheezes today. There are fine expiratory rhonchi. Assessment is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Plan will be to continue current management. 



Coronary artery disease: Has no signs or symptoms of cardiac insufficiency or chest wall pain. Continue to treat with nitrates and modify secondary risk factors. 



Hypertension: Blood pressure today is 128/72 with a pulse of 76. Will continue current management. 



Gout: The patient had an episode of gout on his right wrist 2 weeks ago while in New Jersey. Currently taking colchicine with resolution of symptoms. 



Neuropathy: He has neuropathy of the lower extremities in a stocking-glove distribution. Currently taking Neurontin. 



CVA: He is status post stroke with left hemiplegia. He is wheelchair mobile. Currently without new signs or symptoms of neurologic deficits. Will plan to continue to modify secondary risk factors. 



Shortness of breath: Patient states he has some exertional shortness of breath. He is not short of breath at rest. There is no PND, or orthopnea. There is no edema. Examination of the lungs do not revealing any rales. Assessment is shortness of breath which is likely related bronchitis. 

 He has multiple reasons (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease)  and deconditioning and that can account for his baseline shortness of breath. 



Health care maintenance: The patient received a flu shot this year. 



FAMILY HISTORY: No changes relevant to current exam. 



SOCIAL HISTORY: Is not smoking. Not drinking alcohol. He lives in New Jersey and is living at times in the Clifton Forge area.

Mr Gallegos is here in clinic for follow-up of his recent hospitalization for chest pain.  He was seen in clinic on 11/18 and sent to emergency unit due to unstable angina and ECG changes.  He had a cardiac catheterization which showed inferior lateral reversible defect.  He had two stents to the RCA.  He had a right groin stick.  He has a right groin pressure dressing and  the area is slightly tender. He has no lower extremity symptoms. His medications were changed to Plavix, Toprol-XL, lisinopril, aspirin, simvastatin.  
Patient is now currently off his diabetes medications including insulin.  His recent hemoglobin A1c was 6% down from 16%.  He continues to follow a diabetic diet.  His blood sugars are less than 150.  He has no other complaints.  His medical record was reviewed in detail.


Exam:
Vital Signs
BP 123/70, Wt 213 lb

3.  Hepatitis C: Have checked CBC, platelets on Plavix and aspirin.  LFTs on higher dose of simvastatin.  Ultrasound scheduled for next month.
Follow-up with PCP as planned.","Record date: 2070-03-11

Reason for Visit Followup History of Present Illness S/p Cath with stents, no pain since per pt, but wife says he does have pain sometimes which is relieved by resting.  He denies any significant pain and denies any associated sx.  He attributes the sensation to anxiety. He has a stress test next week.  Dicsused potential hazards of ignoring pain, which could be a sign of blockage in one of the stents.  
 
Trying hard to change lifestyle though wife reports little physical activity.  Diet not as good as it was prior.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

56 yo M h/o CAD s/p BMS x2 to RCA, HTN, HLD, diet-controlled DM, smoking, p/w chest pain at rest



#) Chest Pain: Certain aspects of the history (similar to previous e/o angina, sudden onset, relief with NTG) are concerning for cardiac cause. The subtle but real changes in the ECG and the non-zero troponin are also concerning. Other etiologies include anxiety (pt described a sense of doom), pulmonary causes (less likely given nl exam and lack of hypoxia), musculoskeletal (pt denies trauma), PE (pt is not tachycardic or hypoxemic).

-Telemetry

-f/u repeat troponin, CK-MB

-If positive will start heparin gtt

-If negative will continue to cycle enzymes

-Treadmill stress w/imaging in AM

-Continue ASA 325mg, Plavix

-f/u LFTs given CK elevation but continue home statin (no increase in dose given c/f statin myopathy)



#) Thrombocytopenia: appears to be longstanding and stable by labs. The most likely etiology is HCV given the strong association of HCV with thrombocytopenia and his longstanding disease. Other possibilities include Plavix effect (although thrombocytopenia predates starting plavix), alcohol (although pt claims abstinence), or ITP. Hypoproductive etiologies are less likely given nl WBC and Hct. 

-f/u smear

-monitor CBC



#) HTN: Well controlled on arrival

-Continue Lisinopril 5mg PO daily, Propanolol 80mg PO BID (given bradycardia may need to decrease dose although currently tolerating well)



#) HLD: Given CK elevation will defer acutely increasing statin dose

-6/70 lipids LDL 45, HDL 35, TG 123

-Simvastatin 40mg PO qPM



#) DM: most recent A1c 6.7

-FSBG AC+HS

-RISS AC



#) HBV: given h/o HBVcAB pos with HBVsAg neg and HBVsAb neg likely either  chronic seropositive occult HBV with extremely low-level viremia not triggering surface antibody response, or resolved acute HBV having lost high antibody titers over time.

-s/p HBV vaccine x4 doses, most recently 7/70

-f/u repeat HBVsAb repeat to assess response to vaccine

-f/u HBV DNA to eval for occult chronic infection



#) HCV: s/p PEG IFN and Ribavirin 3/65-9/65 with inadequate tx response

-Up to date on HCC screening (AFP and ultrasound within last year)



#) Addiction: abstinent from etoh and IVD &gt;5yrs

-Urine tox

-Encouraged pt to continue to attend AA/NA meetings

-Nicotine patch, consult tobacco cessation

-Will call methadone clinic in AM: Physicians Hospital, 65 Champagne Drive, Freeport, WY 94152 587-033-5624

-Verify methadone dose and let them know pt in hospital

-Continue methadone while in house



#) Bipolar: continue risperdal and neurontin

-f/u with PCP vs. psych to check doses (chart lists risperdal as 1mg PO BID vs. 2mg PO QHS) and Neurontin as 800mg PO BID vs. 600mg PO QID)



#) F/E/N: NPO for stress; D5 &#189; NS while NPO; replete lytes prn K&gt;4, Mg&gt;2

#) Ppx: DVT-ASA/Plavix, hold fragmin given pending heparin gtt decision ; GI-not indicated ; Bowel-colace/senna/dulculax

CCU JAR Admission Note



Name: Urban, Russell

MRN:  4722064

Date of Admission:  7/09/93

PCP:   Georgia

Cards: ward



ID:  50 y/o man transferred to CCU for wide complex tachyarrhythmia 



HPI:  50 y/o man with no PMH and cardiac risk factors of smoking and family history (father died of MI at age 41) who presented to the ED with chest pain. He had an ETT per patient report in Georgia which was neg for ischemia 4 years ago.  He claims excellent exercise tolerance can run at least 3 miles without SOB or CP but does not exercise regularly.   At concert on day of admission, he was sitting at rest when he had sudden onset of crushing sub-sternal chest pain, 8/10, no radiation, associated with mild SOB and marked diaphoresis.  Pt reported some associated back pain with onset, like ""I was being crushed like a sandwich.""  Was not eating at time, not like heartburn, no fevers, chills, cough, or chest trauma.  EMT was called-2 SL ntg relieved pain, was given ASA. 



On arrival to the ED, he was chest pain free.  His HR was 52-60 in normal sinus rhythm.  On hindsight, EKG showed sinus bradycardia with 1mm STE in III,    mm aVF, 1mm STD in I, ? aVL with biphasic T in I, TWI in aVL.  He received ASA and SLTNG

Cardiac RF include tobacco (1/2 ppd x 30 yrs) and early family hx (Dad died of MI, first MI at 41).  No known HTN, DM, or hyperlipidemia.  



Course on floor:



Seen for initial H&P when patient came to CCU5.  During exam, patient became acutely diaphoretic, appeared uncomfortable, still complaining of CP with some mild back pain.  

BP:  L arm 105/66, R arm 90/63. (2 rpt BPs were equal on both arms within 5 mm Hg) HR bradycardia in high 40s, sat 98% 2L.  Tele demonstrated sinus brady, then several runs of 40-50bt wide QRS tachyarrythmia which spontaneously resolved back to sinus bradycardia. Pt was symptomatic during these episodes and appeared acutely SOB, diaphoretic.  Nursing supervisor and medical senior stat paged, 12 ld EKG repeated, pt was given 2 mg IV magnesium and 100mg of lidocaine, started on nonbreather. Heparin was ordered and pt was transferred to the CCU.  



On arrival to CCU, pt was lethargic and diaphoretic.  He denied chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea.



SDU Course:

For ventricular ectopy (likely AIVR in setting of ischemia), pt was transitioned to Amiodarone.  This was tapered off and he had no further ectopy.

 

Echo was performed 7/10:

MITRAL VALVE

There is no evidence of mitral valve prolapse.  There is trace mitral

regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler.



LEFT ATRIUM

There is no evidence of left atrial dilatation.



AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT

There is no evidence of valvular aortic stenosis.  The aortic valve is

tricuspid.  There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or spectral

Doppler.



LEFT VENTRICLE

The left ventricular cavity size is normal.  The left ventricular systolic

function is impaired.  The left ventricle is diffusely hypokinetic with

regional variation. The Inferior wall is akinetic.  The estimated ejection

fraction is 28 %.



TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC

There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of trace tricuspid insufficiency.



RIGHT VENTRICLE

The right ventricle is not dilated.  The right ventricle is diffusely

hypokinetic.



PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES

There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.



Pt was taken to the cath lab 7/11 where his RHC showed RA 9, PA 25/15/20, PCWP 13, CO 6.4.  Mild LAD disease, 30% circumflex stenosis, RCA 100% occlusion, stented x3 with dissection of RCA during procedure.  He also had transient reocclusion during procedure.  TIMI II flow after IC adenosine.  IABP and temp wire (for profound bradycardia) were placed during procedure.  V-gram showed basal inferior AK and anterolateral HK, EF approximately 40%.  His peak CK were 1491.

Because his initial echo showed low EF out of proportion to his ischemic event, other causes of low EF were investigated.  His serum Fe was slightly low, TSH was normal, SPEP had several low Igs but no evidence of myeloma.   Lipid profile showed Cholesterol 210, Trig 59, HDL 45, LDL 153.  HgbA1c was 6.3.  Because of reocclusion during cath, hypercoag workup was sent and was negative (including lupus anticoagulant, hypercoag panel, HIT).

He continued to have some chest pain post-cath with mild increase of CK likely d/t distal embolization.  He has now been persistently pain-free.  His IABP was d/ced 7/12.  He was continued on ASA, Plavix, Lipitor and Bblocker, Captopril were added and can be titrated up.

Re:	Russell Urban	

WRH#	4722064	





Dear Dr. Ussery:



I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Russell Urban in Cardiology Clinic today.  As you know, Mr. Urban is a very pleasant 50-year-old gentleman who on July 09, 2093, while sitting at a concert in Central Park had the sudden onset of feeling    unwell   , epigastric discomfort, and profound diaphoresis.  He came to the Worthington Regional Hospital Emergency Room at that time.  By the time he arrived, his symptoms had abated.  He had an unremarkable electrocardiogram initially and negative cardiac markers, and was admitted to the medicine service to rule-out a myocardial infarction.  That evening, he had recurrent symptoms and was noted to have sustained wide complex tachycardia, which appears to be ventricular tachycardia.  He was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for further management.  The next morning, he underwent cardiac ultrasound, which revealed an ejection fraction of 28% and a diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with an akinetic inferior wall.  Additionally his next set of cardiac markers returned positive.  He therefore went cardiac catheterization revealing a total occlusion of his right coronary artery and minimal non-obstructive disease of the left system.  This artery was stented with total of three stents (two Express stents 2.5 x 24 mm and one Pixel stent 2.5 x 28 mm), encompassing the entire length of the right coronary artery.  A left ventriculogram was performed and demonstrated an ejection fraction of 30% with a diffusely hypokinetic ventricle and and akinetic inferior wall.  He ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 1490 and a peak troponin of 2.0.  A follow-up echocardiogram was performed on July 15, 2093. This study showed his ejection fraction had improved to 36%; the left ventricle was diffusely hypokinetic and the inferior wall appeared severely hypokinetic.  His reduced ejection fraction was out of proportion to his degree of coronary disease.  Because of this, a series of laboratory tests were performed which revealed normal iron studies, normal thyroid function, and a normal serum protein electrophoresis pattern. He was discharged in stable condition to follow up with me as an outpatient.



Since his myocardial infarction, Mr. Urban has been feeling quite well.  He has returned to work in the factory where his employed as a manufacturing manager.  He has had no symptoms of angina, dyspnea, nausea, or diaphoresis.  He has felt very well.  He continues to take his medications without difficulty, and denies any symptomatology whatsoever.



His past medical history prior to this hospitalization is largely unremarkable because he had not sought medical care.  Of note, he reports to me that about 8 or 9 years ago while living in Georgia, he presented to an emergency room with some chest discomfort.  He was evaluated and released.  He never had any further testing.  He did not have a stress test, cardiac ultrasound or catheterization.  Prior to his admission, he did not have any known hypertension or hyperlipidemia, but has been diagnosed with these conditions while in the hospital.



His medications include aspirin 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, lisinopril 10 mg daily, and carvedilol 6.25 mg twice each day.  He has no known drug allergies.



Ms. Urban is originally from Nicaragua but after working for Imports, Inc, he moved to Georgia where he lived for 24 years working as a Registered Nurse and in various other positions.  He immigrated to America about a year or so ago.  He has been working in Borders.  He currently lives in Toledo, Montana, with his wife.  He has no children.  He smoked 1 to 1-1/2 packs per day for about 30 years, but has not smoked since his hospitalization.  He drinks only socially and denies illicit drug use.



He has a family history of coronary artery disease in that his father had 3 myocardial infarctions and died at a young age of heart disease.



On physical exam, his blood pressure was 130/82 mmHg in his right arm and 126/80 mmHg in his left arm.  His heart rate is 60 and regular.  In general, he is in no apparent distress.  His jugular venous pressure is 6 cm of water.  His chest is clear to auscultation without rales, wheezes, or rhonchi.  His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S1 and S2.  He has no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  His abdomen is benign.  His extremities are warm and well perfused and without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  On vascular exam his carotid pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits.  His femoral pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits.  His right femoral artery was entered for cardiac catheterization.  The site looks clean and intact with no hematoma and no bruit and a strong pulse.  His distal pulses are 2+ and symmetric throughout.



His lipid panel from his hospitalization reveals total cholesterol of 210 mg/dl, LDL of 153 mg/dl, and HDL of 45mg/dl.



His electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm.  He has T wave inversions in III and aVF, and he has a greater than 15 degree disparity between his R and T wave axis.



Mr. Urban underwent a exercise treadmill test with sestamibi imaging yesterday.  He exercised for 10 minutes 43 seconds achieving a maximum workload of 12 METS, and a peak double product of 21,600.  His electrocardiogram was negative for ischemia.  His nuclear images revealed a mild reduction in tracer activity in the inferior wall which persisted after reinjection consistent with his inferior myocardial infarction. There was no evidence of ischemia elsewhere.  His left ventricular ejection fraction was measured at 51%.



In short, Mr. Urban is a 51-year-old who had an inferior myocardial infarction, but interestingly during his hospitalization had systolic dysfunction well out of proportion to his coronary disease.  Also, his systolic function has improved over time.  I think there are two processes going on.  One is coronary artery disease.  Clearly this has manifested itself as an inferior myocardial infarction due to an occluded right coronary artery, which was treated during his hospitalization with stenting.  The other issue is his transient systolic dysfunction that is out of proportion to his coronary artery disease.  Given the rapid improvement in his ejection fraction, I can only speculate as to the etiology of this.  He does not appear to have a persistent cardiomyopathy, but a transient one.  I suspect that this is myocarditis.  Unfortunatley, I have no way of proving this for certain but clinically it seems to fit.  It is possible that whatever led to his myocarditis also triggered his acute coronary syndrome.  



From the aspect of his coronary artery disease, he will continue on aspirin for life.  He received quite a substantial amount of stenting to his right coronary artery, and I would opt to continue his Plavix for at least 12 months.  For his hyperlipidemia, I agree with Lipitor, and we will recheck his lipid profile to see if the dose of Lipitor is adequate.  His LDL goal will be less than 100.  He is well beta-blocked on his carvedilol, and we will continue with the current dose of 6.25 mg twice daily.  His blood pressure allows us to increase his lisinopril from 10 to 15 mg daily.  I will see Mr. Urban again in three months for followup.  I will repeat his echocardiogram in six months' time to see where his ejection fraction has settled out.



Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this very interesting and pleasant gentleman.  The patient was seen and examined, and the case was discussed with Dr. Orville Ness.



Sincerely,









Jimmy Orozco, M.D.

Dear Dr. Ussery:



I saw Mr. Urban in follow-up in the office today.  Since his last visit in November, he has been feeling well.  He has had no angina, no exertional dyspnea, no shortness of breath, no orthopnea, no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, no palpitations, and no other symptoms of note.  Since his last visit with me, he has participated in and completed outpatient cardiac rehabilitation.  He found this program to be very helpful; he sis very well with the program.  He is currently exercising on a regular basis and has no chest discomfort of dyspnea with exercise.  He has stopped smoking.  There have been no difficulties with his medications.  



On 03/16/2094, he had a follow-up echocardiogram done; this study shows an LV ejection fraction of 37% with septal hypokinesis and inferoposterior akinesis; there is trace mitral regurgitation; and aortic sclerosis, but no stenosis.  Notably, he has a right ventricular systolic pressure estimated to be 46 mmHg with a right ventricle that is mildly dilated and mildly-to-moderately hypokinetic.  He has been feeling quite well and has no other symptoms.



His review of systems is as above and is otherwise negative in detail.



Medications:

Aspirin 325 mg daily

Plavix 75 mg daily 

Lipitor 40 mg daily

lisinopril 10 mg daily

Coreg 6.25 mg daily.





Physical examination:

He appears quite well and is in no apparent distress.  His blood pressure is 112/60 mmHg and his pulse rate is 50 beats per minutes and regular.  His JVP is 7 cm of water with no Kussmaul's sign.  His chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S1 and S2.  He has no S3 or S4 gallop and no audible murmurs.  His abdomen is soft.  It is neither tender nor distended.  He has normal bowel sounds.  His extremities are warm and well perfused.  He has no edema.



Impression:  This is a 50 year-old man with coronary disease who suffered an inferoposterior myocardial infarction in July 2093.  Additionally, he was also found to have cardiomyopathy with an LV ejection fraction of 37 percent.  He is currently asymptomatic from his coronary disease and his LV dysfunction.  Notably, his last echocardiogram shows that he has increased RV systolic pressure and some early right ventricular dysfunction.  The etiology of this right ventricular dysfunction is not clear.  There is likely a component of left heart failure.  In addition, he may have right heart failure out-of-proportion to left heart failure: he has a longstanding smoking history and may have a degree of COPD and, lastly, he may have obstructive sleep apnea.  He reports to me that he does snore at night, and his first wife in Georgia had told him for many years that during the night he had periods were he would stop breathing.  This raises obstructive sleep apnea as a consideration.  



Recommendations: Initially, I am going to start him on Lasix 20 mg daily to lower his preload to help with any component of LV failure that is leading to this.  The rest of his regimen is quite good, and I intend to continue them.  To help to see if there is any component of cor pulmonale that may be contributing to this, I am going to obtain first a chest x-ray, secondly a pulmonary function testing, and lastly a sleep study.  If indeed we find components of obstructive lung disease or obstructive sleep apnea, we will have him see a pulmonologist and treat these accordingly.  I will see him again in six months' time.



Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this pleasant gentleman.



Regards,

Cardiac Access Admission Note

Russell P Urban

# 472 20 64



9/19/95



Mr Urban is admitted s/p PTCA/stent x 2 (Cyphers) to his LCX today



History of Present Illness	

     This 52 yo gentleman has known CAD dating back to an MI in 7/93. He underwent RCA stenting at that time, jailing the RV marginal with sluggish flow afterward. Post MI ECHO showed EF of 36% w/diffuse HK.

     He underwent f/u ETT w/imaging in 8/93 which showed a small fixed inferior defect with considerable residual viable myocardium and no evidence of ischemia. EF at that time was 51%. He has done reasonably well since then.

    In late spring, Mr Urban noted some chest tightness and SOB similar in quality to his prior angina, but markedly less severe, which occurred with exertion. He had a repeat ETT 7/31/95. EKG was positive for ischemia. Imaging showed a defect that was c/w ischemia. His meds were adjsuted, but his symptoms have persisted.

    Today he presented for elective cath +/- via SDA. Cath showed his RCA to be totally occluded, with 2 LCX lesions. His LCX was stented with 2 cyphers (3.5 x13 and 3 x 23) with good results. He was put on reopro and transferred to Cardiology where he arrived pain free and in no distress.

Increase ASA to 325 mg QD and add plavix 75 mg QD indefinitely. He is at high risk of progressive disease given his early RCA ISR. Continue reopro as ordered. Remove sheaths once PTT normalizes. Ambulate once activity restrictions lifted.

     Continue heart healthy diet, exercise, meds as ordered. Weigh daily, strict I&O given hx CHF after his MI. LP(a) was 24 last draw- Dr Orozco will consider adding niaspan after evaluating effect of zetia/lipitor in clinic.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 


Mr. Austin is a 78 year old Ecuadorian gentleman with known Diabetes and history of cerebellar CVA but no HO CAD who returned from Ecuador 2 days ago.  He left Angels City after I saw him in January when he was free of angina.  While taking an afternoon walk in Quito during early June he experienced fairly severe mid-sternal pain without diaphoresis; pain radiated  to the left upper arm and patient discribed it  as ""sharp burning pressure"".  He went back home and rest releived the pain he estimates within 15 minutes. There days later pain reccurred, again it lasted about 15 minutes but this time he went to ED.  An EKG was ""normal"" and he was discharged on NG. Approximately one week later he experienced another episode of CP similar to the previous ones, he was taken to another hospital and he was hospitalized. On July 1st he was catheterized and found to have ""diffuse CAD"" involving several vessels. Stent placement was not attempted. His LV EF was 55% and he was transferred to a medical ward. A day later, on July 3rd, he was readmitted to the ICU because of CP; he was stabilized and eventually discharged on July 5 on the following medication: 


ASA 81 mg
Plavix 75 mg po qd
Bisoprolol 5mg po qd
Isosorbide 20 mg one po in am 1/2 po in pm
Ranitidine 300 mg po qd
Lipitor 40 mg po qd
A sleeping medication 3 mg ?Lexotan one po hs
Metformin 1000 mg po bid


Mr. Austin has been pain free since his discharge until today when he was readying himself to come to the hospital. He then  experienced a brief episode of pain in mid sternum without radiation to the left shoulder which had been present during previous episodes. It is worth noting that ETT here  in 2091 was suggestive of CAD but stress echocardiogram was  was read as not suggestive of ischemia:


Testing performed:  STRESS ECHO, DOPPLER, COLOR DOPPLER     M-Mode:        2D Quality: Conclusion:     1.  Patient exercised  6 min 20 sec on a standard Bruce treadmill protocol,    reaching stage 3, and stopped secondary to fatigue.  No chest pain was    reported.  Maximal heart rate attained was 123 bpm (84% of maximum HR    predicted for age), and BP at peak exercise was 154/68.    The maximum    rate-pressure product was 18,942.2.  See exercise report for full ECG details.        Baseline resting ECG is normal sinus rhythm.      There were 1 mm horizontal/upsloping ST depressions in leads V3-6 and      lead II at peak exercise.3.  Baseline resting echocardiogram reveals:         Normal left ventricular size and systolic function.  Estimated resting       ejection fraction is 60%. No resting segmental wall motion       abnormalities.       Trace mitral regurgitation.4.  Echocardiographic images obtained immediately following peak exercise    reveal:      Normal increase in overall systolic function, with an estimated ejection      fraction of &gt;80%.      All segments augment normally, without inducible wall motion      abnormalities.SUMMARY:  No echocardiogrphic evidence of infarct or inducible ischemia, atslightly less than target heart rate (which decreases the sensitivity of thisexam).ATTENDING STAFF:        WINSTON,LATASHA V.,M.D.,PH.D.
  
Mr. Austin has  Type II diabetes on oral hypoglycemics and h/o CVA in 2090 which resulted in right hemiparesis (now fully resolved) who was last seen in January.  At that time he denied any symptoms suggestive of angina.   


Glycemic control ahs been variable.  Last HGBA1C in 11/85 was 7.8.  Lately there has been an increase in fating levels.  Today BG 162. Last week 112 at home. He is no longer exercising.  Has nocturia X2 but without dysuria. Denies polyuria, polydipsia, nause, chills and fever. Appetite normal. 


 He has residual right shoulder pain after a fall in Dec 2094 which was significantly improved by  steroid injections. Episode of bilateral low-pitched  ringing in his ears has abated. Uses two pillows. No PND, orthopnea and leg edema. Denies vision changes. .  Denies episodes of light-headedness or vertigo.  


PMHx:
H/O diabetes mellitus type 2 : h/o poorly controlled diabetes, which improved and then deteriorated. 

Cataracts. He was seen by Ophthalmology and was told insurance does not cover cataract surgery which he needs.

Dear Gray:




 

I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. Henry Oswaldo in clinic today. As you know, he is a 78-year-old gentleman with diabetes who was hospitalized at 06/28/2096 in Quito with any acute coronary syndrome with anterior myocardial infarction.  I am seeing him on your request to evaluate him for possible coronary artery bypass surgery.  I have reviewed his records and I have summarized the findings.   



The patient denies having had symptoms of angina until his recent visit to Quiti.  At that time in June he had several days of very sharp chest tightness and diaphoresis that were prolonged.  He then presented to the Merlin Clinic in Quuto. He was found to have an anterior myocardial infarction and underwent catheterization there that showed a critical stenosis of the LAD ( sequential lesions 95 and 99%), first OM(90%) and his right ( dominant vessel with an 80% proximal and then 90%  distal). An LV gram showed an EF of 55% with just mild mitral regurgitation.  An echo performed here at the Wyandot was consistent. 



Since he has returned to America several weeks ago, he has only had one episode of his chest discomfort, which occurred when he was getting rushed to come to the clinic. Since then, he has had no further episodes. 


ROS: Denies PND, orthopnea, symptoms of TIA, stroke, lightheaded, or syncope. He does get some pain in his right leg with exertion.


PMH: Diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,  stroke (numbness in his right hand and leg, but that had predominantly resolved).


Meds: aspirin 81 mg a day, clopidogrel 75 mg a day, bisoprolol 5 mg once a day, ranitidine 300 mg a day, atorvastatin 40 mg a day, metformin 1000 mg b.i.d., and Imdur 20 mg in the morning and 10 in the evening. This is an Equadorian formulation.


SHx:
He does not drink, nor smoke.


FHx:  Cancer of the prostate and a mother who died of cancer at 60. Brother who is diabetic and the other who had cancer of the prostate.



On exam, he looks well. His heart rate is in the 64. His blood pressure was 115/70. His carotids were 2+ with normal upstrokes and no bruits. His jugular venous pressures were not elevated. His chest was clear to auscultation. His cardiac exam revealed a  2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex. His abdomen was soft. Extremities were warm and well perfused with good femoral and distal pulses. Neurological exam is grossly normal without focal deficit.





In summary, Mr. Oswaldo is a very nice Spanish speaking 78-year-old gentleman with diabetes and a significant 3-vessel disease. He is likely best suited for CABG and I spent a significant amount of time explaining why stenting his situation would be less satisfactory.  I will obtain a screening duplex ultrasound of his carotids to assess this risk prior to proceeding.



With warm regards,  


Sincerely yours,","Record date: 2096-10-04

Dear Dr. Jean:




 

Your patient Henry Oswaldo was seen today by myself at the Atmore Community Hospital today following coronary artery bypass on August 15, 2096 .  He has had a relatively unremarkable recovery with out complication.  Today,  Mr. Oswaldo  looks and feels well, and complains of no issues.    On examination, the lungs are clear, cardiac rate and rhythm are normal. The  incision is healing very nicely.   


Chest radiograph reveals normal findings.  EKG shows no acute changes and is basically normal.  His rate is mildly elevated today despite being on a beta blocker. 


Patient education was completed with respect to:  medication review, weight restriction/lifting/activities, cardiac rehabilitation.


Overall, I am quite pleased with progress.   He has increased activity and should plan to enroll in cardiac rehabilitation in a few weeks.  He  seems to be making an excellent recovery from surgery.  


Thank you for the privilege of participating in the care of this very nice gentleman.  I am confident the surgery will afford  significant and lasting benefit and relief from symptoms of angina .  I would consider increasing his Toprol dose, but will leave this to your discretion if his rate remains elevated in follow-up. I am releasing  him to your care.  We would be happy to see him at any time in the future, if you should so desire.  



With warm regards,  


Sincerely yours,","Record date: 2096-11-18

Assessment: 58 year-old man with a history of CAD CHF, and OSA who presents with weakness, weight loss, SOB, and ARF in the setting of increased diuretic use.   



Plan:

1.	ARF: 

-responding to slow hydration, will aim for euvolemia and hold diuresis and ACE-I. Gentle IVF at this time given tenuous balance between being dry and volume overloaded, will reassess volume status in the AM along with AM lytes

-hold lasix, ACE-I

-Urine lytes obtained in the ED difficult to interpret in the setting of diuretic use

-check Urine Eos (per attg)

-Renal U/S (per attg)

-treat UTI (levoflox x 10 D), f/u UCx

2.	HTN

-continue lopressor, hold Cartia XT and Altace

3.	SOB: Expected improvement in symptoms with diuresis but patient actually reports worsening of SOB.  Last ECHO demonstrated normal RSVP but concern now for progressive primary pulmonary process contributing to R heart failure not L sided dysfunction.

-repeat ECHO in the AM 

4.	DM

-holding metformin in the setting of ARF

-half home NPH dose with SSI

5.	CAD

-hold lipitor given renal failure,

-continue ASA, toprol, 

6.	Dispo

-Return to home

Booked for CPE, but current symptoms took precedence.  



Pt presents very discouraged over escalating Lasix doses and persistant problems with reccurent edema and cough, each time relieved by increasing diuretics, so ACEI cough seems unlikely.  Avoiding all salt in diet with good compliance.  Did see sleep lab tech, tried new settings and mask on new machine, but still tolerates poorly.  When discussed in some detail, notes feelings of suffocation with wearing mask for any period of time.  Also notes sense of being tied down frrom mask very difficult to tolerate.  Without exploring details greatly, we discussed potential role of PTSD in precipitating symptoms related to mask use, and potentially  the effect of nocturnal hypoxia and RV strain on accumulation of fluid.  Improving tolerance of CPAP seems very key.  Pt has started atkins dt with good success (6# in first week), and improving BGs are requiring reduction in insulin, which is great.  so it seems that addressing OSA is the key to improving overall status now.  We discussed some options...Including potential for tracheostomy to fix this without having to address mask, but agreed to try to initiate trial of CBT to see if we can improve mask talerance with symptom reduction.  He remains quite clear that he has no interest in furhter ""exploring"" the PTSD history, and I reassured him that CBT does not require doing this.  



OSA:  Likely has near optimal mask set up now...We'll explore potential for CBT with sleep center or perhaps cardiac rehab source.  Hopefully this would address fluid imbalance to a greater extent as well.  



DM:  improving with wt loss and diet.  Agree with insulin taper as sugars drop.  UAMLB high but < 1 year ago, recheck in future.  Creatinine stable 2 months ago, recheck renal panel with labs.  Optho and podiatry current.  



Lipids: last LDL was an outlier..Has slip fro repeat FLP.

well controlled.  



Peripheral vascular disease : claudication limited Sx with limited exercise tolerance.  



Obesity :  adtkins dt as above.  



Glaucoma : Dr. Russo, HWS, gets regular f/u.  



Insomnia : since service. NTI helped a little in past, not after a while. CBT might help if successful.  



Reviewed HM, mostly up to date, should get Td update at some point or if wound, counseled.  



Most of 40 minute visit counseling on CBT, PTSD, sleep apnea, and concern about failing regimen.  

Emailed Barbara Fierro, Sleep center, Dr. Yeargin, and Dr. Ingham of Rehab to help identify best CBT practitioner for this.

			Reason for visit:

   A 59 yr old IDDM man  s/p CABG in 25 with IDDM and CHF admitted after elective cardiac cath which revealed new RCA occlusion for post hydration/Mucomyst/bicarb.



			Interval History:

   Cardiac history began in 2125 with inappropriate sinus tachycardia. A cardiac echo revealed EF of 64% with no valvular disease and normal wall motion. An Aden MIBI 4/25 revealed inferior and PL ischemia and he was taken to the cath lab. The cath revealed mild pulmonary hypertension, PCW of 14, co-dominance with 65% PDA, moderate LCX disease and severe proximal LAD lesion. HE subsequently underwent CABG with LIMA to LAD, radial artery to LCX and VG to PDA. 1/26 he noted progressive DOE with upper chest discomfort and was brought to the cath lab. His PA pressure was 45/20 with a PCW of 20, all grafts were open and his BB and lasix were increased.

An Aden MIBI 12/27 showed an EF of 60% w small PB scar & inferior-lateral ischemia. Echo 2/28 revealed new LA enlargement with EF of 62%. He was admitted 1/29 with HF exacerbation/acute renal failure in the setting of rapid out-patient diureses with zaroxolyn.  (BUN 74, creat 2.2) Diuretics as well as Glucophage and ACE I were held and he was discharged with a creat of 1.2. An echo revealed new mild MR and RF of 59%. 

Over the last few months he has noted episodes of sudden lightheadedness/dizziness, floaters. He would take his BP with a home machine and it could be as low as 77/47. In addition, he has noted progressive DOE as well an now rest angina that is requiring a SL TNG for relief. He has 3 flights of stairs to climb to his apartment and uses 1 SL TNG prophylactically.  

An exercise adenosine MIBI was done 6/14 which revealed an EF of 75% with mild anterior  and IPL ischemia. He was admitted for a cardiac cath 6/20, however due to a creatinine of 2.4 only a right heart cath was done. It revealed  RAP of 7, RVP of 36/17, PAP of 35/17, PCW of 17 and CO 5.9.

Given his episodes of sudden hypotension as well as increasing creatinine, Diltiazem as well as Ramipril and Aldactone have been held. He reports no further episodes of hypotension since stopping these meds.

He is being followed by Dr You in renal service.

Of note, he continues to use the oxygen at night.(2 liters NP)



Cardiac cath today revealed normal LM, TO mid LAD with LIMA to LAD filling distal LAD, mild LCX disease, RCA is totally occluded with distal vessel filling via VG to RPDA, VG to RCA small vessel but patent, LIMA to LAD patent. Althought the RA graft to the PDA and VG to LCX are patent - they are small and atretic.

Re:  William Potts
     MR#  109-16-75-8
 
Dear Matt:
 
I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Potts in follow up today.  As you
know, he recently had a complicated hospital course.  He underwent
cardiac catheterization, which revealed serial stenoses of the LAD
including 70% and 90% stenoses.  The first marginal branch had a
60% ostial stenosis.  The right coronary artery had 60 and 80%
stenoses, respectively.  The PDA had a 70% narrowing.  Given his
very significant wish not to have bypass surgery, it was decided to
proceed with angioplasty of the right coronary artery as well as
the obtuse marginal.  It was felt that the LAD was a small vessel,
and not worth going after at this time.  The RCA was successfully
stented, but was complicated by occlusion of the posterior left
ventricular branch.  By the end of the procedure, flow had been
restored to some degree to the posterior left ventricular branch,
but Mr. Potts rule in for a small subendocardial myocardial
infarction.  Due to the closure of the left posterior ventricular
branch, the obtuse marginal branch was not dilated.  
 
Mr. Potts underwent two exercise tests post procedure. The second
exercise test was performed with MIBI imaging.  He exercised for
nine minutes on a submaximal Bruce protocol, and experienced chest
pain.  He had a maximal blood pressure of 148/72 and a heart rate
of 121.  MIBI images revealed a small nontransmural myocardial
infarction of the basal 1/3 of the inferior wall.  There was
moderate to severe ischemia of the inferolateral territory in the
territory of the RCA.
 
Given these findings, it was highly recommended that Mr. Potts
undergo bypass surgery.  
 
Mr. Potts was discharged on aspirin, Ticlid 250 mg b.i.d.,
Atorvastatin 20 mg q.h.s., Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d., Imdur 60 mg q.d. 
He also takes vitamin E and a multivitamin.
 
Of note is that Mr. Potts has been under quite a bit of stress
recently.  His 89-year-old mother has been at Whitehead recovering
William Potts
MR#  109-16-75-8              -2-       January 5, 2070
 
from a hip fracture.  He is having difficulty arranging the
appropriate insurance to cover her medications. 
 
Mr. Potts has been experiencing chest pain since discharge.  This
occurs with increased activity, and is relief with either rest
and/or 1 nitroglycerin.  He has decreased his work level
considerably, and is relatively sedentary.
 
On physical exam, he was well appearing and in no distress.  He had
a blood pressure of 112/70, with a heart rate of 60.  His weight
was 203 pounds.  Chest was clear to auscultation and percussion. 
Cardiac exam revealed a flat JVP of 30 degrees, a nondisplaced PMI
with a normal S1 and S2, without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. 
Carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.   His abdomen is soft,
nontender.  There is no organomegaly, and no hepatojugular reflux. 
Extremities are without edema.
 
Electrocardiogram reveals a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 61. 
Intervals are .16/.08/.42, with an axis of -10 degrees. There are
flipped T-waves in III and AVF.   I did not have an old
electrocardiogram here for comparison.
 
Therefore, Mr. Potts returns today still experiencing angina with
mild exertion.  He has agreed to undergo coronary artery bypass
surgery.  He has found out that if he is cleared to go back to work
by his physicians, that the Screen Actor's Guild will make a good case for this. 
There has been precedent for those who have had bypass surgery to
return to work as an actor.   Given Mr. Potts's current
feeling, I will make an appointment with Dr. Earl Jacob as soon
as possible for him to be seen prior to scheduling bypass surgery.
 
It is somewhat worrisome that Mr. Potts will be caring for his 89-
year-old mother at home, along with his wife.  His mother currently
uses a walker, and I have warned Mr. Potts that he really cannot
exert himself to any great degree in terms of helping his mother in
the house.  He understands this, and if his chest pain should
become more frequent, intense, or prolonged, he will immediately
call me.  
 
If Mr. Potts is not scheduled for surgery, I will see him in two
weeks at NDNH.  
 
With best regards.
 
Sincerely,

1.  Chronic kidney disease.  This remains stable.  However, he should be on an ACE inhibitor.  I will initiate lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily, substituted for diltiazem.
2.  Borderline glucose tolerance.  The patient will return for 2 hour glucose tolerance test.
3.  Low HDL.  Remains quite low in the setting of coronary artery disease despite treatment.  We will continue TriCor.
4.  History of prostate cancer.  No evidence of recurrence.
5.  Hypertension.  Good control.  Substitute lisinopril for diltiazem as noted above.

CC: Lightheadedness, vertigo, and presyncopal sx x several episodes



HPI:. 64 yoM w/ significant PMH for CAD, HTN, GERD, and past cerebral embolism presents w/ 6 hour history of vertiginous symptoms, dizziness, lightheadedness, and feeling ""like [he] was going to pass out"".  The pt recalls waking and getting ready for work.  He then began having short episodes of vertiginous attacks in which he felt the room was ""constantly going out of focus"" and inability to ""lock in on any one thing"".  The pt had several episodes of these presyncopal attacks w/o LOC.  The pt had no associated CP or palpitations, however noted some increased rate of breathing.  The pt also noted some reflux sx a/w attacks.  He denies f/c, ns, d/c, diploplia/photophobia.  Had associated nausea without vomiting as well as tinnitus, which he usually has.  Attacks began to affect driving so he presented to EW.



Pt has one prior episode similar to this experience in 2082, for which he received imaging studies including CT of the head, MRI/MRA, TCDs which revealed no infarcts, but poor flow in the mid-basilar artery.  TTE at that time showed an intra-atrial septal aneurysm.

Reason for visit:

   F/u of coronary disease and hypertension.   



Interval History:

   Ted continues to feel well. He has not taken nitroglycerine for 6 months. He exercises for 25 minutes 3 days per week on the treadmill and does not get chest pain. He does continue to gain weight because of dietary caloric indiscretion. He is not having any edema or orthopnea. 



Family history:

   Brother has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. 



Physical examination:

-General:   No acute distress.

-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.

-Heent:   Unremarkable

-Neck:   Carotids 2+ without bruits. JVP no jugular venous distention.

-Chest:   Clear to auscultation and percussion.

-Cardiac:   Left ventricular impulse discrete and nondisplaced. Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, with no S3 +S4. There were no murmurs, clicks or rubs.

-Extremities:   No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. 2+ femoral pulses without bruits. 2+ pedal pulses.

-Neuro:   A&O x3, CN 2-12 grossly intact. 

-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds, soft and has mild epigastric tenderness, with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.

-BP: 127/55  

-Pulse: 43  

-weight: 185  lbs.

-BMI:   



EKG:

   Sinus rhythm, intraventricular conduction defect, poor RWave progression, unchanged from previous.





Impression:

   Ted continues to do well. I discussed with him the reason for his persistent positive stress test and the posterolateral redistribution being related to the circumflex occlusion. There is good collaterals to this territory and I told Ted he needs to continue to exercise to build up those collaterals. We will repeat a stress test on him next spring to make sure he has not had progression of disease in his other arteries.

RE:BRADY DUVALL

RAH#425 03 15 1

 

Dear Denny:

 

Just a note to tell you that I saw Brady Duvall again today for his 

congestive heart failure.  His clinical course is well known to you.  

He has had a slight increase in peripheral edema.  This has occurred 

despite a medical regimen that includes Lasix 40 mg daily, aldactone 25 

mg daily, Coumadin, atenolol 25 mg daily, amiodarone 200 mg daily, 

insulin, vancomycin that was recently discontinued, Zocor 80 mg daily, 

clonopin, Plavix, and glucophage.  He is also on captopril 6.25 mg po 

t.i.d.

 

From a functional point of view, he seems to be stable although, as 

noted, he has had a slight increase in peripheral edema.  His past 

clinical course is well known to you.  As you know, he had an 

epicardial abscess from electrode placement.  

 

From a clinical point of view, he is otherwise stable.

 

Physical examination today is of note for a weight of 193 pounds, blood 

pressure 120/60, with a resting pulse of 76.  Neck veins are distended, 

with positive hepatojugular reflux.  His carotid volume is diminished.  

His lungs are

generally clear, without rales or rhonchi.  Examination of the heart 

reveals a quiet precordium.  There is a soft S3 gallop, no murmur of 

mitral regurgitation, and no obvious murmur of tricuspid regurgitation.  

Abdomen is of note for a liver at the right costal margin.  There is +2 

peripheral edema.

 

The resting electrocardiogram shows paced rhythm.

 

We will be increasing his Lasix to 80 mg daily and following him 

closely by telephone over the next several days.  I have made no other 

changes in his current medical regimen.

 

Many thanks for letting us participate in his care.

 

With best regards.

 

Sincerely yours,

Re:  Brady Duvall

     MR #425-03-15-1

 

Dear Patricia:

 

I saw Brady Duvall again today.  He has been very stable

clinically over these past six months.  I believe this represents

a composite of the following three major changes in his medical

regimen.  As you know, we have discontinued all beta blockers,

and this has been associated with a symptomatic stability.  He

had biventricular pacing box placed, certainly contributing to

his overall improved status and he is now taking a regular dose

of Lasix.  He is on 80 mg alternating with 40 mg per day.  He

does have symptoms of fatigue, but his overall volume status is

quite reasonable.  He is currently on Aldactone 25 mg daily and

Lasix 80 mg per day alternating with 40 mg per day, Captopril

6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d., Zocor, insulin, Glucophage, aspirin, and

mexiletine.  His amiodarone has been discontinued.  He does have

asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia, often paced out of this,

but I am reluctant to recommend ablation therapy for him at the

present time.  He has not been shocked by his ICD.

 

Functionally he seems quite stable.  He does have mild fatigue,

but is otherwise reasonably active.  He will hopefully be

traveling to Miami this spring.

 

Physical examination today is of note for a weight of 184 lbs. 

His blood pressure is 118/70, his resting pulse 69.  His neck

veins are in fact, quite unimpressive.  There is minimal jugular

distention, perhaps 6-7 cm.  There is no hepatojugular reflux.  

 

 

Re:  Brady Duvall

     MR #425-03-15-1                 -2-                07/18/98

 

Lungs were clear.  Examination of his heart reveals a quiet

precordium.  S1 and S2 seem normal.  No S3, no gallop and no

murmur or mitral regurgitation.  Abdomen is benign without

palpable liver or spleen and there was no peripheral edema. 

There are bilateral varicosities.

 

His electrocardiogram shows pace rhythm.

 

Mr. Brady Duvall is currently stable on this regimen. 

Accordingly, I have made no changes.  I have checked appropriate

electrolytes.

 

Many thanks for letting us participate in his care.

 

With best regards.

 

Sincerely,

  RE:  Adler, Imogene

  MRN: 618-13-82-6

  

  

  Dear Dr. Yingling:

  

  Thank you for referring your patient, Imogene Adler,

  for her problem of coronary ischemia.  As you know, Ms.

  Adler is a 49 year old woman with four years of

  essential hypertension and mild dyslipidemia who is

  postmenopausal and has noticed increasing symptoms of chest

  tightness associated with exertion.  A stress MIBI SPECT

  study ordered by you demonstrated inferolateral mid and

  basal inferior ischemia consistent with a left circumflex

  distribution.  The details of the study include an exercise

  protocol for which the patient exercised for 7 minutes and

  15 seconds for 8.9 mets, with an increase in heart rate from

  74 to 159 (which is 94% of predicted peak heart rate), and

  increase in blood pressure from 134/80 to 210/80 (with a

  rate pressure product of 33,390).  The test was stopped due

  to fatigue and moderately severe chest pain.  EKG

  demonstrated 1.5mm of upsloping depression in II, III, F and

  V4-V5, and there were no noted arrhythmias.  

  

  Her past medical history is otherwise unremarkable and her

  current medications include estrogen, Premarin, Provera, and

  verapamil 240mg q.d.  A recent lipid panel demonstrated a

  total cholesterol of 203, LDL of 142, and an HDL of 39.

  

  On physical examination, she is comfortable, well appearing

  woman with a weight of 186 pounds, pulse 68 beats per minute

  and regular, blood pressure 140/82 in the left arm.  Jugular

  venous pressure was approximately 6-8cm of water.  Carotids

  demonstrates normal upstroke with no bruits.  Chest

  examination was clear to auscultation.  Heart examination

  demonstrated a normal S1, positive S4, physiologically split

  S2, no murmurs or rubs.  Abdominal examination was 

  

  

  RE:  Adler, Imogene

  MRN: 618-13-82-6

  Page 2

  March 23, 2079

  

  

  

  unremarkable.  Peripheral examination demonstrated no

  peripheral examination and 2+ bilateral peripheral pulses.  

  

  EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm and otherwise normal

  EKG.  

  

  I reviewed the findings suggestive of an obstructive

  coronary lesion in the left circumflex distribution and the

  probability of her having single vessel coronary artery

  disease as the culprit for her chest pain.  We reviewed the

  options which include medical therapy and/or coronary

  angiography and possible angioplasty.  I made no solid

  recommendations for her, but suggested that the angioplasty

  approach was a relatively low risk approach which may lead

  to curing the obstructive lesion as opposed to medical

  therapy, which would also be a well supported decision, and

  I reviewed the evidence to suggest medical treatment of

  single vessel disease does not shorten one's life span and

  only affects the quality of life depending on the symptom

  tolerance.  She and her husband are going to reflect on

  these recommendations and get back to me by the end of the

  week.  If she does decide to undergo coronary angiography

  and possible angioplasty, we will schedule her immediately

  in Cardiology.

  

  I have scheduled follow-up in one month regardless to see

  her in the office.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if

  I can be of any further assistance.

  

  With warm regards,

Assessment and Plan



Chest pressure and dyspnea. The patient has known coronary vasospastic events for which she has consulted with cardiology. The symptoms that she describes suggest possible symptomatic cardiac ischemia. She had a baseline ECG today in my office that was normal. I have instructed the patient to follow up with cardiology for further assessment and an ETT. I will communicate with Dr. Wright. The description of symptoms do not suggest unstable angina. 
Glucose intolerance with post prandial hyperglycemia. Continue metformin, well tolerated, HbA1c requested.

Assessment and plan




Chest discomfort. The patient's history and exam do not suggest cardiovascular origin but pain originated in the chest wall, musculoskeletal in origin. She had an ECG in my office that was unchanged from previous ones, there were no ST-TW abnormalities, no extrasystoles or any other abnormality. She was reassured. For musculoskeletal pain I have recommended stretching exercises, and low dose diazepam for muscle contracture. She will avoid NSAID due to GI symptoms.

Abdominal discomfort with diarrhea. The patient will follow a CHO diet and will avoid dairy products and other substances with low-absorption high-residue. In addition, in context of weakness I have recommended her to have a chemistry analysis for investigating electrolytes. Should symptoms persist then I will recommend the patient to initiate Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole.

Dehydration. The patient will initiate a strict fluid replenishment plan for rehydration.

   Chest pain, shortness of breath


	Interval History:
   Cardiology Admission for Dr. Paulson

69 y.o. male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM, CAD and CABG September 2092 presents today to ODC ED with progressively worsening shortness of breath and intermittent left jaw pain. 

The patient reports having undergone CABG in September 2092 at WMMC after developing jaw pain and shortness of breath. He was told at that time that there might be a problem with one of the grafts. Surgery otherwise uneventful. He was discharged home and developed recurrent symptoms. Cardiac catheterization was performed in early Jan 2093 at BS which, by his report, showed one occluded graft. He underwent POBA of likely diffusely diseased, intramyocardial LAD, but never really improved. Relook coronary angiography was performed about 2 weeks later showing no change. He saw Dr. Paulson for 2nd opinion about 2 months ago. His review of angio from Jan: SVG to mid RCA patent, LIMA to 2nd diagonal patent, SVG to LAD not seen and extensive LAD disease. LAD intramyocardial. LV function normal. Ranexa was added however he has not noted any improvement in jaw pain. He has progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and intermittent exertional left jaw pain partially relieved by 2 s.l. TNG. Despite greatly curtailing his activities, he is having daily symptoms. He has been enrolled at cardiac rehab but can only bicycle 2.8 mins. He phoned Dr. Paulson's office today and was advised to come to the ODC ED for evaluation.

In the ED, he appears comfortable and painfree. Did note some left jaw pain earlier. HR 73 SR, BP 122/71, O2 sat 98% RA. ECG showed NSR rate 71, incomplete RBBB with LAFB, LAE, TWI V1-V2-no important change c/w prior tracing 2/18/93. BNP, CK-MB, and TnT normal. CXR shows clear lungs.

In light of his history of CAD, CABG, prior PCI, and progressive symptoms, admitted for further evaluation.

# 070 27 68

Mr Powell is admitted to Cardiology clinic s/p cath and PTCA/stent (2.25 x 12 Taxus) to the LAD

	
History of Present Illness

This 69 yo gentleman has a hx of CAD dating back several years. He underwent CABG x 3 in 2092 at WMMC after being diagnosed with CAD after presenting with symptoms of jaw pain and SOB. Immediately after surgery he was told there was likely a problem with one of the grafts. He began to have symptoms of jaw pain and dypnea within a few weeks of surgery and presented to Beloit State where he had cath within 6 weeks of CABG- at that time his LAD graft was down and his distal LAD was stenosed. Failed attempt to stent the distal LAD, but it was PTCA'd with no real relief of his symptoms. Last year, he presented here with further progression of his anginal equivalent and underwent cath which showed further stenosis of the distal LAD. There was no PCI option available. 

He has been aggressively managed with medications and initially his jaw pain improved, but the dyspnea has persisted. Unfortunately the jaw pain has reoccurred and he has become more symptomatic. He now presented for cath. 

Today he arrived via SDA for cath that showed his native disease to be severe with a 70% stenosis involving the ostium of the first diagonal branch. The mid-distal LAD is small and tapering with diffuse disease  up to 80%. The first diagonal has a high grade ostial stenosis. LCX has 40-50% stenosis proximal to the first OM. RCA has 80% stenosis proximally with competitive flow from the SVG. The LIMA-&gt; D1 is patent and the SVG-&gt; RCA is patent. The SVG-&gt; LAD is not visualized. The mid-LAD lesion was treated with PTCA/stenting with a 2.25 x 12 mm Taxus stent. He arrived on floor 5 pain free and in no distress.

Disposition and Plans
Impression: 69 yo with CAD, s/p CABG with early graft stenosis, now s/p PTCA/stent to mid LAD w/DES

	
Plan:

	
1. Cardiac: HR/BP well controlled. Continue current meds. Full dose ASA and plavix indefinitely. Stop PPI on plavix with new DES. Recently increase lipitor to 40 mg QD- will check fasting lipids in am along with LFT's. Adjust dose further as needed. Remove sheath once PTT normalizes. Ambulate once activity restrictions lifted. 

Continue nitrates for now given intramyocardial vessel and severe native distal LAD disease. Increase activity post DC as tolerated.. 

2. Endo: Diabetic on glyburide- continue for now. Check FS BID- insulin scale as needed. 

3. GI: on protonix- will change to zantac while on plavix to prevent drug interaction with PPI's/plavix. Guaiac all stools

4. Psych: anxiety/depression- continue lexapro

Cardiac catheterization was performed in Jan 93 and underwent POBA of likely diffusely diseased, intramyocardial LAD, but never really improved. He was admitted to ODC in May 94 and cath demonstrated severe native disease with a mid-LAD lesion which was treated with PTCA/ Taxus stent. He had symptomatic relief until about one month ago when he began to experience exertional discomfort and dyspnea which has now progressed to symptoms at rest despite an aggressive medical regimen. He presented today for cath which revealed a new stenosis distal to the prior LAD stent which was patent. The lesion was stented with a 2.25 x 13 mm Cypher stent. he is now admitted to the Cardiology department for post procedure monitoring and arrived to cardio clinic pain free and hemodynamically stable.

	Reason for visit:
   chest pain


	Interval History:
   71 yo male with HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM, CAD/CABG September 2092 which was c/b premature graft failure of the SVG to LAD presents with increasing frequency of left jaw pain and chest pain for the past 4 wks. 

After his CABG, he underwent POBA of likely diffusely diseased, intramyocardial LAD in 1/93 due to recurrent angina.  He then underwent May 94 and cath demonstrated severe native disease with a mid-LAD lesion which was treated with PTCA/Taxus stent. He had symptomatic relief until 11/94 when he began to experience exertional discomfort and dyspnea which has now progressed to symptoms at rest despite an aggressive medical regimen. He then underwent repeat cath in 12/94 which revealed in stent restenosis of prior LAD stent and was stented with a 2.25 x 13 mm Cypher stent. 

He reports complete symptomatic relief after his stent in 12/94 and he was chest pain free until about a month ago when he noted left-sided chest pain and left jaw pain that was similar to his cardiac chest pain in the past.  The pain was both exertional and non-exertional.  He also noted gradually worsening exertional dyspnea as well, though he has mostly been sedentary.  He denies any orthopnea, PND, leg edema or palpitations.  He has been compliant with all medications, including ASA and Plavix.  He is currently chest pain free.

Dear Margaret,



I had the pleasure of seeing this patient in the Cardiology Clinic at the Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital.  Since I last saw Ms. Law, she underwent a 3-vessel coronary artery bypass surgery, internal mammary to the left anterior descending artery, free right radial graft to the obtuse marginal branch of the left circumflex, and reverse saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery.  She tolerated the surgery quite well and had a short rehab stay.  Currently, she is doing some walking, but is still feeling quite tired and a bit deconditioned.  However, her breathing does feel better than prior to the surgery.  She has some residual sternal wound pain, but it has improved since her discharge.



Current Medications:

1.  Aspirin 325 mg daily.

2.  DuoNeb.

3.  Diltiazem 300 mg p.o. t.i.d.

4.  Furosemide 40 mg p.o. daily.

5.  K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. daily.

6.  Metolazone 2.5 mg daily.

7.  Toprol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.

8.  Pravastatin 20 mg p.o. daily.

9.  Furosemide 40 mg p.o. daily.

10.  Colace, ferrous sulfate, ibuprofen, senna.



Adverse Medication Reactions:

1.  Azithromycin.

2.  ACE inhibitor, cough.

3.  Latex, angioedema.



On physical examination, heart rate 81, blood pressure 106/75, and weight of 246.  In general, she is well appearing, in no apparent distress.  Jugular venous pressure is 6 cm of water.  Carotids are 2+, no bruits.  The chest is clear to auscultation and percussion, a well-healed median sternotomy, regular rate and rhythm.  No significant murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, no masses, bruits, organomegaly.  Extremities:  1-2+ edema.



Review of labs dated 05/28/2134, potassium 4.3, creatinine 0.9, ALT 16, AST 16, total cholesterol 125, triglycerides 106, HDL 36, and LDL 68.



In summary, the patient is a 62-year-old woman status post CABG, doing well.  She does appear to be mildly volume overloaded today, therefore I will make the following medication adjustments.  As far as her cardiac meds, they will change to aspirin 81 mg daily, potassium 20 mEq daily, Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d., metoprolol succinate 100 mg p.o. daily, and pravastatin 20 mg p.o. daily.



I will titrate her Lasix on an outpatient basis to have her lose 5-7 pounds to improve her shortness of breath as well as her edema.  We will ask VNA to draw labs as well.



I will see her again in 2 weeks' time.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions.



Warmest regards,

RE:  Wonda Benitez
     MR #892-76-95-4
 
Dear Usha:
 
I had the pleasure of seeing one of your clinic patients, Ms.
Benitez, in my cardiovascular clinic for follow-up for palpitations,
hypertension, and status post coronary artery bypass surgery.  As
you know, she has been complaining of leg cramps mostly at night. 
She has been taking quinine for this, however develops palpitations
whenever she takes the quinine.  She has not been taking this since
the initial two doses.  I suspect that her leg cramps are probably
secondary to intermittent passing fluxes.  I have told her to eat
a banana during the evening and possibly this would avoid leg
cramps in the evening.  In the meantime, her EKG showed sinus
bradycardia at a rate of 50 per minute.  There is borderline first
degree AV block and anterolateral infarct by EKG which is unchanged
from previous tracing.  We will continue her on Vasotec 10 mg bid
as well as Lopressor 12.5 mg bid.  She will see me in follow-up in
three months' time.
 
Again, thank you for referring this patient to my cardiovascular
clinic.
 
With warm regards.
 
Sincerely,

RE: Benitez, Wonda
MR: 89276954
 
Dear Usha:
 
I had the pleasure of seeing one of your clinic patients, Ms.
Wonda Benitez, in my cardiovascular clinic for follow-up status
post coronary artery bypass surgery and pounding headaches.  As you
know, we performed a persantine MIBI recently which showed inferior
wall ischemia.  I wasn't sure whether or not this ischemia was new. 
On review of her coronary artery bypass surgery notes, she did not
have her totally occluded right coronary artery bypass.  Therefore,
I suggest that this reversible ischemia in the inferior wall is
probably old and was the result of the fact that they did not
bypass this area.  She did have a LIMA to the LAD and two saphenous
venous grafts to the circumflex territory, the OM and the diagonal. 
She has been doing relatively well with chest discomfort and I
recommended we continue her current cardiac medications.  However,
she has been complaining of pounding headaches and she did have a
history of otitis media in her right ear.  Therefore, I think it
wouldn't be unreasonable to refer her to ENT to have them evaluate
her ears as a possible source of her pounding headaches.  In the
meantime, I have suggested that she take her nifedipine and
nitroglycerin in the event that her blood pressure shoots up during
these episodes.  I suspect that her blood pressure rise during
these episodes is due more to anxiety than to intrinsic problem
with her cardiovascular system.  She will return to see me in
follow-up in three months time, at which time I will check her
cholesterol level.
 
Again, thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your
patient.  Please do not hesitate to call me if you have any
questions.
 
With warm regards,

Follow-up for labile hypertension.  At the time of our last visit, she 

began Procardia XL 30 mg daily and completed a series of 24 hour urine 

tests.  All of the urine tests returned normal.  After being on the dose 

of Procardia, she noticed some continuation of her symptoms and Dr. Iniguez 

suggested that she increase the dose to two tablets daily.  She has been 

on that dose for the last two weeks and has noticed dramatic change in 

her symptoms.  Shes having much fewer spells and her blood pressure, 

likewise is much lower than it had been.  Overall, she is pleased with 

these results.

 

Her other medications have remained the same although she has 

discontinued using immediate release Nifedipine and Nitroglycerin both 

sublingual and patches.

 

BP initially 142/52, later by me 170/68

Weight 155 lbs.

Pulse 68

Her examination remains unchanged except she has 2+ edema in her left 

leg and 1+ in the right leg.

 

Assessment:  Labile hypertension-clinically improved.

 

Plan:

 

1.  Change Procardia XL to 60 mg once daily and continue other 

medications as is.

2.  I suggested that she return for her regular follow-up with Dr. Gibbons 

and Dr. Iniguez.  I would be happy to see her in the future but do not 

feel that additional visits here are necessary.

RE:  BENITEZ, Wonda

MRN: 892-76-95-4

 

Dear Usha:

 

I had the pleasure of seeing one of your patients, Ms. Benitez, in

my Cardiovascular Clinic today for follow-up status post coronary

artery bypass surgery.  As you know, Ms. Benitez has been having a

terrible past month with increasing episodes of substernal chest

discomfort.  One episode occurred during Ramadan when she was

fasting and another occurred while she was in a restaurant.  Both of

these episodes were relieved with sublingual nitroglycerine.  I

am concerned about her discomfort because of an earlier

Persantine MIBI study showing anteroapical redistribution on her

test and the fact that it was relieved by nitroglycerine. 

Currently she denies any PND, orthopnea or chest discomfort.  She

continues to have back and bilateral hip pain and has been taking

corticosteroid shots for that.

 

On physical examination, she is an anxious, concerned, elderly

woman.  Blood pressure is 160/70 in the left arm.  Jugular venous

pulse is not observed.  She has bilateral carotid bruits.  Chest

exam is clear.  Cardiac exam shows an S4 gallop, a normal S1, a

physiologically split S2 and a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left

sternal border.  Abdominal exam is benign.  Peripheral exam shows

trace pedal edema.

 

EKG shows sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50 beats per minute. 

There are Q waves in V1 through V4, consistent with an old

anterolateral MI.  The tracing was otherwise unchanged compared

with previous tracings.

RE:  BENITEZ, Wonda

MRN: 892-76-95-4              - 2 -          November 01, 2085

 

 

IMPRESSION:  I think we should schedule Ms. Benitez for a

Persantine thallium test as soon as possible.  If she can

exercise on this test, that would be even better. When the

results are back, I will get back you regarding further

recommendations.  My hope is that we will not have to

revascularize her again.  If we do, I am hoping to do so with

potential angioplasty and stenting.  In the meantime, I have

switched her from Zocor 40 mg to Lipitor 40 mg a day in the hopes

of targeting her LDL cholesterol to the new guidelines of 100. 

Her previous LDL cholesterol was 111.  I also suggested to her in

the meantime to cut down on her physical activities until we know

the results of the thallium test and also to forgo one episode of

her steroid injection for her back.

 

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns

regarding this patient.  Again, thank you for referring her to

our clinic.

 

With warm regards,

Re:  Benitez, Wonda

     MRN: 89276954

 

Dear Usha:

 

I just had the pleasure of seeing Ms. Benitez for a follow up

cardiovascular examination.  She has been reasonably stable since

I saw her last in July.  She has had several episodes of chest

discomfort characterized as a tightness which has been quite

transient.  The frequency has been less than one time per month. 

The last occurred yesterday while she was walking in a shopping

mall.  She continued to walk and her symptom resolved.  She has

not had any associated shortness of breath or diaphoresis.  

 

She has had no symptoms of cardiovascular ischemia, denying

transient hemiparesis, hemiparesthesia, or amaurosis fugax.  She

denies claudication but does admit to back pain, bilateral hip

pain with walking.  She still notes paresthesias of both feet. 

She continues to be bothered by tinnitus as well as headaches.

 

Her current medical regimen includes losartan 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.,

nifedipine XL 60 mg p.o. q.d., aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.,

atorvastatin 40 mg p.o. q.d., metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.,

Synthroid ? 5 mcg five days per week and 10.5 mcg two days per

week, furosemide 20 mg p.o. q.d. p.r.n., quinine sulfate 324 mg

p.o. h.s. (for cramping), nitroglycerin p.r.n., Zoloft 15 mg p.o.

h.s., lorazepam 15 mg p.o. q.h.s., magnesium oxide 250 mg p.o.

q.d. and Ranitidine 150 mg p.o. p.r.n. 

 

On examination she appears well.  Weight is 142 pounds.  Blood

pressure is 140/60.  Heart rate is 50 and regular.  Neck veins

are 6 cm above the mid right atrium.  There are bilateral carotid

bruits.  Lungs are resonant to percussion and clear to

auscultation.  On cardiac exam the PMI is in the fifth

intercostal space at the midclavicular line.  There is a 1+ left

ventricular lift.  The first heart sound is normal.  The second 

 

Benitez, Wonda                                    MRN: 89276954

November 07, 2086              -2-

 

 

is split physiologically.  There is a grade 2/6 mid systolic

murmur at the apex and a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along

the left sternal border.  There is a fourth heart sound at the

apex.  Abdominal examination reveals no masses, no

hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are notable for 2+ bilateral

femoral pulses, palpable bilateral tibial artery bypass graft

pulses, absent bilateral popliteal pulses, 1+ right dorsalis

pedis, absent right posterior tibial and absent left pedal

pulses.

 

Her electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia with first degree

AV block and findings suggestive of a prior anterolateral

myocardial infarction.  There has been no diagnostic change since

July 18, 2086.

 

Carotid duplex ultrasound examination performed on October 31,

2086 showed a 55% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery

and a 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.  The

velocity of the right internal carotid artery and the subsequent

calculation of stenosis was less than it had been in February

2086.  

 

Graft scans obtained on October 31, 2086 demonstrated patent left

femoral-anterior tibial artery bypass graft with increased

velocities consistent with a greater than 75% stenosis at the mid

thigh level and this was increased from a study of August 06, 2086. 

The right femoral-dorsalis pedis arterial bypass graft was patent

with no evidence of significant stenoses.  

 

In summary, her problems relevant to this visit include:

 

1.  Coronary artery disease.  Status post coronary artery bypass

surgery.  LIMA to the LAD and SVGs to the diagonal and

posterolateral left ventricular branch.  She has occasional and

very transient episodes of angina.  I have suggested continuing

her current medical regimen.  As noted previously, I prefer to

manage her medically unless her symptoms worsen.  

 

2.  Carotid artery disease.  She is asymptomatic.  I recommend

periodic surveillance with carotid ultrasound. 

 

3.  Peripheral arterial disease.  Both grafts are patent but the

left femoral-anterior bypass graft appears by ultrasound to have

a significant stenosis.  I have asked her to discuss this finding

with you further.

aortic sclerosis and mitral regurgitation, with an

Plastic Surgery     Consult Note
Patient:  Richard, Ulysses
MRN#:  8913196
Date of Consult:  7/26/78

Chief Complaint:  Open surgical wound right leg

HPI:  85 yo WM w/ multiple medical problems presents s/p right common femoral to anterior tibial bypass with failure of his right lower leg surgical wound to close.  He has peripheral vascular disease with a prior left femoral-tibial bypass graft.  He initially presented to the vascular surgery clinic with an ischemic ulceration in the right foot. There were no lesions amenable to percutaneous intervention and he underwent right common femoral artery to distal anterior tibial artery in situ saphenous vein bypass graft on 6/01/78. He was discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility on 6/07 where he reports initially doing well. The patient was readmitted in early June because of fevers.  No source of the fevers were determined but he was started on an empiric regimen of antibiotics.  During that admission, every other staple in his wound was removed.  The patient came back to clinic where all of his sutures were removed.  The surgical site over the lower leg never completely healed and the open area was treated with daily dressing changes.  He was seen in clinic for follow-up today where his wound was again noted to be open in proximity to the graft.  Plastic surgery is consulted regarding closure options.

Vitals:  T: 96.9, HR: 75, BP: 179/78, RR: 18, O2 sat: 96% RA
Physical Examination:  
General: Alert, oriented, NAD, good historian
Lower extremities:  Multiple well-healed incisions.  On the right lower extremity, there is an incision from the groin to the foot.  It is well-healed with the exception of a 5 x 2 cm area over the lower third of the leg just medial to the tibia.  The graft is palpable just lateral to the area.  The base of the wound appears to have granulation tissue.  No odor.  There is minimal erythema and tenderness around the site.  Distal pulses palpable. Foot warm and well-perfused but with no sensation below the ankle.  There are other venous stasis ulcers in various stages of healing.  The great toe has an ulcer with overlying eschar.

Relevant Laboratory Values:
Pending

Assessment: 85 yo WM w/ multiple medical comorbidities presents with need for wound coverage of a right saphenous vein bypass graft.  This may be amenable to local flap coverage.

Recommendations: 
-Tentative plan wound debridement/possible flap closure this week
-Will discuss with Dr. Ring (covering for Dr. Velasco) and plan to assist with closure.
-Preoperative labs and studies pending.
-Continue daily dressing changes for now.

The patient was discussed with Dr. Uriah Wills.

Name:  Richard, Ulysses
Medical Record: 8913196
Attending:  Snyder

History of Present Illness:  Mr Ulysses is an 85 yom with h/p PVD s/p multiple bilateral lower extremity revascularizations and a non-healing wound on the RLE.  Most recently, he had undergone Rle necrotic ulcer debridement (07/78),R CFA to distal anterior tibial BPG on 05/78.  The wound was overlying the BPG.  He was made NWB on R, with VAC dressing applied to the wound to be changed twice weekly.  He has been followed in clinic.  Though he was noted to have good granulation tissue during his hospitalization one month ago, recently his wound has been concerning for non-healing.  In clinic, his RLE is ischemic, and there is a concern for wound infection.
The patient reports that the proximal aspect of his wound had pregressive breakdown over the past 2-3 weeks, with associated increase in pain, especially with VAC changes.  He says that he could no longer feel a palpable graft pulse as he could just after the surgery.  His foot became increasingly discolored, and his toe became necrotic after some minor trauma without response to silvadene.
No fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting.

	Interval History:
        Ms. Fagan notes that she is doing very well.   She does not have any chest pain and only rare dyspnea.   She has not had any dizziness and lightheadedness.
     She had previously been on the CVH pancreas transplant list and had full cardiac workup including recent dobutamine echo which revealed normal LV function and no ischemia.   However, there was concern about her extensive visceral and iliac vascular calcification by CT which rendered her high surgical risk.    She is understandably upset about this reclassification and is here today for an overview of her cardiac status.

REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Armando Newton, M.D.

Mrs. Francesca Sergio-Steven is a 72-year-old Hispanic female who presents with a new-onset acute MI.  She has no known prior manifestations of coronary disease, but has a long history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension.  She had been in her usual state of health until about 2 weeks ago, when she began to have episodes of chest discomfort.  She has only had two such episodes until the morning of admission, when she developed severe episode of chest pain at rest associated with shortness of breath.  She presented to the emergency room here where she was found to have new-onset ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads with a coving morphology involving the lateral leads as well.  There was also poor R-wave progression V1 through V3.  She was taken urgently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where she was found to have a markedly elevated wedge pressure at 30 mmHg with a normal cardiac index and blood pressure.  She had mid inferior wall and lateral wall akinesis initially with 3+ mitral regurgitation.  There was severe diffuse coronary disease with diffuse LAD disease and total occlusion of the proximal circumflex.  The right coronary artery was small with a 70% proximal stenosis.  The occluded circumflex was crossed with a wire and was stented with a Cypher drug-eluting stent.  She had an excellent result with the wedge also decreasing to 20 mmHg.  She had an estimated 70% ejection fraction despite the inferior and lateral akinesis.  Cardiac index was 2.5 with SVR of 1739.  She was then brought to the coronary care unit for further evaluation.

Her past medical history is notable for hypertension for which she takes lisinopril 40 mg q.d. and atenolol 50 mg q.d.  She also has insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and takes insulin.  Past medical history is also notable for a hysterectomy.

Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use.  She is from Paraguay and has recently arrived in this country.

Review of systems show no fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting.

On exam, she is comfortable with a blood pressure initially 160/80 with a heart rate of 70 and regular.  Followup pressure 125/80 with a heart rate of 72 beats per minute.  Head and neck were unremarkable.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.  PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 were normal with a physiological split.  There is an S4 and a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur as well as a 1 to 2/6 holosystolic murmur and mitral regurgitation at the left lower sternal border.  There is no S3.  Abdominal exam was unremarkable without organomegaly.  Bowel sounds are normal.  Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis.  Calf site is clean without bruits.  Distal pulse is decreased but palpable.

Her resting 12-lead electrocardiogram shows evidence of her evolving inferolateral MI.

Other lab values included creatinine 1.0 with normal electrolytes, hematocrit is 44.4%, white blood cell count 3.8 with platelets 322,000.  Liver function tests are normal.

A portable chest x-ray shows pulmonary edema.

Mrs. Sergio-Steven clearly has evidence of an inferoposterior MI initially with a very high filling pressure and pulmonary edema and mitral regurgitation.  She has had her circumflex, which is a very large vessel, well treated now with a drug-eluting stent, and her wedge has come down, and her mitral regurgitation is substantially improved.

At this point, we will bring her to the coronary care unit for careful management with aspirin, Plavix, heparin, continue the Integrilin, as well as Lasix and nitrates.  We will plan to initiate afterload reduction as soon as tolerated, and also plan beta-blockade to limit her myocardial oxygen demands.  She certainly has co-existent quite substantial coronary disease including primarily the right coronary artery degree and to some degree the LAD.  At this point, if she were to have developed recurrent ischemia, we would proceed to consideration of bypass surgery.

The patient was seen in conjunction with the resident, Dr.

Vue.  Resident's note was reviewed.  The patient was seen and

examined by me.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is a 73-year-old woman

with extensive cardiac history of hypertension and coronary

artery disease, IMI with any EF 40%, history of V-TACH, high

cholesterol, insulin-dependent diabetes, and status post AICD

cardiac catheterization and in the past.  The patient was in the

Emergency Department today visiting a family member.  She was

completely asymptomatic, but had her blood pressure taken which

showed a pressure of 190/98.  The patient states that she usually

takes 9 cardiac and antihypertensive medicines but the

prescriptions has run out and so for the past week or so, she has

been taking only 4 of the 9.  She is unable to say exactly which

ones.  She denies any headache, visual changes, chest pain,

shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, or lightheadedness.

 Her husband is the one in the Emergency Department today and

that is causing her some stress.  Denies any rash, joint pain,

back pain, polyuria, or polydipsia.

Please see the resident's note for details of the patient's past

medical history, surgical history, family history, review of

systems, and physical exam.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is awake, alert, in no distress with

no complaints.  Has a repeat blood pressure of 190/95 and

saturating 99% on room air with a pulse of 70.  Exam is

remarkable for a systolic ejection murmur at the right upper

sternal border of 3/6.  No JVD, with good and equal pulses. 

Abdomen is soft and nontender.  She has no papilledema and fundal

exam is clear.  Neurologically, she is oriented x3 with normal

mood and affect.

IMAGING STUDIES:  EKG shows first-degree AV block with an old

LAD.  This is considered normal for this patient and is unchanged

from before.  Urinary dip is negative.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient's usual pharmacy is

contacted.  Correct doses of her medications are obtained and

refills for 2 weeks were given.  She is told to follow up with

her primary care physician within 2 weeks.  She says she will be

able to do that and remains asymptomatic throughout her Emergency

Department stay.  At one point during her stay, her blood

pressure went up to as high as 209/98, however, on my last

recheck, just prior to the patient leaving, the pressure was

185/90.  The patient's primary care physician was contacted about

this and agrees to follow up with the patient within 3 days.

DISPOSITION:  The patient is discharged home in satisfactory

condition.

1.  Chest pain, Headaches and shortness of breath - No evidence of USA.  All likely secondary to anxiety and grief over father's death.  Patient reassured.  Will continue cardiac medications.  Return to cardiac rehab on Thursday.  Will add .5mg klonipin during the day as needed.  Continue 1mg klonipin at night.  Patient declines psychotherapy.   Also, will restart nexium as some of chest pain may be recurrence of reflux.

2.   DM - Encouraged patient to take glucophage as prescribed.  She is worried she will always have DM.  Discussed with patient importance of controlling BSs now and losing remaining weight.  She will continue to monitor home FSBS.

3.  Obesity - Impressive 90 pound weight loss.  Patient very encourage.  Continue with smaller meals.

         4.  Hyperlipidemia - Patient will restart lipitor.  Follow up fasting cholesterol and SGOT.

        5. CAD - Continue Imdur, aspirin and lipitor.  Cardiac rehab.  Follow up if new chest pain.

        6. IUD - Discussed briefly.  Stressed importance of no pregnancies with CAD.  She wants to rediscuss at end of year.

        7.  History of hyperthyroidism - Recheck.","Record date: 2085-10-30

	Interval History:

   Since last seen, Ursula notes that her weight continues to rise, and with this, her angina is clearly worse.  She has stable symptoms, nothing to suggest an ACS, but she's dyspneic with exertion and takes nitro occasionally.



Medications:  Atenolol 100 mg qd, Aspirin 81 mg. qd, Imdur 30 mg., Lipitor 20 mg qd, glucophage



Physical examination:  Reveals her to be obese weighing 231 lbs.  Her BP is 120/ palp in her left arm and her heart rate is 80. Her lungs are clear throughout.  Her apical impulse is non-displaced with a regular rate and rhythm, a normal S1 and S2, but no S3 or S4.  There is a grade 1 MR murmur noted.  There is no jugular venous distention and carotid pulses are 2+ bilaterally with soft bilateral bruits.  Her abdomen is morbidly obese.  Her extremities are notable for trace lower extremity edema.



EKG:  NSR with an old IPMI.  She also has non specific STT wave abnormalities.  When compared to a previous tracing there is no change. 



Impression:



1.CAD, s/p cath and stenting:  her angina is clearly related to her weight going up again; I worry about this, and wonder if she should have another weight loss surgery.  For the meantime, I will increase Imdur to 60 mg qd, and consider an increase in atenolol.

	Interval History:
   Ursula is seen in the Cardiology office for a followup visit.  Since last seen, she notes a number of somewhat concerning symptoms.  First of all, she is noting some mid sternal chest discomfort with exertion.  She associates this with back pain related to a remote back injury, but nonetheless with exertions she develops some degree of mid sternal chest discomfort, non radiating, associated may be with some shortness of breath.  She has not used any nitroglycerin for it.  It gets better when she rests.  She denies palpitations, PND, or orthopnea.  Her sugars are out of control.  Her weight is down, nonetheless.

Physical examination:
	
-Pulse:   80
-BP: 130/85  
-weight:   206 lbs.
-General:   Overweight.  Well appearing.
-Skin:   No rashes.  Anicteric.
-Heent:   Unremarkable.
-Neck:   JVP less than 5, possible venous hums bilaterally.  Carotids without bruits.
-Chest:   Clear to auscultation and percussion.
-Cardiac:   Apical impulse nondisplaced and discrete.  Regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1 and split S2.  Soft S4 gallop.
-Abdomen:   Obese, soft, nontender, and nondistended without hepatosplenomegaly, bruits, dilated aorta.
-Extremities:   No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

Procedures:
	
Electrocardiogram  normal sinus rhythm IVCD, old IMI.  In addition, she has nonspecific ST and T-wave changes.  Compared there is no important change.


	Impression:
   1.  Coronary artery disease status post multiple PCIs.  Ursula has the return of chest symptoms which are suggestive for angina.  I will refer her for an exercise tolerance test to better evaluate this.  I will continue on the current medication program.
2.  Hypertension.  Her blood pressure is a bit elevated.  Given her diabetes, I think it is prudent to add an ACE inhibitor.  Accordingly, lisinopril 2.5 mg QD was added to her program.
3.  Lipids will be checked.  I strongly suspect that her LDL is not well suppressed.  Our goal LDL in this case is less than 70 mg/dL.

College Station, NC 22169



Dear Dr. Fernandes:



  Dr. Nunes and I had the pleasure to see your patient, Mr. Christian Mullen, this morning in the office for a routine vascular followup.  It has been nearly 18 months since his last visit here and in the interim time, has been having discomfort involving both of his hips, thighs, and calves.  As you well know, Mr. Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and peripheral arterial disease who previously underwent left common femoral and left popliteal artery revascularization November 2088 followed by right external, right internal, and right common femoral artery revascularization in February 2089.  Despite the technical success of both procedures, he continued to have bilateral hip claudication symptoms.  When we had last evaluated him in November 2089, we had considered moving forward with CT angiography to assess the patency of his aorto-iliac anatomy.  At the time, he favored moving on a conservative course with improved walking regimen and weight loss.  Unfortunately, despite these measures, he feels quite disabled and limited by his claudication symptoms.  Symptoms are noticeable between 20 and 50 yards distance occurring in the hip area as well as extending down in to his thigh and occasionally the calves.  Symptoms resolve with sitting and resting for approximately 2.5 minutes.  He notes that symptoms will improve with standing still however sitting symptoms resolve much quicker.  He does not necessarily notice any change with inclines or going up stairs; in fact, he is actually able to climb 18 stairs to his office without limitation.



From the cardiac perspective, Mr. Mullen has been free of any symptoms of exertional chest tightness, pressure, or shortness of breath.  We understand that you are following him in closely in this regard and now requesting up coming chemical stress test given that has been nearly 10 years from his coronary artery bypass surgery.



	Past medical history:

   Hypertension.

Hyperlipidemia.

CAD.

PAD.

Prior tobacco use.

Obesity.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Depressive disorder.

Cervical spine disease.

Congenital hypospadias.

Prostatitis.

Hemorrhoids.

Colonic polyps.

Chronic normocytic anemia.



	Medications (Confirmed):

	

aspirin  325 mg qd

Atacand  15 mg qd

doxepin 

glyburide 

Lipitor  80 mg qd

Lopid  600 mg BID

Toprol XL  50 mg qd

Wellbutrin 



Physical examination:

	

-Pulse:   66 and regular

-General:   Mr. Mullen is well appearing in no apparent distress

-Heent:   Benign

-Neck:   Carotids are 2+ without bruits

-Chest:   Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without any wheezes, rhonchi, or rubs

-Cardiac:   Discloses regular rhythm with a rate of approximately 66 beats per minute.  S1 and S2.  There is no murmur, rub, or gallop

-Abdomen:   Obese, nontender, and nondistended.  There are no masses or bruits appreciated

-Extremities:   Reveals 1+ right femoral pulse with audible bruits.  Trace to 1+ left femoral pulse with audible bruit.  Distal pulses are 1+ without any evidence of edema, skin breakdown, or ulceration

-BP: 145/80    on the right



	Other Data:

   Three-vessel coronary artery bypass surgery 2082.

Status post C6-C7 disk surgery 2079.

Hypospadias repair in childhood.



	Assessment and plan:

   Mr. Christian Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial disease with prior bilateral aortoiliac revascularization here for a vascular followup with symptoms of bilateral hip, buttock, thigh, and claudication.



Mr. Mullen's symptoms at present are suggestive of vascular claudication and in the sense that they are exertionally related.  Interestingly, he has had these symptoms dating back to immediately following his revascularization procedures in 2088 and 2089.  On examination today, his femoral pulses are certainly not robust and may suggest the presence of restenosis.  We discussed with Mr. Mullen the potential of going forward with lower extremity noninvasive studies; however, these revealed supra-normal ABIs in the past secondary to his diabetes.  Likewise, we discussed the possibility of moving forward with a non-invasive imaging study i.e. CT angiogram; however, this would not provide the option of therapeutic intervention if indeed narrowings were noted.  Accordingly, Mr. Mullen is in favor of proceeding forward with diagnostic peripheral angiography plus/minus therapeutic intervention if restenosis of his aortoiliac segments are noted.



It is indeed possible that there is a contributing factor of spinal stenosis in that Mr. Mullen's symptoms are relieved more quickly in the sitting position.  Likewise, he has noted improvement upon leaning forward and against a tree.  We understand that Mr. Mullen is being considered for an upcoming chemical stress test to assess the patency for any silent coronary ischemia.  He is quite reticent to go forward with the chemical stress test though we did broach the subject of performing coronary catheterization at the time of his peripheral angiogram given that we are actually going to be in there.  He has actually requested this as opposed to going forward with the chemical stress test.  With your permission, we will perform both coronary catheterization to assess the patency of his grafts in addition to his peripheral angiogram plus/minus therapeutic intervention of his lower extremities.



Paramount to his ongoing cardiovascular fitness, we certainly recommend blood pressure of 130/80 or below and LDL cholesterol 70 or below and ongoing exercise and weight loss.  We will plan to schedule his procedure in the upcoming weeks and he is to notify us if symptoms are progressed in the interim time.

I saw this patient and personally obtained the history of present illness.  I also reviewed and confirmed the PMH, medications, social and family history, and detailed ROS. I personally performed a comprehensive cardiovascular examination, including assessment of VS; auscultation of carotid arteries, lungs, heart, and abdomen; palpation of carotid arteries, evaluation of jugular venous pressure, palpation of abdominal aorta and lower extremity pulses and perfusion, and neurologic examination for focal deficits.  I interpreted the EKG and other pertinent laboratory data.  I discussed findings with the patient and personally developed the management strategy and plans.  My findings and plans are elaborated on the note above, with which I concur.  Guy Nunes M.D.

Steven N Cooper M.D. 
8 Riverview Avenue, Suite 185
,
College Station, NC 22169

Dear Dr. Cooper:

  I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Christian Mullen today in the office in followup for his peripheral artery disease, as well as his coronary disease.  I permanently follow him for PAD, as I know he follows with Dr. Fernandes for his coronary disease.

Regarding his peripheral disease, he is status post left common femoral endarterectomy, performed at my request by Dr. Fredrick Xa couple of years ago.  This alleviated some of his left leg claudication, though he still has some residual symptoms in that left calf.  The right calf is what bothers him more, with symptoms that are earlier in onset.  They occurred about 100 yards of walking on the flat.  While Chris is affected by this, it does not preclude him from doing his usual activities of daily living.  He also continues to travel (on his way to Bogalusa with Brad Fair, his partner, next week), and also continues to work actively.  The biggest problem with his claudication is that it prevents him from being physically active enough to lose enough weight.  As he says, he put on about 80 pounds after his coronary bypass graft in 2082, and he has had trouble losing the weight. He is considering weight reduction surgery, but has not made a decision about this yet.  He is struggling with the decision.

I would support him either way in this regard, encouraging him to lose weight however he can do so.

In terms of his lower extremities, his exam demonstrates diminished pulses (absent to palpation) in both ankles, but they are audible by Doppler.  Both feet are well perfused, with good capillary refill.  He has no ulcers or gangrene.

From a cardiac standpoint, Chris is doing well.  He denies significant dyspnea or chest discomfort, although he is limited in terms of walking because of his legs.  It has been 11 years since his bypass operation, and I think it would be reasonable to do a stress test on him to make certain that there is no evidence of silent ischemia.  While this might be controversial, as to whether to do a stress test or not, my own gut feeling is that it is probably the right time in this patient with significant risk factors and limitations on the basis of his lower extremity disease.  He requests specifically we do this study here, so I will take the liberty of ordering an adenosine MIBI, and certainly will forward you the results.

Otherwise, Chris is doing great.  We will continue to work on risk factor modification and I will see him again in six months.  We will also order an exercise ABI and duplex of his lower extremities to assess where we stand at the present time.  If his symptoms progress to the point where they are more disabling, then we would consider further evaluation.  Otherwise, as long as his symptoms remain stable and his lifestyle is not terribly limited, we will continue the same.


	Other Data:
   I saw him today with Vernon Galvan, one of my cardiovascular fellows, who have written a detailed note. We will send this along to you as well.

Thanks again.

Best personal regards,

RE:  Follow-up of coronary and peripheral arterial disease.

Dear Dr. Cooper:

  I had the pleasure of seeing Christian Mullen in the office today with Dr. Nunes. 
As you know he has an extensive coronary and peripheral arterial disease history. He last underwent intervention on his right leg vessels in December 2093. He underwent PTA/Stenting of the right external and common iliac arteries and PTA of the right common femoral/Profunda arteries. As you know, he previously has had patch endarterectomy of his left common femoral and common iliac and popliteal stenting on the left.

He previously has undergone CABG in 2082 with repeat angio in 2091 showing patent IMA to LAD graft, patent SVG-OM1 graft, and occluded grafts to OM2 and RCA. He underwent rotastenting of his native RCA with a BMS at that time.

Additionally, he has asymptomatic moderate RICA stenosis with mild LICA stenosis.


He returns today for review. He remains in reasonable health. He is still struggling to lose weight and is interested in bariatric surgery. He has limiting bilateral claudication worse since his last visit, on each side. He also has dyspnea on exertion but does not describe angina. However, it is now 3 years since his last nulcear perfusion study. He does not report any neurovascular symptoms.



	Past medical history:

-Extremities:   No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. 2+ femoral pulses with bruits. Doppler + right DP/ PT biphasic signal, doppler (+) left DP/PT monophasic signal
-BP: 130/60  Bilaterally


	EKG:
   NSR (73), normal axis, IVCD, no acute ischemic changes.


	Impression:
   Mr Mullen is a 74 year old gentleman with extensive PAD andCAD now limited again with recurrent intermittent claudication. He is now also 3 years since his last perfusion study for coronary ischemia. Finally, he warrants repeat duplex of his carotids.


	Assessment and plan:
   1. CAD- will continue current medication regimen and arrange Nuclear Adenosine MIBI stress test.

2. PAD- worsening claudication, will review angiographic images and plan for repeat catheterization to re-intervene.

3. Carotid disease; currently asymptomatic, will repeat CANIs.

I saw this patient and confirmed the history of present illness, PMH, medications, and ROS. I also confirmed the cardiovascular examination and interpreted the pertinent laboratory data.  I discussed findings with the patient and developed the management strategy.  My findings and plans are elaborated on the note above.  Issues:1) 12 years out from CABG. He is experiencing increasing DOE, which is likely due to his weight and other factors. but I am concerned that we make certain his myocardial perfusion is OK.  Will order Stress MIBI.2) PAD- claudicating L&gt;R leg...calf.  Rutherford 2.  Disabling. Has signif disease previously treated. Will review films and consider repeat CTA to decide whether he warrants relook and repeat intervention. He is s/p CFA/Profunda endarterectomy.3) Weight - will provide him names of Bariatric surgeons here at BMH.4) Carotids - asymptomatic. repeating CNI's

CHIEF PAIN COMPLAINT:  ""I have pain in the back radiating down my legs."" 

 

PAIN HISTORY:  The patient's pain started spontaneously about two years ago.  It is located in the lower back, radiating to the back of the legs, to the level of the knees.  The pain is brought on by walking and made better by stopping or sitting down.  Bending over forward also helps the pain.  There is no numbness or weakness associated with the pain.  The pain is better at night than during the day.  The patient has separate pain complaint, which is burning pain in her feet, is worse at night than during the day.  Patient denies bowel or bladder changes. The patient has tried Celebrex, Vioxx and Motrin but has not found any relief for her pain.  She currently does not take any pain medications.  She denies a history of heartburn, gastric or duodenal ulcers or GI bleeds.  She has trouble falling asleep and staying asleep because of the burning pain in her feet. She is being referred to us by Dr. Ebert from Neurosurgery after an MRI scan showed spinal stenosis at L5-S1 and at L4-5 as well as spondylolithiasis between L4 and L5.  She had been reluctant to undergo surgery and was therefore referred to see if epidural steroid injections could help.  

 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease with myocardial infarction four years ago.   

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Coronary stent placement times two in December 2074.  

 

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Metformin 500 mg q. day, Monopril 40 mg q.  day, baby aspirin 81 mg q. day,  HCTZ 12.5 mg q. day, Norvasc 5 mg q. day and Pravachol 20 mg q. day.

      Assessment and plan:
    Mrs. Vanmeter presents today stating that she continues to have some mild nighttime chest discomfort, responsive to SL TNG. Her last stress test was in January 2082 and was without ischemia with a posterobasal scar (Adeno MIBI). A recent echo in June 2081 done to evaluate increased LE edema was normal.


Problems:
      


Coronary artery disease  -  She reports an increased frequency of her nighttime CP and takes SL TNG when with good relief. Takes it about once/month. These episodes only occur at night when she is in bed.  Her echo showed preserved LV function and no significnat valvular disease.  A repeat adenosine MIBI was negative for recurrent ischemia with an inferobasal scar and LVEF 54%. I advised her to take an H2 blocker before bedtime and if symptoms don't improve, seek a workup with her PCP.


      


Hyperlipidemia  -  Her last lipid profile showed that her LDL was in range at 67, and her TG were normal! I advised her about the metabolic syndrome and the importance of careful diabetic control as well as regular exercise.  Continue her present dose of statin.


      


HTN  -  Her BP is well-controlled today. Continue her current regimen.

RE:  Christine Olivier
     MR #652-33-21-5
 
Dear Dr. Arteaga:
 
Mrs. Olivier presented to the office today for a second opinion
regarding her current cardiac condition.  As her history is well
known to you, I will repeat it briefly for our records.  Mrs.
Olivier is a 62-year-old woman with a longstanding history of
coronary artery disease.  After several catheterizations in the
2060's which failed to document significant coronary artery disease
(done for evaluation of chest pain), angiogram in July of 2071
showed moderate circumflex coronary artery disease for which she
was managed medically.  However, she suffered a non-Q wave
myocardial infarction on February of 2072 at which time she
underwent cardiac catheterization now showing progressive coronary
artery disease and therefore underwent a multi-vessel coronary
bypass graft operation including a left internal mammary artery to
her LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to her PDA, D1 and obtuse
marginal branch.  She underwent repeat catheterization in February
of 2073 at the Comfrey Clinic which showed diffuse native disease
but apparently no significant bypass graft pathology.  She
underwent repeat cardiac catheterization in May of 2074 because of
a current angina and at this time she had evidence for a 60%
proximal LAD stenosis, a proximal severe circumflex artery stenosis
with no occlusion at the origin at a first obtuse marginal branch
and a 70% stenosis in the mid right coronary artery.  The saphenous
vein graft to the diagonal branch was patent with a significant
stenosis at its distal and astigmatic site, a saphenous vein graft
to the second obtuse marginal branch was patent as was the
saphenous vein graft to the posterolateral branch.  The left
intramammary artery to the LAD was a small vessel without discrete
stenoses.  Left ventriculogram demonstrated a moderate area of
posterior basal akinesis with a global ejection fraction of 60%. 
She therefore was transferred to the Midwest Eire Center
in early June where she underwent successful PTCA of her vein graft
to her diagonal artery.  She tolerated this uneventfully and was

discharged and since then has not had significant exertional chest
discomfort.  Her primary complaint is one of fatigue and mild
exertional dyspnea.  She has undergone extensive pulmonary
evaluation in the past including pulmonary function tests which
have revealed an FEV1 of 1.3 which is 59% predicted, and an FVC of
1.5 which is also 55% predicted giving her a pattern consistent
with restrictive rather than obstructive pulmonary disease.  In
addition, she has a history of a seizure disorder, diabetes,
hypertension and a nonspecific peripheral neuropathy.  
 
Medications at present:  NPH insulin 60 units sub q qAM, CZI
insulin 30 units sub q qAM, NPH insulin 60 units sub q qPM, enteric
coated aspirin one tab po q.d., atenolol 50 mg po b.i.d., Captopril
25 mg po t.i.d., amlodipine 5 mg po q.d., simvastatin 10 mg po
q.d., nitroglycerin prn, Nitropatch .2 mg for twelve hours of a
twenty-four hour period, Neurontin 300 mg one tab po t.i.d.,
Trusopt one drop ou q.d., Alantin one drop ou q.h.s. and albuterol
inhalers two puffs q.i.d. prn.
 
Cigarettes - none at present.  
 
Physical exam reveals a well-nourished mildly overweight woman in
no acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 140/70, heart
rate 75 and regular, respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 172
pounds.  The neck is supple.  JVP flat.  Carotids are 2+ without
significant bruits.  Chest is clear with a trace right basilar
rhonchi.  Cardiac exam shows a normal S1, physiologically split S2
and a I-II/VI systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to
the base, no significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is
benign with bowel sounds well heard.  Extremities without
appreciable edema.  Peripheral pulses are intact.  There is 1+
bipedal edema. 
 
Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 75.  PR interval
of .14, QRS .08, QT .34, axis -20 degrees.  There is evidence of a
left atrial abnormality and poor R wave progression in leads V1
through V3.  
 
Impression:  Mrs. Olivier is a 62-year-old woman with significant 
atherosclerosis, diabetes and now a chief complaint of modest
exertional dyspnea and fatigue.  She denies any active chest
discomfort and apparently her recent angioplasty was successful at
alleviating the chest pain syndrome.  The records available to me
indicate that there is no continued efforts to diminish her beta
blocker therapy however in the past this had lead to an
exacerbation of her angina.  However, now that she is status post
her PTCA it is possible she now again will tolerate beta blocker
reduction and therefore, I suggested she decrease her atenolol to
50 mg po q.d.  She will have her blood pressure checked within the
next several days and assuming she remains asymptomatic, I will

also try diminishing her amlodipine in part because of peripheral
edema and in part because she may no longer need this.  Otherwise,
I have made no specific alterations to her medical regimen except
to encourage her to continue her aerobic activity level as best she
can and watch her saturated fat and cholesterol intake and stay in
close contact with you should her chest pain syndrome at all recur. 
I would be happy to assist in her management in any way you deem
appropriate.

RE:  Christine Olivier
     MR #652-33-21-5
 
Dear Dr. Arteaga:
 
Mrs. Olivier returns for routine follow-up.  Currently, she
complains of mild exertional fatigue and rare exertional chest
discomfort.  In addition, she states that she has no energy and
worries that her coronary artery pathology has returned.  She
reports occasionally taking sublingual nitroglycerin for chest
discomfort but this is on an infrequent basis.  
 
She remains on a plethora of medications including NPH insulin 64
units sub q qAM along with 34 units CZI sub q qAM and 68 units NPH
sub q qPM, enteric coated aspirin one tab po q.d., Captopril 25 mg
po t.i.d., Lasix 40 mg po b.i.d., simvastatin 10 mg po q.d.,
amlodipine 5 mg po q.d., Neurontin 900 mg po t.i.d., atenolol 50 mg
po q.d., estrogen 0.05 topically q three days and a nitropatch .2
mg per twenty-four hours which she wears for twelve over 
twenty-four hour period.
 
Physical exam reveals a well-nourished woman in no acute distress. 
Blood pressure right arm sitting 140/80, heart rate 85 and regular,
respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 174 pounds.  The neck is
supple.  JVP flat.  Carotids are 2+ without significant bruits. 
Chest is completely clear.  Cardiac exam shows a normal S1,
physiologically split S2 and a I-II/VI systolic ejection murmur
radiating from the apex to the base, no significant diastolic
murmur or rub.  The abdomen is benign.  Extremities without
appreciable edema.  Peripheral pulses are intact.
 
Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 85.  PR interval
of .14, QRS .08, QT .32, axis -20 degrees.  There are mild diffuse
nonspecific ST-T wave changes as well as evidence for left
ventricular hypertrophy.  Compared to her last electrocardiogram,
her heart rate is slower and her ST-T wave changes are less
prominent.
 
 
Olivier, Christine
MR #652-33-21-5               -2-            December 05, 2074
 
Impression:  Mrs. Olivier has currently recovered from her 
multi-lesion PTCA and stent placement therapy.  Currently it is not
clear to me that her symptoms are secondary to recurrent ischemia,
however I will have her undergo an exercise tolerance test
(adenosine MIBI) to help to further evaluate this.  In addition, I
will obtain routine blood studies including an glycosylated
hemoglobin.  It is certainly possible that her fatigue and
generalized sense of lack of energy is from a non-cardiac cause. 
Pending review of these lab studies however, I have not altered her
present regimen.  She will contact you or myself should her chest
pain syndrome at all progress in terms of severity or duration.  
 
Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.
 
Sincerely yours,

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The resident's note was reviewed, 
and the patient seen and examined on arrival.  This is a 
65-year-old female status post multiple angioplasties and stent 
placement.  She had recurrence of her typical angina at home, took 
three nitroglycerin with minimal relief, and activated the 911 
system.  Her pre-hospital electrocardiogram shows a small amount of 
ST depression, perhaps 1 mm, and flattening V3-V6.  This is 
comparable to a previous electrocardiogram in October, which may 
have been her most recent presentation with ischemia.  She was 
given aspirin and nitroglycerin, and continued to have pain in the 
Emergency Department.  The total duration of pain was approximately 
two hours. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her vital signs remained stable. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Her initial enzymes were flat. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  She is being taken to the Cardiac 
Catheterization Laboratory for an urgent study to rule out acute 
coronary syndrome. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Rule out unstable angina. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 
taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory.  The condition at 
the time of this dictation is favorable.

Re:  Christine Olivier
     MR #652-33-21-5
 
Dear Dr. Arteaga:
 
Mrs. Olivier returns for follow-up.  Since last seen, she reports
return in a non-exertional left shoulder discomfort syndrome,
occasionally associated with mild dyspnea.  Of note, she underwent
a dobutamine MIBI stress test last June for evaluating a similar
syndrome, and at that time she developed her typical chest and left
back pain syndrome in association with no diagnostic EKG changes at
a peak heart rate of 127, peak blood pressure of 160/60.  A
simultaneously obtained SESTA MIBI scan revealed a global left
ventricular fraction of 42%, a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction
involving 2 out of 20 segments of the inferior wall and minimal
peri-infarct ischemia.  In addition, a venous duplex ultrasound
study done to evaluate her severe left greater than right
peripheral edema showed no evidence of DVT.  
 
Currently she remains on a regimen of amlodipine 5 mg poqd,
atenolol 50 mg poqd, simvastatin 10 mg poqd, lisinopril 10 mg poqd,
Nitropatch .4 mg q.12 hours, Neurontin 400 mg potid, furosemide 40
mg poqd (recently increased), Lamactil 150 mg pobid, Trusopt and
Xalantan drops, insulin 10 units of CZI with 72 units NPH qam and
74 units NPH qpm. 
 
Physical exam reveals an overweight woman in no distress.  Blood
pressure, right arm sitting - 110/70, heart rate - 70 and regular,
respirations - 12 and unlabored, weight - 174 pounds which is four
pounds below her weight of six months ago.  The neck is supple with
JVP flat.  Carotids are 2+ without significant bruits.  Chest is
clear.  Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2, and
a I/VI holosystolic murmur radiating from the apex to the axilla. 
No significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is benign. 
Extremities reveal marked left greater than right pedal edema. 
Peripheral pulses are diminished.  
 
Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 70, PR interval
of .12, QRS of .06, QT of .36, axis of -25.  There is borderline

Re:  Christine Olivier
     MR #652-33-21-5
 
 
evidence for left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary ST and T-
wave changes.  Compared with the last electrocardiogram, there has
been no significant change. 
 
Presently, Mrs. Olivier has evidence of continuing chest and left
shoulder discomfort which she believes is similar to her pre-bypass
surgery angina.  In this setting, a dobutamine stress test
performed last June showed no evidence of provokable ischemia.  I
have spent some time discussing with Ms. Olivier our various
therapeutic and diagnostic options.  She made it quite clear that
she would not consider repeat cardiac catheterization at this time,
and furthermore, was very disinterested in pursuing the possibility
(should she require it) of either mechanical or surgical re-
vascularization.  It is not entirely clear to me that her left
shoulder syndrome is in fact ischemic in origin, and she certainly
understands it may be secondary to musculoskeletal abnormalities. 
I have suggested that she discuss that further with you.  In the
meantime, I have asked her (as her back and chest discomfort
syndrome appears to occur mostly at night prior to lying down for
bed) to apply her Nitropatch in the evening and take it off in the
morning.  She will call me within the next several days to report
how this helps her discomfort syndrome.  I do not believe that she
is having GERD to explain her symptoms.  In light of her reluctance
to undergo any further diagnostic cardiac studies, I will try to
tailor her anti-ischemic medications to minimize her chest
discomfort syndrome.  I, of course, will keep you fully informed as
to her progress, and I thank you for allowing me to assist in her
care. 
 
Sincerely yours,
 
 
Irineo Tovar, M.D.

LOUIS,ROBERT   855-88-85-2                   VISIT DATE: 01/10/72

This patient was interviewed and examined by me exclusively.

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient is a 67-year-old 

male who has known atherosclerotic coronary heart disease 

manifested by myocardial infarction approximately five years ago.  

He also has congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 

25%, and this is thought to be due to alcoholic cardiomyopathy 

given a substantial history of alcohol ingestion.  Over the past 

several months, he has stopped taking his medicine because he could 

not get to his doctor and felt he could not buy the medicine.  Over 

the past two weeks, he has been beset by palpitations and dyspnea 

on exertion as well as palpitations at rest.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He has had no vomiting, diaphoresis, radiation 

of the pain, change in bowel habits or any cough.  All of the 

systems are negative.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  He has had no significant surgeries.

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  He consumes alcohol slightly, 

once smoked in the past, but does not any longer.  He lives with 

his family.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Physical examination shows a 

patient who is awake, alert, calm and oriented.  He is in no 

distress at the time of examination.  EYES:  He had no scleral 

icterus.  NECK:  There was no adenopathy.  His thyroid was not 

palpable.  CHEST:  His chest was clear.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  His 

cardiovascular exam showed a regular rate and rhythm.  ABDOMEN:  

His abdomen was soft and nontender.  EXTREMITIES:  His extremities 

showed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  SKIN:  He had no rash.  

NEURO:  Neurologic exam was physiologic.

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Electrocardiogram showed tachycardia and 

T-wave inversion diffusely, which was unchanged from prior 

electrocardiogram.  His CK and troponin were unremarkable.  His 

troponin was 1.1, which was similar to a previous admission.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was treated with beta 

blocker and aspirin in the Emergency Department.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:

1.  Angina pectoris.

2.  Hypertension.

3.  Tachycardia.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was  

admitted to the Medical service for further evaluation.  He was 

admitted in satisfactory condition.

Dear Mr. Louis, 





It was very nice to see you again the other day.  I hope you are doing well.  I am writing to let you know about your recent test results.  





The following tests were essentially negative, normal, or unchanged from prior testing and do not require follow-up at this time.

1) Kidney test.

2) Cholesterol.  Your cholesterol results are as follows:

     Total Cholesterol = 129,

     HDL (the 'good' cholesterol) = 43,

     LDL (the 'bad' cholesterol) = 70,

     triglycerides = 82.

My records indicate that your total cholesterol has increased since 01/11/2072.  Given your medical history, we would like to keep your LDL (the 'bad' cholesterol) below 100.  Please continue to follow a heart-healthy diet.

3) Hemoglobin A1c.  This is a blood test that indicates how well you have controlled your blood sugar over the past 3 months.  For patients with diabetes, we would like to keep it below 7.  Your Hemoglobin A1c value was 6.5 on 04/04/2073.  It has remained stable compared to the last value of 6.5 on 07/12/2072.  Please continue to check your sugars regularly and take Metformin as prescribed.

4) X-ray.  No fractures were detected on the X-ray of your spine, but it did show changes consistent with osteoarthritis.





The following tests were abnormal or require follow-up.

1) PSA.  As we discussed during our visit, this is a blood test that measures activity in your prostate, and is one way to measure your potential risk of prostate cancer.  This is not a perfect test, and its use for prostate cancer screening is controversial.  My records indicate that your PSA has mildly increased since 4/01/72.  I recommend that you follow-up with a urologist for a prostate biopsy, which we can arrange when you return for your follow-up appointment.  At that time, we will again discuss the specifics of the PSA test and the risks/benefits of different treatment/follow-up options.





If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach me at my office at 191-537-1871.  I will see you on 5/16/73 at 9:40am for our next appointment.

EDVISIT^85588852^Louis, Robert^11/12/74^HANEY, ULYSSES

I have interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the

resident's, Dr. Burton', documentation, and concur except as

noted.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old male who

presents complaining of acute onset of chest pain and shortness

of breath.  The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes,

and a prior MRI who was brought in by Emergency Medical Services

for waking at 6:00 a.m. with chest pain radiating to the left arm

associated with shortness of breath.  Denied nausea or vomiting,

had no fevers or chills.  He received by EMS 2 baby aspirin as

well as 40 of Lasix for bibasilar crackles noted by them in the

Emergency Department.  The patient's old chart was evaluated

which revealed an echo on 11/06/2074 with an EF of 25%, cardiac

catheterization in October 2072 with 30% RCA lesion, and Holter

in January 2072 which showed atrial tachycardia runs.

SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, REVIEW OF SYSTEMS, MEDICATIONS,

AND ALLERGIES:  As noted.  Of note, the patient is an active

smoker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Emergency Department, the patient

was awake and alert, moderately ill appearing in mild-to-moderate

discomfort.  Pulse 90, respirations 20, blood pressure 157/90,

and saturating 97%.  HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic. 

Oropharynx clear, moist mucous membranes.  Neck:  Supple with no

meningismus.  Flat neck veins.  Respirations showed crackles

third of the way up bilaterally with no rhonchi, rales, or

wheezes.  Cardiovascularly, regular rate and rhythm without

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old male who returns to the clinic for a followup visit.  The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension.  He also had an episode of bronchitis about 2 months ago, which was treated with antibiotics.  The patient feels improved today



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  An elderly male in no acute distress.  Blood pressure is 142/90 and pulse is 64.  Chest is clear bilaterally.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Positive S1 and S2.  Negative S3 and S4.  No murmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, positive bowel sounds.  Lower extremities, no edema, nontender.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1.  Diabetes mellitus.  The patient reports blood sugars which have ranged from 106-158 and reports overall good control of his diabetes mellitus.  We will continue current treatment, especially in view of the fact that his most recent hemoglobin A1c in February was 6.1 and repeat hemoglobin A1c when he returns for his next visit.

2.  Hypertension.  The patient's atenolol was recently decreased from 50 mg to 25 mg because of bradycardia and lisinopril was increased to 60 mg because of microalbuminuria.  The patient's heart rate is appropriate at 64 even though his blood pressure remains borderline elevated.  We will check a microalbumin today.

4.  Recent TSH was mildly suppressed and we will repeat this today.

5.  Regular healthcare maintenance.  A CT of the patient's chest will be repeated when he returns for his next visit as recommended by radiology.

Dear Dr. Knapp:



It was our pleasure to care for Mr. Osborne to help with his decompensated heart failure.  He was admitted on 07/23/2082, one month after previous admission for abdominal pain.  In retrospect, that admission may have been related in part to GI symptoms of heart failure.  He came in complaining of continued GI discomfort, orthopnea, lower extremity edema, and 9 pounds of weight gain with increasing abdominal girth.  His medications at the time of admission included beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for hypertension, with no diuretics.



During his hospitalization, he underwent 7.5 kilograms of diuresis with resolution of his jugular venous pressure from approximately 25 cm to 8 cm.  His echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 20% with LV dimension of 5.1, enlarged right ventricle with mild decrease in RV function, but severe RV pressure overload with estimated PA pressure 80 plus the right atrial pressure.  After he had his diuresis, he underwent right heart catheterization, which revealed a right atrial pressure of 8, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 18, PA pressure of 65/35.  He underwent a trial with IV nitroglycerin, then with sildenafil.  The IV nitroglycerin decreased his BLANK pressures only by approximately 8-10 mm but he noted a further improvement in his dyspnea.  There was no clear improvement with the sildenafil in either his symptoms or hemodynamics.  His cardiac output varied between 3.1 and 4.5 on all the medications.  The decision was just to put him on oral nitroglycerin in addition to the other standard heart failure medications.  He also underwent a MIBI looking for any evidence of active ischemia, which there was none.



At the time of discharge, he is walking easily without postural change or symptoms.  His medications are Isordil 10 t.i.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.  He is on Toprol-XL 12.5 daily.  His lisinopril was decreased from 40 mg to 20 mg, but should he have any problems with hypotension, this could certainly be decreased further to 10 or even 5 mg if necessary to allow him comfortable ambulation.  He is on Plavix 75 mg daily as well and simvastatin 40.  His discharge blood pressure is 102/60, jugular venous pressure is 8-9 cm.  His creatinine is 1.3 with a BUN of 44, hematocrit 40, white blood count 5000, potassium 3.9, sodium 139.



It has been my great pleasure to participate in his care.  He is trying very hard to learn how to manage his disease at home, with the help of his family.  We have emphasized not only the salt restriction but also a fluid restriction to 2 liters a day, which includes all fluids,   We would encourage him to resume his daily exercise such as walking.  He has an appointment to see Dr. Anderson on 08/20/2081, and is looking forward to returning to your care. 



 I would be happy to answer any further questions about it.



Sincerely,

Frederick Q. Valladares, M.D.

Medical Director

January 27, 2089



Medical Record Number:  8751045  Francisco, Xue



Procedure:  The patient is a 56-year-old Spanish-speaking female scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Surgery is scheduled on January 28, 2089 by Dr. Xavier Israel kenneth Xenos.



Chief Complaint & Present Illness:  Patient briefly evaluated on 12/30/88 as part of preoperative evaluation for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy then scheduled for 12/31/88.  Over the past year patient has had difficulty with right upper quadrant pain as well as epigastric pain.  These episodes tend to happen more frequently after she has had a rich meal.  Other symptoms that occurred include nausea and vomiting.  Patient denies jaundice.  Today, patient states that she still has some abdominal tenderness greatest at the right costal margin and radiating into right flank.



At the time of evaluation on 12/30/88 patients had symptoms of URI and LRI.  She reported back/green sputum, mild shortness of breath and increased use of her grandson's inhaler.  After consultation with Dr. Valladares it was decided that patient should be evaluated by her primary care provider for further treatment of her respiratory tract infection and then follow-up with surgeon to reschedule her surgery.  Patient reports that she went to University Hospital and there they treated her with antibiotics and inhaler.  Unfortunately patient is unable to recall the name of the antibiotic or the inhaler.  Currently she denies any symptoms of sputum production, cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.  Also denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.



Patient does have a history of coronary artery disease.  She is status post an MI 11/82.  Patient had cardiac catheterization at OSH 12/3/82 that reportedly showed a critical mid right lesion and a mild left main and left anterior descending lesion.  12/09/82 patient underwent cardiac catheterization at PVH and a PTCA was done.  Patient did well until 10/83 when she was admitted to PVH with symptoms of chest tenderness, left arm pain, tachycardia, palpitations, diaphoresis, dry mouth, shortness of breath, dizziness, and darkening of revision.  Patient did rule out for MI by serial enzymes and there are no changes seen on her ECG.  Patient denies any difficulty with chest pain or left arm pain since that time.  She has had episodes of shortness of breath with exertion however, these seem more related to her respiratory status rather than her cardiac disease.



Stress test done 1/26 showed a normal exercise capacity (METS=7), ECG nondiagnostic for ischemia and the perfusion images were suggestive of anterior ischemia although body habitus limited the interpretation.

Radiology:

Dissection Protocol CT of 12-Dec-2091: reveals no evidence of aortic dissection. Complex cyst within the spleen. Uterine fibroids.  Degenerative disc disease.



CXR of 12-Dec-2091: The lungs are clear.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal.  The bones are unremarkable.





EKG:   

12-Dec-2091: Sinus brady with a rate of approximately 50.  Normal axis.  Normal intervals.  No ST elevations or depressions.  Q waves in leads II, III and AVF c/w prior inferior infarct.  Q waves in V5, V6.  Good R wave progression.  No atrial or ventricular enlargement noted.  No change from prior ECG's. 



Adenosine MIBI 6/20/2089: 

 The ECG response to pharmacological stress was  negative for

 ischemia. The myocardial perfusion scans show a small size, mild

 intensity, primarily fixed inferolateral defect consistent with

 prior infarct with substantial residual viable myocardium but only

 minimal stress induced ischemia. Compared to the study of 01/26 with

 treadmill exercise (RPP ~24K) the previously noted anterior wall

 defect is less apparent in the present exam.



CARDIAC CATH OF 12/09/2082:

Successful PTCA of the mid RCA with a 3.0 mm balloon with 20 to 30 per cent residual plaque and a hazzines consistent with possible small dissection.



Pt referred by Dr. YARBROUGH, underwent catheterization for

unstable angina, a positive exercise text and recent myocardial infarction.



PROCEDURE

PERCUTANEOUS TRANSLUMINAL CORONARY ANGIOPLASTY was performed on the Mid RCA using a maximum balloon size of 3.0 mm advanced through a 9YS7EZ guiding catheter.





Assessment:  Pt is a 59 year old female with h/o SLE, interstitial nephritis, GERD, h/o positive stress s/p RCA angioplasty 2082, and chronic abdominal pain who presents with c/o two weeks of intermittent chest pain reproducible upon palpation who is admitted to rule out MI with one set of negative cardiac enzymes and no EKG changes.



Plan:

1.	Chest Pain: Likely musculoskeletal in nature given reproducibility of pain on palpation.  However, given pt's cardiac history, will obtain two more sets of cardiac markers.  Adenosine stress test scheduled for a.m. with echocardiogram pending, as well.  Pt's Atenenlol switched to Lopressor during admission.  Pt Dilatrate-SR changed to Isordil.    Continuing home meds of Nifedipine and ASA.  Pt to be NPO after midnight for am cardiac testing.



2.	SLE: Continuing home dose of prednisone, as well as Vitamins C and D.  Will notify Dr. Xie that pt is in-house per request of PCP, to determine if any further Rheum w/u is necessary.



3.	GI: Will repeat amylase and lipase.  Prednisone is a known cause of pancreatitis and pt's continued abdominal complaints may be pancreatic in origin. although unlikely as elevation is minimal.

Narrative History

Pt reutrns for f/u.

She has not been taking lipitor for several weeks as ran out and did not refull Rx. 

She has had R shoulder pain for about one month. Pain is an aching quality, minimally alleviated by tylenol, exacerbated by moving rotating shoulder. Does not have frozen shoulder or sensation of morning stiffness. She is able to continue all IADL activities requiring use of the joint but notes the pain has become increasingly bothersome. She notes no weakness of her R arm, no dysesthesias or paresthesias, swelling, or history of injury. 

She has noted burning pain in lower extremities, stocking distribution x 1 year. She has pain described as ""pins"" from bottom of foot extending up both legs. She has a burning sensation of both legs that she notices particularly at night. Walking does not exacerbate or alleviate this sensation. She has not used anything to relieve the discomfort. She has no symptoms of claudication, no reported cyanosis of her LE digits, and no LE edema.

Assessment and Plan

1. Shoulder pain.

Impingement sign, pain with cross over manouver, and pain with use of shoulder to extend arm are consistent with rotator cuff injury. 

Check shoulder films to exclude acromioclavicular injury or degenerative process.

Renew Vioxx prescription (avoiding NSAIDs) in this patient on prednisone, at risk for gastritis.

2. CAD.

Pt had negative stress MIBI in 12/91 and has not had cardiology follow up for multiple years. She is being referred to the Internal Medicine ward service for consultation. Specifically, she remains on a nitrate (isordil) which may exacerbate GERD. She also merits being placed on an ACE inhibitor to prevent reinfarction.

She is well beta blocked and her BP is well controlled by the current regimen of atneolol and isordil.

Checking fasting lipids.

3. SLE.

She is being followed by Dr. Xie.

She and I are curious about her prednisone dosing and I will discuss the regimen with Dr. Xie. 

4. Prednisone.

Had BD of hip last year which was negative; continues on calcium/vitamin D.

Needs further monitoring of HgbA1C as elevated from prior measurements and hyperglycemic from steroids.

5. Mammogram.

Ordered this visit for routine HCM.

6. Pain control.

She has multiple complaints of chronic pain which are not documented in this note. She has used Vioxx previously and needs Stuart Hospital authorization which is being sought following this visit.

7. GERD. 

Well-controlled with new regimen of Protonix 40 BID.

8. LE dysesthesias.

Remeasuring A1C but unlikely to have microvascular complications without overt DM.

Starting amitriptyline. Pt educated to take prior to sleep and will reassess if sx alleviated.

9. F/u.

Pt will follow up with me in 3-4 months.

Attending note:

Pt seen and discussed with Dr. Hood, and agree with his evaluation and plan.

Pt with symptoms and signs of impingement syndrome due to rotator cuff tendinitis vs partial tear, and also tenderness and positive cross-over test c/w A-C arthritis. Will check X-ray, get PA for Vioxx, and would benefit from PT referral. If no improvement, consider MRI vs empiric subacromial/?A-C joint steroid injection.

Seems to have a painful peripheral neuropathy, cause uncertain. Will try low-dose TCA, would also check B12, consider EMG/NCV.

Will obtain cardiology review for CAD. Regardless of level of lipids, there is evidence for benefit of statin, and would encourage pt to resume. If current chest pain syndrome more likely due to GERD than ischemia, could consider D/C nitrates.","Record date: 2093-01-28

Narrative History

Here for f/u of multiple medical problems. In brief, complicated 60 yo F w/ SLE, CAD, HTN, DM, multiple histories of joint pain. She now reports she had a piece of meat about a month ago and since then has had a ""poking"" sensation within her proximal oral pharyngeal space. She notes odynophagia which she localizes to the proximal superior throat and describes being hoarse since the onset these symptoms a month ago.

She denies rhinnorhea but has had a sensation of nasal congestion. She denies cough independent or during eating, fevers, night sweats, malaise, or HA. She has a sensation of neck fullness on the left side and denies noting any focal swelling, rash, or warmth. She thinks she has an intermittent pulsatile pain at the base of her teeth that is generalized to the upper jaw. There is no N/V, abdominal pain, diarrhea or melena.

In addition, she considers her functional status to be at baseline. She denies chest pain, SOB, DOE, orthopnea or PND. Her exertion is limited to ambulation.

She denies arthralgias, new rashes, or myalgias.

She reports excellent adherence to medications.

Assessment and Plan

1. Odynophagia/hoarseness/swelling.

Constellation of symptoms concerning for mass effect involving soft tissue. Ordering neck CT I+ to examine for infiltrating process.

If unrevealing would proceed to barium swallow to evaluate odynophagia and hoarseness. 

She will continue current diet as sx do not interfere with consumption.

2. HTN.

Chronic problem. I discontinued isordil recently.

Can increase lisinopril to 10 this visit and titrate thereafter.

I would favor addition of diuretic, HCTZ, for additional management and anticipate BP mgmt will require further polypharmacy.

She is returning on 2/2/93 and will have NP visit.

3. Musculoskeletal pain/deconditioning.

RLE radiculopathy has resolved fairly spontaneously, as did the contralateral presentation, without intervention. She needs to recondition, increase range of motion and physical capacity in order to improve stamina and strength.

She has opted not to follow through with PT.

4. CAD.

Cont ASA, statin, BB, ACE.

5. DM.

Cont glipizide; continue ACE I as above. 

BG 125 today.

6. Lupus nephritis.

Cr stable. 

She has asked me to renew immunomodulatory agents but I would like to defer to rheumatology service.

7. HCM.

Stable. 

Requesting female provider to perform breast/pap. Scheduled for 2/2/93.

Attending note:

Pt discussed with Dr Hood, and agree with his evaluation and plan. 

Neck Sx as described. I don't feel a mass or adenopathy, but worth further evaluation with CT, barium swallow if sx persist. BP needs better control, goal 130/80, addition diuretic and increase in ACE-I appropriate.

Attending:  Julian Quintela/Micheal Leyva
 
CC:  Chest pain

HPI:For full details, please see SDU Admission Note of 3/22/64 and SDU transfer note of 3/25/64.  In brief, the patient is a 81 y/o man with CRI, Type II DM and hypertension who was in his USOH until Thursday evening, when he developed substernal chest pain around 7pm, associated with dyspnea, but no  radiation diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting.  The pain lasted approximately 15-20 minutes.  EMS was called, who brought him to the HCC ED, where he was found to be tachypneic, with an O2 of 85%.  His pain was alleviated with IV NTG, and BiPap improved his O2 saturation.  He was found to have an interventricular conduction delay and a positive troponin.  He was begun on aspirin, lopressor, lasix, heparin, and integrelin and sent to the cath lab, where he was found to have 3-vessel disease not amenable to percutaneous interventions.  He was sent to the SDU, where he was started on lasix 60IV BID and a CABG pre-op workup was begun.  Since admission to the SDU, he has been stable, with excellent RA sats.  His Troponin-T peaked at 2.91 and was slow to return to normal, 2.65 on last draw today. He was diuresed aggressively and transferred to the floor with no oxygen requirement, having no chest pain.
	On the floor, he was stable but had a 15-beat self-limited run of MMVT, his BP was 110/60 and he was asymptomatic, with no chest pain or dyspnea.  He was given 4 gm iv of MgSO4, 60 mEq of KCL.  Repeat cardiac enzymes drawn at the time were significant for a troponin-T of 3.73 but with a CK of 133 (303) and CK-MB of 5.2 (16.2).

	Sinus rhythm, left anterior hemiblock, ST elevations in V1-3 unchanged from previous EKGs.
A/P: 81 yo man with a history of DM2, HTN, CRI who presented with a NSTEMI and CHF.  He had a cardiac catheterization with significant three-vessel disease not amenable to percutaneous intervention and will now get evaluation for CABG. he has just experienced a 15-beat run of MMVT. 
Cardiovascular
Rhythm:  He apparently had no known episodes of  dysrhythmias in the SDU.  His arrhythmia is likely due to re-entrant circuits due to scars and fibrosis due to his MI.
Will increase beta-blocker dose to 25 mg po q8h, titrate up aggressively as tolerated.
On cardiac telemetry
Will replete K, Mg to goals of > 1.8 and >4 respectively
Pt awaiting CABG, but is on the borderline of criteria for AICD placement if CABG doesn   t happen.
Will consider amiodarone if further runs of VT, will move to ICU care
Ischemia:  Has CRI, and just had a NSTEMI with a Troponin peak at 2.91 on 3/23, but now with an increase to 3.73. He has significant 3-vessel disease on catheterization. 
 Will continue ASA/BB/Statin/Heparin.  
Will hold Plavix for planned CABG.

RE:  Michael Isenberg

HCC# - 367-41-93



Dear Dr. Uher:



I saw our mutual patient, Mr. Isenberg, today in my office for a routine followup wound check.  As you know, this is an 81 year-old man with a history of chronic renal insufficiency and diabetes.  He underwent an off-pump double bypass on 3/31/64.  He had an excellent post-operative recovery being discharged on day five.  Since home, he reports having no further symptoms of shortness of breath or chest pain.  He has been gradually increasing his daily activity and is now walking about five to ten minutes a day and two flights of steps.  I have suggested that he gradually increase his daily exercise.



On examination today his heart rate was 80 and regular.  His chest incision was well healed and his sternum stable.  His lungs were clear bilaterally.  He had mild edema at his right ankle and a well-healed endoscopic vein harvest site.  His current medications are aspirin 325 a day, Nexium 20 a day, Lisinopril 2.5 a day, Atenolol 25 a day, Plavix 75 a day, Glimepiride 1 mg. PO b.i.d., and Lipitor 80 mg. a day.



Overall, I am obviously delighted to see Mr. Isenberg having recovered without complication from his revascularization.  I trust that you have received a copy of his Discharge Summary previously.  If not please let me know and we   ll forward you this.  Thanks for letting us participate in the care of this pleasant gentleman and let me know if I can be of further assistance.



Sincerely,





Ian K. Ignacio, M.D.

Attending: Dr. Kitchen
PCP: Dr. Uher

Source: Patient, and HCC records

CC: 	 SOB

HPI: 	Mr. Isenberg is an 82-year-old male with a past history significant for HTN, DM, CRI, COPD, and BPH.  He recently underwent a two vessel CABG in April 2064. At that time he had presented to HCC in CHF and w/ an NSTEMI. Cardiac catheterization revealed severe disease in the LAD and LCx territory and moderate disease in the RCA. He underwent CABG on 03/31/2064, off-pump, w/ a LIMA to the LAD graft and an SVG to the circumflex OM. His post-operative course was uncomplicated.
He presented to DSH on 8/14 w/ SOB, found to be in CHF (BNP 482). He denies any chest pain and at DSH he had no ischemic EKG changes but was found to have positive cardiac biomarker w/ an initial TnI of 0.6 rising to 23.8 o/n. His biomarkers continue to rise and on transfer were CK 745 and CK-MB of 80.3 with a fraction of 10.7%. He was transferred to HCC where he underwent cardiac catheterization that demonstrated continued severe disease in his native vessels as well as significant stenosis of his LIMA at its touch-down and complete occlusion of his SVG. A PA line and an IABP were placed and the patient was transferred to the CCU for further management.

Mr Isenberg is a 82 yo gentleman one week out from attempted placement of right subclavian pacemaker- complicated by brief arterial puncture, prompt removal of the arterial catheter and successful compression. Duplex ultrasonography after compression showed no evidence of a pseudoaneurysm. A CTA done yesterday to evaluate his thyroid was  read as: 



"" Hematoma around right subclavian artery.  Narrowing of the artery. Apparent filling defect, most likely artifactual.  If thrombus is of clinical concern, upper extremity ultrasound may be obtained.""



On physical examination, he has mild non expansile hematoma of the right chest wall. His right hand is warm and well perfused, with 1+ radial and brachial pulses. There are no thrills or bruits.



My review of arterial components of the CT show the following:

1). Hematoma- to be expected

2). Diffuse arterial calcifications- obscures the ability to read what is or is not in the lumen.

3). Venous contrast bolus delivered on the right side- obscures our ability to discern the anatomy in the area of the subclavian artery.

4). Contrast bolus inadequate to comment on arterial anatomy.



Based on his clinical exam, and the fact that he is on an anticoagulant, a follow up subclavian artery ultrasound examination is in order. This test should be geared towards determining whether there is any evidence of a pseudoaneurysm. If there is an intraarterial filling defect, I would not pursue it. He is anticoagulated and his arm is viable. There are no stigmata of atheroemboli.

RE:  Danny Nielson

MAH#:  



Dear Dr. Lopez:



Thanks very much for referring Mr. Nielson to see me for evaluation of his lymphadenopathy.  I will review his history for you.  Mr. Nielson is a 76-year-old gentleman who states that approximately three months ago, he had some increased swelling of his left leg.  About three to four weeks ago, this became increasingly evident and the patient was evaluated at Elders Home in Brandon, Indiana.  At that point, a CT scan was performed.  CT scan of the abdomen revealed significant adenopathy in the retroperitoneal space with a 2.0 cm node between the IVC in aorta and a 1.5 cm node just posterior to that, also a 1.0 cm retrocrural node was seen.  CT scan of the pelvis performed on the same day revealed a chain of retrocrural nodes in front of the aorta and vena cava extending to about 2.0 to 3.0 cm below the bifurcation as well as bulky adenopathy in the external iliac chain with an iliac mass measuring 3.0 to 3.5 cm in diameter on the left side.  The largest node in the inguinal area measures approximately 6.0 cm in diameter.  The patient was then seen by Dr. Lopez on April 12th who noted firm edema in the left leg and referred him to me for evaluation.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  



Wegener s granulomatosis initially diagnosed in 2083.  The patient says at that point he came to the Hilton Head Medical Center with severe photophobia and was diagnosed with scleritis.  This recurred in 2093.  He has been treated intermittently with low-dose azathioprine and steroids.  He is currently on a minimal dose of steroids.  

status post bilateral knee repair

status post right-sided hip repair

history of diabetes mellitus type II

hiatal hernia

history of asbestos exposure

coronary artery disease

renal transplant donor s/p left nephrectomy in the 2060s



CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  



Micronase 10 mg po q day, Lipitor 10 mg po q day, Lasix 40 mg po q day, multivitamin, prednisone 5 mg po q day, Tylenol PM qhs and the patient is currently off of aspirin.



ALLERGIES:

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  



The patient denies fevers or night sweats.  Does report 30 to 40-pound weight loss over the last year.  Reports increasing fatigue for the last year.  Denies heat or cold intolerance.  Reports his vision has been progressively worse, especially his near vision over the last six to eight months.  His hearing is quite poor especially in his left ear, however has not changed recently.  Has had no effect of sense of smell for the last many years.  Denies trouble chewing or swallowing but does gag when he drinks water intermittently. Denies wheezing.  Does report an intermittent dry cough secondary to nasal drip for the last two weeks.  Reports a runny nose for the last two weeks.  Increase in shortness of breath over the last month.  No muscle pain or muscle aches.  Denies chest pain.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  



The patient lives at home in Bisbee, Indiana with his wife.  His wife is wheelchair bound and he is her sole caregiver.  He has four sons and two daughters.  He has grandchildren, four boys and four girls.  The patient was the long time Chief of Security for Cisco.  This job is currently held by his son.  He smoked about a pack a day from age 14 to age 50 quitting about 26 years ago.  Did drink significantly in the past, but usually only on the weekends, but did not drink everyday.



FAMILY HISTORY:  



The patient s father had colon cancer, which was apparently cured and died at age 87 of old age.  The patient s mother had breast cancer, which was cured and died at age 89 of old age.  The patient s brother had some sort of new cancer in his armpit; the exact histology is unknown.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  



Weight of 268 pounds, temperature of 97.5, blood pressure of 140/82, pulse of 84 and respiratory rate of 20.  General:  A well-appearing, well-developed gentleman in no apparent distress accompanied by his son today.  Head is normocephalic and atraumatic, thinning head of grey hair.  Pupils are equal round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  Oropharynx is moist.  No mucositis, pharyngitis, thrush or increased lymphoid tissue is seen.  The patient has a scar in the inside of his left buccal mucosa.  He has numerous actinic keratoses over his scalp and behind his left ear.  Otherwise, skin reveals no jaundice, rash or suspicious lesions.  Tongue is midline and well papillated.  The patient has a hearing aid in his right ear.  Neck is supple and somewhat full.  No jugular venous distention or thyromegaly is visible.  Lungs:  Slightly decreased breath sounds throughout and clear to auscultation.  No wheezes, rales or rhonchi.  Back:  No costovertebral angle or vertebral body tenderness.  There is a very old healed scar in the left posterior flank consistent with prior nephrectomy.  Heart:  Soft systolic ejection murmur, no gallops or rubs, intermittent skipped beats, otherwise regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2 normal.  Abdomen is obese, soft, nontender and nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly is palpable.  Extremities:  2+ edema on the right and 3+ on the left, pitting.  Lymph node exam:  No anterior or posterior auricular, no anterior or posterior cervical, no submandibular, submental, infraclavicular or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.  The patient has a 1.0 cm lymph node deep in the right axilla.  No epitrochlear lymphadenopathy.  Inguinal region:  A 4.0 to 5.0 cm left inguinal lymph node mass is palpated.  Neurologic exam:  Cranial nerves II through XII intact to specific examination.  Strength 5-/5, bilateral grip, bicep, triceps, deltoids, knee flexion and extension.  Sensory exam intact to light touch bilateral upper extremities and decreased sensation to light touch in the left lower extremity.



LABORATORY STUDIES:  



Recent laboratory values from April 12th reveals a creatinine of 1.5, glucose of 244 and calcium of 11.  Liver function tests are within normal limits.  Hemoglobin A1c is 6.  White count of 5.2, hematocrit of 33.9 with an MCV of 81 and a platelet count of 155,000.



IMAGING STUDIES:  



The patient has a PET/CT scan which was performed this morning and has not been read.  To my initial evaluation, there is notable PET avid lymphadenopathy both in the retroperitoneal space as well as in the left inguinal region.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



1.  Mr. Danny Nielson is a 76-year-old gentleman with notable lymphadenopathy both by report from the outside hospital as well as by my initial evaluation of his CT scan from Mount Ascutney Hospital.  This is very likely to be consistent with lymphoma.  I discussed lymphoma in general terms with the patient and his son.  I informed them that many lymphomas were treatable and some of them would indeed be curable.  This would all depend on the exact histology that was revealed by biopsy.  These sites of biopsy would be the left inguinal region.  I informed them that the treatments that would be considered would include either antibodies, chemotherapy or radiation and these would depend significantly on the type of lymphoma that was found.  The fact that there are no B symptoms and that he feels relatively well might indicate that this is a low-grade lymphoma.  However, the relatively rapid onset of his leg swelling in the left leg may be more consistent with a higher-grade process.  I feel that his left-sided edema is very likely due to decreased lymphatic drainage from the left leg.  However, further discussion of his lymphoma will have to wait final pathology.  I introduced the patient to Dr. Victor Ashley who is scheduled to perform a core needle lymph node biopsy later this afternoon.

2.  Cardiovascular:  I am very concerned about the patient s history of intermittent burning chest pressure.  If he will be diagnosed with an aggressive lymphoma and will need anthracycline, it would be important to have Cardiology on board.  He has a significant murmur and his symptoma are suggestive of angina.  The patient will be evaluated by Dr. Square Turk later this week.  In follow-up, Mr. Nielson will see me back in clinic next Sunday six days from now.  At that point, we should have a firm and final biopsy report in hand and the staging studies also have been completed.  At that point, we will be able to discuss therapy in a meaningful way.  The patient will call me back if problems arise in the meantime.



Sincerely,







Gene Quadri, M.D.

INTERN/MED STUDENT ADMIT NOTE, Team 3





Name:  Mr. Danny Nielson

MR #:  9156593

Date of admission: 08/28/2097

Admitting Physician: Dr. Gene Quadri, MD	

PCP: Dr. Ulises Noel

Source of Hx:  Patient, Available note

Code: Full

          

CC:     Want to get my chemo   



ID: Mr. Nielson is a 77 yoM w/ Stage IIIB diffuse large B-cell lymphoma s/p 4 cycles of CHOP and 1 cycle of R-ICE who presents now for cycle 2 of R-ICE.  



HPI:   Mr. Nielson was in his usual state of health until March of this year when he began noticing increasing swelling in his left leg over a period of three weeks.  He also developed b/l groin swelling greater on the left; the swelling in the left groin was tender.  He presented in early April where CT and PET scan of the pelvis and abdomen revealed a 6.0 cm inguinal node, a chain of nodes in the retrocrural space, adenopathy in the external iliac chain (largest 3.5 cm), and two nodes in the retroperitoneal space in between the IVC and aorta.  He underwent biopsy of the left groin mass two weeks later revealing DLBCL confimed by immunophenotyping.  Subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed polyclonal B-cell populations and an inverted CD4/CD8 T Cell ratio, with no evidence of monoclonal proliferation.  The patient underwent his initial two cycles of CHOP in May, and experienced no adverse effects except for generalized weakness.  PET exam in early June revealed larger left groin mass, improvement in lymphadenopathy, and a small pancreatic cystic lesion.  It was undetermined whether this represented treatment effect or worsening of disease.  



The patient subsequently had his next two CHOP treatments in mid June and early July.  PET scan and lymph node biopsy in early July revealed unchanged disease with evidence of fibrosis and inflammation.  The patient was seen in clinic by Dr. Quadri twice in July, with the second visit revealing increased PET avidity and persistence of the primary mass.  Given the persistence of the mass and lack of response to CHOP, the patient was evaluated by Dr. Rodgers of the WDMC one week later on 7/28 for consideration of auto-SCT vs more aggressive chemo regimen.  Due to the patient's age and consideration of risk/benefit, it was decided that the best approach would be to attempt a more aggressive chemo regimen first.  Mr. Nielson was admitted on 8/2/2097 to receive his first cycle of R-ICE with dose-reduced Ifos and carboplatin becuase of h/o nephrectomy.  He tolerated the treatment fairly well with some panycytopenia.  Patient felt the R-ICE regimen was a little    harder    on him than the CHOP regimen.  He felt effects including fatigue and constipation that resolved back to baseline in a few days.  On 8/9, he was given 2 units of packed red cells due to anemia and on 8/16, he was given a unit of pheresis platelets for his thrombocytopenia as well as two units of packed red blood cells for his anemia.  He was initially scheduled to receive cycle 2 of R-ICE on 8/22 but that was delayed due to his thrombocytopenia.  He says that he currently feels cold-intolerance and fatigue that is the same as when he first started his chemotherapy in May.  He denies any recent N/V, diarrhea, constipation, lightheadedness, orthostatic dizziness, hematuria, BRBPR, or melena.  Side effects of note from previous cycles of chemotherapy include generalized weakness, cold-intolerance, and constipation.

Team III Intern Addendum



I have seen and examined the pt and I agree with excellent Internal Medicine note above.



In brief, this is a 77 yo man w/ Stage IIIB diffuse large B-cell lymphoma s/p 4 cycles of CHOP and 1 cycle of R-ICE her now for his cycle 2 of R-ICE.  We will maintain hydration and monitor renal function as this pt has only one kidney. His type two diabetes will be controlled with his home regimen and his maintenance steroids that he takes for Wegener's will be held as they are replaced by dexamethasone via R-ICE. We will transfuse to maintain platelets over 20K and HCT over 25 as needed. His exam is non-concerning.

MAH#:  915-65-93

DATE OF VISIT:  November 10, 2097



REASON FOR VISIT:  



Mr. Nielson is a 77-year-old gentleman with Stage IIIB diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin s lymphoma who is status post four cycles of CHOP-R chemotherapy with persistent disease (documented by PET and biopsy).  He underwent salvage with two cycles of R-ICE and unfortunately continued to have PET avidity in the area.  As a result, we scheduled him to begin therapy with Zevalin next Monday.  He is here for a follow up physical and count check to make sure he has adequate platelets for this immunotherapy.  



INTERVAL HISTORY:



He describes an episode approximately one week ago of sudden onset of shortness of breath and tightness in his chest.  He sat down for approximately 10 minutes, it resolved, and has not recurred since then. However, we also have the reports of a follow up PET/CT scan which was performed yesterday which show a new accumulation of bilateral pleural effusions which the radiologist feels are most consistent with heart failure.  In addition, the scans also showe the prior area of PET avidity in the leg continues, although less avid. This area is in the medial compartment of the left thigh within the adductor muscles.  Mr. Nielson is not excited about this.  In addition, we also have results from laboratories today which show his platelets at 88,000, so  he is not eligible to begin Zevalin next week.  



MEDICATIONS:  



glyburide 10 mg 

atorvastatin 10 mg daily

furosemide 40 mg daily

multiple vitamin daily

prednisone 5 mg daily

Tylenol p.r.n.

Bactrim DS q. Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  



Weight is 260 pounds, temperature is 97.1 degrees, heart rate is 120, blood pressure is 130/80, and respiratory rate is 20.  Pain index is 0/10.  Fatigue index is 5/10.  Heart rate is tachycardic with an ejection murmur and occasional missed beats.  Lungs do have reduced breath sounds bilaterally.  



LABORATORY STUDIES:  



White blood cell count is 3.2, hematocrit is 33.5, hemoglobin is 11.4, platelet count 88,000, neutrophil count is 2.45.  Chemistries examination reveals sodium of 141, potassium of 3, chloride of 104, carbon dioxide of 28.3, calcium of 9.1, BUN of 24, creatinine of 1.6, total protein 6.3, albumin of 3.7, total bilirubin of 0.8, alkaline phosphatase of 58, SGPT of 21, SGOT of 22, and LDH of 208.  



ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  



Given his current status, we have decided to transfer him to the emergency department today for further evaluation of his cardiac symptoms, particularly to rule out myocardial infarction and assess whether he is, indeed, in new heart failure  We attempted to contact cardiology for an outpatient evaluation, but we were unable to do so.Therefore, he will be transported to the emergency department for an emergent workup of his new symptoms.  I suspect he will be admitted.  Hopefully, they will be able to get his cardiac issues under control.  Unfortunately, from an oncologic point of view, it is uncertain whether his platelet count will reach at least 100,000 in order to give this man therapy.  As a potential other therapy, we will discuss the ability of radiation oncology to increase the number of cGy to that local area considering he only received 30 at the onset.

Chief Complaint:  diarrhea

History of Present Illness:  
77-year-old gentleman with Stage IIIB diffuse large B-cell lymphoma s/p 4 cycles of CHOP-R with increased PET avidity of left groin nodal mass and biopsy c/w DLBCL then s/p R-ICE cycle #2. Now s/p 40 gray XRT to limited recurrence site in left groin. He was hospitalized recently for neutropenia and fevers, received cefepime and vancomycin, and was discharged on 2/2/2098.  As per d/c summary, he received cefepime for E. coli and VRE UTI (though this is a little confusing since urine culture negative that admission, and positive for these organisms in 11/2097).  During most recent admission he was found to be C. diff positive, but appears to have had incomplete course of Flagyl.  Since discharge, patient reports    not feeling the same.     He has had crampy abdominal pain, diarrhea, and experienced some lightheadedness this morning.

ONC history - as per prior notes
3/97: Mr. Nielson was in his usual state of health until he presented with LLE edema and bilateral groin swelling, left>right.
4/97: CT scan of the abdomen revealed retroperitoneal adenopathy. CT scan of the pelvis revealed a chain of retrocrural nodes in front of the aorta and vena cava as well as bulky adenopathy in the external iliac chain with an iliac mass measuring 3.0 to 3.5 cm in diameter on the left side.  The largest node in the inguinal area measured approximately 6.0 cm.  
4/18/97: biopsy of left groin mass c/w DLBCL. CD20+, CD 79a+, Pax5+, CD30-, CD15- 
4/97: PET: Increased FDG uptake throughout the retroperitoneum, left pelvis and proximal left lower extremity which corresponds with extensive lymphadenopathy.
4/24/97: Bone Marrow Biopsy: without evidence of involvement
5/01/97 Cycle #1 of CHOP-R at 75% Adria and Cytoxan dose
5/22/97 Cycle #2 of CHOP-R at 100% Adria and Cytoxan dose - Neulasta
6/5/97: PET: Interval enlargement of left groin mass but less intense FDG uptake. Enlargement in size may represent necrosis from treatment effect. Improvement in left iliac adenopathy and resolution of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Small pancreatic body cystic lesion - may be IPMT. 
6/12/97: Cycle #3 of CHOP-R at 100% Adria and Cytoxan dose - Neulasta

Patient Name: LILLY, LARRY;  MRN: 2155941
Dictated on: 11/20/2071 by ANDRE-ISRAEL SANTIAGO, M.D. 

 
DIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral, right greater than left, carpal tunnel syndrome.  
 
HISTORY:  This is a first office visit for this 77-year-old, right-hand-dominant, founder of Bed Bath and Beyond, who comes for evaluation of right greater than left hand and wrist pain.  The patient reports having a longstanding history of greater than four months of worsening pain, paresthesias, and ""numbness"" on the right worse than left hand.  This is worse at night and does occasionally wake him up from sleep.  Also bothers him during prolonged activity.  He also reports recently over the past few months noting difficulty with the key pinch, grasp, and fine motor function.  Previous evaluation consisted of cervical spine MRI as well as EMG nerve conduction studies demonstrating findings significant for severe compression neuropathy of the median nerve at the level of wrist.  He now comes for evaluation for potential carpal tunnel surgery release.   
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Glucose intolerance, history of previous CVA, status post CABG, hypertension, GER.   
MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor, Zocor, Ecotrin, Effexor, and Nexium.  
 
ALLERGIES:  None.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, he is very pleasant, well appearing in no apparent distress.  
Examination of the right hand demonstrates marked thenar atrophy.  There is no active abductor pollicis brevis and 
very weak opponens.  He has a positive Tinel's, positive Phalen's, and positive median nerve compression test at the wrist.  His interossei and extensors are full.  Sensation is intact throughout.  
 
EMG studies from 11/09/2071, performed here at Folsom Convalescent Hospital, significant for right worse than left median nerve compression neuropathy at the wrists.   
IMPRESSION:  The patient is seen and examined with Dr. Santiago.  At this time, we feel that Larry has indeed a significant, right worse than left, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.  Given the amount of weakness and thenar wasting, he has difficulty with abductor pollicis, we have recommended proceeding with both carpal tunnel release as well as 
possible FTS of ring finger to thumb tendon transfer.  We discussed with Larry the risks and benefits of this procedure and he is in agreement of the plan.  We will try to schedule him to proceed with surgery at some point in the near future.  We filled out both history and physical, as well as a surgical consent form today in the office.

Reason for visit   Annual examination.



History of present illness   The patient has done very well over the last year.  He has maintained his weight, which has been quite difficult given the social commitments that he has.  He is requiring to eat out quite a bit.  He has also done a large amount of traveling over the last three to four months.  This caused him to be more exhausted than usual.  His incarcerated hernia repair has stood up.  He has some discomfort occasionally in that area, but for the most part feels that this is back to normal.  He is careful with his diet as much as he can be.  He had a cold over the last month or so.  It slowly resolved.  He is asymptomatic presently.

Assessment and plan   The patient is generally doing well.  His cardiac risk management is doing fine.  His blood pressure is in good control.  His recent cholesterol profile is excellent.  He has slightly elevated fasting blood sugars.  We discussed options including diet and exercise which I think he has been very good on.  Discussed starting metformin based on recent data that this may help prevent his development of diabetes.  We will begin metformin 500 mg PO QD.  We will check his renal and liver function in one week and his bruising is likely due to his aspirin.  We need to follow up on a renal ultrasound for cysts that were discovered during his hernia operation, and I will make these arrangements.  The patient is to return to clinic in three months     Coronary artery diseas



Selected recent labs   We reviewed his laboratories.  These were done earlier in the week.

   Mr.  Lilly is now 81 years old and it has been six and half years since his coronary bypass procedure.  Since I saw him last six months ago, he has generally done well.  He has not had any angina.  No dyspnea, orthopnea, lightheadedness, dizziness, palpitations, or syncope.  He has reduced his exercise to three days a week-he exercises vigorously when he does exercise, but this seems to give him a little bit more in the way of stamina.

RE:  Urania Yerger

     MR #583-48-90-0

 

Dear Dr. Dillon:

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today for the first

time in Titonka Care Center in follow-up of her

coronary artery disease and coronary artery bypass grafting in

October of this year.  Though you know her history well, I will

recount it for the purposes of record keeping.  Ms. Yerger is

presently 81 years old.  Her vascular risk factors include

diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia.  She had no prior diagnosis

of coronary disease until she presented in early October with flash

pulmonary edema after which she ruled in for a small non-ST

elevation myocardial infarction.  Coronary angiography at the

Titonka revealed complex diffuse disease of the proximal LAD,

thrombotic lesion of the proximal circumflex with subsequent

complete occlusion and a complex lesion of the first large marginal

as well as a 70% osteal stenosis of a large PLV.  Angiography also

revealed a 90% left renal artery stenosis.  The patient underwent

subsequent successful stenting of her right renal artery followed

by coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. Susan Abreu.  (SVG to

ramus, OM2, RCA, and LIMA to LAD).  Ms. Yerger's postoperative

course was notable for persistent pleural effusion and transient

episode of atrial fibrillation.  

 

Since her discharge, she has been slowly increasing her level of

activity experiencing mild dyspnea on exertion while on extending

shopping trips.  Overall, these symptoms have continued to improve. 

She denies orthopnea, PND, or shortness of breath at rest.  She has

had persistent mild ankle edema on the site of her saphenous vein

graft harvesting.  She denies palpitations, presyncope, TIA, CVA

symptoms or claudication.  

 

Detailed review of all other pertinent systems is negative.  Ms.

Yerger tells me that she has recently had an erythematous rash on

her upper and lower extremities that you have been managing as a

possible viral exanthem.  

Yerger, Urania

MR #583-48-90-0               -2-            December 14, 2078

 

Past medical history is notable for chronic renal insufficiency

(baseline creatinine 2), vascular risk factors as delineated and

prior right knee replacement.  

 

Her current medications include enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q.

day, Lasix 40 mg po q. day, Glipizide 10 mg po q. day, Lisinopril

5 mg po q. day, Lopressor 25 mg po t.i.d., atorvastatin 10 mg po q.

day, Avandia, multivitamins, Protonix and Nystatin cream.

 

Social History:  The patient lives alone but has many family

members in the area.  She is currently staying with her daughter. 

At baseline, she has been able to ambulate slowly with a cane but

is limited by chronic knee pain.  She denies alcohol or tobacco

use.  Her father died of a myocardial infarction at age 60.

 

On physical exam, Ms. Yerger looks extremely well today.  She is

comfortable seated on the exam table.  Her skin is warm and dry. 

She has a diffuse erythematous macular papular rash predominantly

on her extremities.  Her blood pressure is 140/80, her heart rate

is in the 70's.  She has no jugular venous distention.  Her

carotids are 2+ without bruits.  Her chest reveals decreased breath

sounds at the left base.  There are no crackles or wheezes. 

Cardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and

rhythm, S1, S2 and S4 is present and P2 is slightly increased. 

There was a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur radiating toward the

apex.  Her abdomen is soft and nontender.  Her extremities are free

of cyanosis or clubbing.  Distal pulses are 1+.  She has mild edema

of the left lower extremity.

 

Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm 79 beats per minute, normal axis and

intervals, persistent deep anterior T wave inversions.

 

Overall, Ms. Yerger continues on a steady course of recovery after

her non-ST elevation MI and coronary artery bypass grafting in mid

October.  Her persistent dyspnea on exertion may be related to

persistent pleural effusion.  We will reevaluate today with a

repeat chest x-ray.  In the meantime, I think that we should

continue her oral diuretic regimen.  It is possible that her

persistent rash is related to her Lasix.  Although not certain to

be successful, we have made a change to Bumex 1 mg po q. day today

in the hopes that if Lasix is responsible for her rash this may

resolve.  I have made no other changes to her medical regimen.  We

will continue aspirin, beta blockade, ACE inhibition and statin for

secondary prevention.  I look forward to seeing her again in

approximately eight to twelve weeks.  In addition, she will follow-

up with Dr. Abreu for possible thoracentesis if she has a

persistent pleural effusion that may be contributing to her

symptoms.

RE:  Urania Yerger
     MR #583-48-90-0

Dear Dr. Dillon:

I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today in Titonka Care Center in
follow-up of her coronary artery disease (CABG 10/78) and heart failure.  At her last visit her
heart failure had improved, but she still was hypertensive.  We increased both her Losartan and
her Toprol dosing.  Today her blood pressure is substantially improved.  She has generally been
feeling well.  She has continued to walk outside the home with her daughters, going shopping. 
She denies orthopnea or PND.  She has had stable ankle edema.  

Her current medications are aspirin 325 mg PO q. day, Lasix 40 mg PO q. day, Glipizide 10 mg
PO q. day, Losartan 100 mg PO q. day, Toprol XL 100 mg PO q. day, Simvastatin 10 mg PO q.
day, Avandia, and multivitamins.

On physical examination, her blood pressure today is 130/60.  Her heart rate is in the high 60s. 
She is comfortable seated on the examination table.  Her jugular venous pressure is less than 8. 
Her chest examination has a few coarse crackles at the bases.  Cardiac examination reveals a
non-displaced PMI with normal intensity S1 and S2.  She has a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur
at the apex and a grade II crescendo/decrescendo systolic murmur at the right upper sternal
border.  She has 1 - 2+ edema of both lower extremities and they are warm to touch.

Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm at 68 beats per minute, normal axis and intervals.  There are
nonspecific ST abnormalities.

Overall, Ms. Yerger has improved significantly with better control of her blood pressure.  She
has signs of very mild volume overload on examination, with preserved perfusion.  We elected
to maintain her present dosing, but discussed increasing her dose to 40 mg PO q. a.m. and 20 mg
PO q. p.m. should her lower extremity edema increase or her weight rise.

Dear Dr. Dillon:



I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today in Titonka Care Center in followup of her coronary artery disease (CABG in October 2078), hypertension, and heart failure.  Since increasing her Lasix dose approximately 12 months ago, she has had substantial improvement in her heart failure symptoms.  She continues to admit to fatigue and musculoskeletal pain as limiting her exertion, but no longer experiences significant dyspnea.  She denies orthopnea, PND, or ankle edema.



Her current medications are aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., Lasix 60 mg p.o. q.d., glipizide 10 mg p.o. q.d., losartan 100 mg p.o. q.d., Toprol-XL 100 mg p.o. q.d., simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.d., Avandia, and multivitamins.



Her blood pressure today is 165/70 and her heart rate is in the low 60s.  She is comfortable seated on the exam table.  Her jugular venous pressure is approximately 8 cm with prominent V waves.  There are very rare crackles at the bases.  Cardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and rhythm, normal intensity S1 and S2.  P2 is increased.  There is a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur, loudest at the apex.  She has no edema of the extremities and they are warm to touch.



Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm with normal axis intervals.  There is nonspecific ST abnormality, unchanged from her tracing in August.



In summary, Ms. Yerger remains free of recurrent angina or heart failure symptoms.  She does have evident persistent elevated right cardiac pressures on exam that may be related to her underlying pulmonary disease.  In light of her systolic hypertension, we increased her Toprol to 150 mg p.o. q.d.  She will have her blood pressure checked in the coming week and call the result to me.



I look forward to seeing her again in approximately six months.  It remains a pleasure being involved in this delightful woman's care.



Sincerely yours,

Infectious Disease Fellow Consult Note



Patient Name:  Yerger, Urania

MRN:  58348900

HPI:  Ms. Yerger is an 84 yo F with CAD, DM, CHF, Htn, HL, and right ankle fracture s/p ORIF on 11/04/81 who presents with poor healing over the medial malleolus; we were consulted by Dr. Felton for recommendations on antibiotic management.   



She was initially seen on 11/01/81 after a mechanical fall which resulted in comminuted bimalleolar ankle fracture for which she underwent ORIF on 11/04/81.  She had follow-up with her orthopaedist on 1/15/81 at which time she was noted to have an eschar with poor wound healing around the medial malleolus.  She was therefore admitted yesterday for I&D of the open lesion on her ankle, as well as hardware removal.  There is no operative report from the procedure.  Reportedly there was non-union of the fracture, so hardware was removed.  Tissue appeared fairly healthy.   

 

She denies having any recent fevers, chills, night sweats, or particular pain in the ankle.  She has been doing some weight bearing with use of a walker.  She has had some mild serous drainage from the ankle, but no purulent drainage.

Impression/Recommendations: 84 yo F with CAD, DM, CHF, Htn, HL, and right ankle fracture s/p ORIF on 11/04/81 who presents with poor healing over the medial malleolus, now s/p I&D of the open medial malleolus wound; we were consulted by Dr. Felton for recommendations on antibiotic management.   



The extent of infection is a surgical diagnosis.  If the swabs were obtained from the superficial wound, then this may represent merely a wound infection which requires 2 weeks of antibiotics.  However if the infection was felt on surgical inspection to extend to the region of the removed hardware, then this represents osteomyelitis by definition, and she will need 6 weeks of IV antibiotics with consideration of the removal of the remaining hardware.  



After discussion with the ortho resident, it seems that the culture was obtained from the site of screw removal.  Thus, we have to assume hardware infection with concomitant osteomyelitis.  Thus 6 weeks of IV antibiotics is necessary.  We cannot rule out infection of the remaining hardware, however I understand the reluctance to remove the remainder of the hardware by the ortho service.  Thus would pursue 6 week course of therapy, then monitor closely for signs of failure. 



1.	Continue vancomycin until susceptibilities are available; will determine whether the addition of rifampin in necessary given retained hardware based on susceptibility results

2.     Please obtain vanc trough prior to 3rd dose

3.     Please obtain LFTs

 

Patient seen and examined with ID Attending, Dr. Ulysses Xayasane.  

We will continue to follow along with you.  Thank you for the consult.

RE:  Kathy Joshi
     ILC #158-42-11-2
 
Dear Dr. Taylor:
 
Mrs. Joshi returns after a one year hiatus.  She continues to
complain of rare retrosternal chest discomfort only occasionally
secondary to exertion.  These episodes occur on a roughly once a
month basis lasting anywhere from seconds to several minutes. 
Addition of long acting nitrates to her medical regimen has had no
effect on the frequency or severity of this syndrome and she does
not take Nitroglycerin for it.  A stress test performed last
January showed Mrs. Joshi exercising for 4 minutes and 30 seconds
of a Bruce protocol stopping at a peak heart rate of 119, peak
blood pressure of 150/70 secondary to dyspnea.  She had no ischemic
EKG changes noted, however, a simultaneously obtained Sesta-MIBI
scan revealed a minor fixed anterior wall defect as well as a small
surrounding area of transient ischemia.  In addition, there was a
moderately severe fixed inferior wall defect again with peri-
infarct mild ischemia.  Of note, her last serum cholesterol was 266
with an HDL of 52 and an LDL of 192. 
 
She remains on a regimen of Isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg p.o. q.d.,
aspirin 1 tab p.o. q.d, Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., NPH 12 units
S.C. q a.m. with 6 units CZI S.C. q a.m., and 15 units NPH S.C. q
p.m.. 
 
Physical exam reveals a well nourished, overweight woman in no
acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 160/90, heart
rate 67 and regular, respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 264
pounds, which is six pounds above her weight of one year ago.  The
neck is supple.  JVP flat.  Carotids are 2 + without bruits.  Chest
 
                             Page 2
 
Kathy Joshi
ILC #158-42-11-2

remains clear.  Cardiac exam reveals normal S1, physiologically
split S2 and a soft I/VI systolic ejection murmur.  The abdomen is
benign.  Extremities without appreciable edema.  
 
Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 67, P-R interval
.22, QRS .10, Q-T .36, axis 20 degrees.  There are isolated atrial
premature depolarizations noted along with first degree AV block
and a prior inferior posterior myocardial infarction with minor
nonspecific ST and T wave changes.  Compared to his last
electrocardiogram there has been no significant change.
 
Impression:  Mrs. Joshi continues to have evidence of mild, stable
angina.  I have asked her to begin Simvastatin at 20 mg p.o. q h.s.
for her significant hyperlipidemia and I strongly encouraged her to
more aggressively try to lower her caloric intake and increase her
aerobic activity level.  In addition, I have asked her to obtain
her blood pressure at least two or three more times on an
ambulatory basis and told her that if she remained reliably above
140/85 then I would consider initiating pharmacologic
antihypertensive therapy.  In addition, as long as she remains
active and asymptomatic, I will plan on repeating her exercise MIBI
stress test in one to one and a half years time.  Beyond this I
have not altered her present regimen. 
 
Of course, I thank you for allowing me to assist in her care.
 
Respectfully yours,

Dear Dr. Taylor:

 

Mrs. Joshi returns for followup.  Currently, she complains of

exertional fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and mild peripheral

edema.  Since last seen, she has continued to find it quite

difficult to lose weight, and has thus far declined seeing

members of our obesity clinic.  As you know, in the past, she

also has declined any consideration of attempted cardioversion or

other invasive studies.  Presently, she remains on a regimen of

enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., simvastatin 20 mg p.o.

q.d., metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., isosorbide nitrate 60 mg p.o.

q.d., Avapro 150 mg p.o. q.d., Actos 45 mg p.o. q.d., potassium,

10 mEq p.o. q.d. Pumex 2 mg p.o. q.d., Coumadin, magnesium oxide,

Humulin insulin 20 units subcutaneous q. a.m. along with 50 units

subcutaneous q. p.m., and Humalog 26 units subcutaneous q. a.m.

 

Physical examination reveals a markedly overweight woman in no

acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting at 106/62,

heart rate 65 and irregularly regular, respirations 16 and

unlabored, weight 306 lbs, which is 6 lbs above her weight 10

months ago.  The neck is soft.  JVP is flat.  Carotids without

significant bruits.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam reveals a

normal S1, a physiologically split S2, with a1-2/6 systolic

murmur radiating from apex to the base.  No significant diastolic

murmur or rub.  The abdomen is obese, but otherwise benign.

Extremities reveal 1-2+ bipedal edema, peripheral pulses are

intact albeit mildly diminished.

 

Electrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation with a variable QRS

response.  The P waves are more organized than one might usually

see, suggesting the possibility of fibrillation/flutter as well. 

QRS 0.11, QT 0.38, axis 90 degrees, there is evidence of a prior

inferior myocardial infarction.  Compared with his last

electrocardiogram, there is no significant change.

 

Impression:  Mrs. Joshy continues to suffer from morbid obesity,

and I had a long discussion with her and her daughter regarding

the essential nature of her engaging in an aggressive weigh

reduction program.  I once again have strongly encouraged her to

make an appointment with our obesity clinic to assist in

extensive weight reduction.  I also discussed with her my

concerns regarding her symptoms of slowly progressive peripheral

edema, particularly as it pertains both to her weight, and atrial

or tachyarrhythmias.  As in the past, she told me that she would

refuse any consideration for attempted cardioversion or other

studies.  She did, however, agree to continue with her current

medical regimen.  I obtained routine blood studies today to

verify the adequacy of her lipid control and diabetes management.

 I have introduced her to Hayden Nutter, her nurse practitioner, who

will assist in trying to achieve a little more diuresis overt he

next few weeks.  We have given her a prescription for Zaroxylyn

to begin at 2.5 mg p.o. q.d., which will help result in some

degree of mild diuresis.  Nonetheless, she understands that

significant weight loss can only occur through a weight reduction

program.  I have of course explained to her the increased cardiac

morbidity associated with her current lifestyle.  Beyond this, I

have not altered her current medical regimen.

 

Of course, I thank you for allowing me to assist in his care.

 

Sincerely yours,

EDVISIT^15842112^Joshi, Kathy^07/20/71^KATZ, LAURA

This patient was seen, interviewed, and examined by myself

primarily.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old female who

presents with body swelling and shortness of breath.  The patient

is unable to say when she specifically noted her lower extremity

swelling.  She states that approximately 1 year prior to arrival

she had to throw out all of her shoes except for 2 pairs because

all those shoes had become tight.  At the present time, the

patient is only able to wear sandals and apparently her

co-workers noted her to be significantly swollen and suggested

that she see a physician.  The patient states that there was no

acute change in her swelling today.  She states that she has had

a cough for 1 month.  Again, there was no acute change.  Today,

she denies any chest pain at any time.  She does complain of

dyspnea and specifically dyspnea on exertion, no PND, no

orthopnea, and no change in her overall energy level.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  MI, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes

mellitus.

MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin, aspirin, insulin, Lasix, and Avapro. 

Otherwise as per the written note.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Significant for no tobacco use, no alcohol use. 

The patient works as an animal trainer.  She lives with family.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies fevers or chills, chest pain or

palpitations, abdominal pain, or dark stools.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a well-developed, well-nourished

female, edematous.  Temperature 100.9, pulse 97, respiratory rate

of 22, blood pressure is 178/64, and oxygen saturation is 89% on

room air and 94% on 2 L nasal cannula.  HEENT is normocephalic

and atraumatic.  Moist mucous membranes.  Extraocular motions are

intact.  Sclerae are anicteric.  Neck is supple.  Full range of

motion.  JVD is difficult to assess due to the patient's body

habitus.  Lungs:  Positive crackles in the lower 1/4 of the lung

field bilaterally.  There is no dullness to percussion.  Cardiac:

 Irregularly regular, not tachycardic, no murmur is auscultated. 

Rectal:  Heme-negative stool.  Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds,

soft, distended, no fluid wave, no hepatomegaly is palpated but

palpation is somewhat limited by the patient's body habitus. 

Skin is warm, dry, and intact.  There are various ecchymotic

lesions on the extremities.  Extremities:  2+ edema of the

bilateral lower extremities in the mid thighs.  Neurologic: 

Alert and oriented x3.  Follows all commands appropriate.  Short

and long-term memories are intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  Significant for a chest x-ray which has a

right-sided pleural effusion and increased pulmonary vasculature

as well as stable cardiomegaly.  Glucose of 223, BUN of 31, a

creatinine of 1.2, bicarbonate of 24, CK of 87, BNP of 2570, MB

of 0.9, and troponin which is less than assay.  White count of

5.1, hematocrit of 34.2, and platelets of 124,000.  INR of 4.6.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was seen, interviewed,

and examined in the Emergency Department with labs and studies

obtained as documented above.  Her past medical records were

reviewed.  The patient is in congestive heart failure.  She

received Lasix and lisinopril as well as aspirin while in the

Emergency Department and she has been diuresing appropriately

after receiving the Lasix.  She has been supplemented with oxygen

by nasal cannula.  The source of her fever is not clear.  She

will need to have a repeat chest x-ray as her pulmonary edema

evidence of cellulitis.  UA is pending.  The patient also needs

serial cardiac enzymes and an echocardiogram but this will be

handled by the inpatient department.  I did speak with the patient's

cardiologist and she will be admitted to the Cardiology Service.

DIAGNOSIS:  Congestive heart failure.

DISPOSITION:  The patient is admitted in satisfactory condition.

Benjamin W. Taylor, M.D.

Illini Community Hospital

Three Rivers, NM  11424



Dear Dr. Taylor:



Mrs. Joshi returns to the office for routine followup.  Since last seen, she apparently was without evidence of increasing BUN and creatinine and for this reason was advised to transiently hold both her lisinopril and Zaroxolyn.  By doing so, her creatinine fell from 2.2 to 1.6 and BUN from 117 to 57.  She subsequently has resumed her lisinopril therapy, as apparently her blood pressure increased off her ACE inhibitor.  In addition, as part of her followup last March, she underwent an adenosine MIBI stress test during which time she achieved a peak heart rate of 65, peak blood pressure of 129/50, stopping because she reached the end of the adenosine infusion protocol.  Her gated SPECT imaging demonstrated a global left ventricular ejection fraction of 38% with a mildly dilated left ventricle and akinesis of the basal inferoseptal and entire inferior wall.  Her rest-stress perfusion imaging showed similarly a large fixed perfusion defect in the inferior and basal inferoseptal wall without any area of reversible ischemia.  Her last echocardiogram performed in July 2071 showed a residual of left ventricular ejection fraction mildly reduced at 45% with severe inferoseptal and inferior hypokinesis.  In addition, at that time showed evidence for trivial mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and her echo was essentially unchanged from her prior study in March 2071.



Currently, she is concerned primarily about her inability to lose weight, and in fact states that during a recent vacation she actually discontinued her diet.  Presently, she continues on a regimen of Toprol-XL 37.5 mg p.o. daily, simvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily, lisinopril 5 mg p.o. daily, potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d., furosemide 160 mg p.o. b.i.d., Coumadin, enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily, Niferex 150 mg p.o. daily, Humulin N 20 units subcutaneous q.a.m. and Humulin N 20 units subcutaneous q.p.m.



Physical exam reveals a pleasant, mildly overweight woman in no acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 120/52, heart rate 45 and irregularly regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight 253 pounds, which is 12 pounds above her weight of six months ago.  The neck is supple.  JVP is flat.  Carotids are without significant bruits.  Chest remains clear.  Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with a soft systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base.  No significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is overweight, but otherwise benign without evidence of abdominal aneurysm or bruit.  Extremities reveal trace bipedal edema.  Peripheral pulses are detectable, albeit mildly diminished.



Electrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation flutter with at times of significant AV block with pauses as high as approximately 2 seconds.  There is evidence of a prior inferior myocardial infarction and minor nonspecific ST and T-wave changes.  Compared with her last electrocardiogram, her heart rate at times is slower.



Impression:  Ms. Joshi remains stable from a cardiovascular perspective, however, I am obviously concerned about her potential for lightheadedness in light of her bradycardia.  I have asked her to decrease her Toprol-XL to 25 mg p.o. daily and to repeat an EKG four to five days after doing so.  I of course have reminded her as to the importance of getting in contact with you or myself straight away should she develop any symptoms suggestive of lightheadedness or dizziness.  She understands that she may require a permanent pacemaker in the future.  Most recent blood studies show a significantly elevated glucose of 183 (she states she is trying to tailor her insulin regimen with you) and in January, normal liver function studies except for an alkaline phosphatase of 304 and lipid profile last September notable for a cholesterol of 134, triglyceride of 74, HDL 58, and LDL 61.  She understands the importance of continuing to adhere to a low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet while remaining on her antilipemic therapy.  She will discuss with you and her nephrologist the optimal management of her mild renal insufficiency.  In light of both her diabetes and coronary disease, it certainly would be optimal if possible to continue her on her ACE inhibitor.  At the present time, she does not meet criteria for prophylactic placement of an AICD and her New York Heart Association class I to II status precludes the need for consideration of biventricular pacing.  Other than reducing her beta-blocker regimen as described above, I have not further altered her current medical program.



I thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.



Sincerely yours,







Brandon W Neilson, M.D.

Conner, Andrew
MR #9911852
May 18, 2071

Andy comes in for followup of hospitalization on May 6, for coronary artery disease and he had
increasing angina pectoris leading to catheterization.  He underwent angioplasty of the
circumflex vessels and then angioplasty and stenting of the first diagonal branch to the LAD. 
The latter one was done in the second setting and part of the study where the ____ the stent
versus a plain stent.  This was done by Dr. Winn, and Dr. Cook.  Since then he has been
tired, otherwise felt well.  He had reasonable lipids but low HDL syndrome.  His blood sugars
have been controlled recently with A1C's in the 6 range.  He is overweight and does not do any
regular exercise program.  He is on        for arthritis.  

His current medications consist of aspirin 325 mg per day, Plavix 75 mg per day, Glucatrol 10
mg twice daily and Glucophage 500 mg twice daily, Atenolol 25 mg daily, Nexium 20 mg per
day, Flomax .4 and Zestril. He feels well.  He is a little fatigued.  No obvious angina.  His blood
pressure is running 110/70, his pulse is running 60 and regular.  JVP is normal. Carotids are
normal.  The lungs are clear.  Coronary:  S3.

IMPRESSION:  Doing well.  I think he should probably be on Lipitor even though he is on low
lipids and I also think that he would benefit from cardiac rehabilitation. He will also pay close
attention to diabetes and he is prepared to move on with insulin.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mr. Noonan is a 69-year-old man who has type
II insulin-requiring diabetes, obesity, hypertension,
dyslipidemia, chronic atrial fibrillation, degenerative
osteoarthritis and diabetic neuropathy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He comes today complaining of one
week with mild chest pain not irradiated to the head, to jaw or
the arm, but with very mild shortness of breath.  He denies
nausea, vomiting or sweatiness.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Protonix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d., verapamil SR
190 mg q.d., Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d., Neurontin 900 mg in the
morning 900 mg at noon and 300 mg at night, Lipitor 10 mg q.d.,
Zestril 10 mg q.d., Glucophage 1000 mg twice a day, and 75/25
insulin 40 units in the morning and 40 in the evening, Tylenol
with Codeine p.r.n. for severe pain and Coumadin 3 mg alternating
with 4.5 mg.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The blood pressure today is 120/88 and his
weight is 256 pounds.  The examination of the neck with no lymph
nodes.  He is oriented and in no acute distress.  The cardiac
examination with arrhythmia consistent with atrial fibrillation. 
The lungs with hypoventilation in both bases and no evidence of
acute congestive heart failure.  He has edema that has been
chronic in both extremities.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Review of an EKG obtained in August of this
year showed atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular or
apparently conducted complexes, nonspecific T-wave abnormality
probably digitalis effect, abnormal EKG that when compared to the
one in June showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities that were not
evident at that time and now present in anterior leads.

I have talked to people in the emergency department and he is
being sent right now for an evaluation of possible angina.

This patient was seen on 10/01/2082 with the resident, Dr.

Jacob.  Please see her note for details.  The resident's

history and physical examination were reviewed and confirmed. 

Please see her note for details.  The plan of care and

disposition of the patient were discussed with the resident.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 70-year-old male who presents with two

weeks of back pain radiating from the mid back to the chest.  He

also has pain in his left leg up to his flank.  He also has some

scrotal swelling and lower abdominal pain.  The pain has been

intermittent and the patient has been taking Vicodin for the past

two days.  The pain that he has been having is actually chronic,

except for the left-sided flank pain and the chest pain.  He was

found on the ground by his daughter, and it was unclear to the

patient how he ended up in that position.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for myocardial infarction,

atrial fibrillation, diabetes, cerebrovascular accident, low back

pain, sciatica, Bell palsy, reflux, osteochondritis, peripheral

vascular disease, and diabetic neuropathy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is afebrile, heart rate 80,

respirations 16, blood pressure 126/82, and oxygen saturation is

100%.  He is in severe distress.  His lung exam is normal.  His

cardiac examination shows no abnormality.  His abdomen is

distended, and there is tenderness to palpation in the left lower

quadrant, and there is CVA tenderness in the left flank.  There

is also significant pain on movement of his left leg either

passively or actively.  It is not possible for us to evaluate the

strength in his left hip or knee because of pain.  He is alert

and oriented to person, place, time, and event.  His cranial

nerves are intact.  Rectal examination shows mildly decreased

sphincter tone, but no evidence of saddle anesthesia.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  Show a CK of 128 with MB fraction of 3.8,

and troponin I is less than assay.  INR is 2.8.  UA shows 0 to 1

white blood cells and 1 to 2 red blood cells.  Electrocardiogram

shows atrial fibrillation with bradycardic rate of 47.  His head

CT shows no abnormality.  There is stranding around his left

kidney.  The aorta appears normal.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was given an aspirin

325 mg p.o. and morphine 4 mg IV for pain.  His pain improved

significantly.  However, he had another recurrence of the pain

and with rising discomfort.  It was decided to admit the patient

to the hospital for management of his pain and further workup to

This patient was seen with Dr. Ussery.  I confirm that I have

interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's

documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the

evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old male with a

history of cough and pleuritic type chest pain.  The patient

denies any nausea or vomiting.  He does have history of MI as

well as multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease.  He

also reports lower extremities swelling worse than usual, and has

left greater than right edema at baseline due to a reconstructive

surgery following motor vehicle collision.  Of note, the

patient's medications include Coumadin, which he is on for atrial

fibrillation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake, alert, and in no

distress.  His vital signs show heart rate of 70, respiratory

rate of 24, blood pressure 112/72, and oxygen saturation 96% on

room air and 98% on 2 liters.  His lungs are clear and heart is

irregularly irregular.  This is somewhat limited due to body

habitus.  The abdomen is soft and there is a chronic left upper

quadrant tenderness.  The back shows left CVA tenderness.

LABORATORY DATA:  The laboratory analysis shows a hematocrit of

42.1 and a white blood cell count of 7.6.  Cardiac biomarkers are

negative, and the troponin is less than 0.1.  A d-dimer is less

than 200.  The INR is 1.7.  UA is pending.  ECG shows an atrial

fibrillation with some nonspecific T-wave changes in leads V3

through V6.

IMAGING STUDIES:  A chest radiograph was a markedly limited due

to patient's habitus.

DECISION MAKING AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  There was no

clear etiology to the patient's shortness of breath.  Given his

anticoagulation and a negative d-dimer, we feel that this is

unlikely to be PE.  It is clearly possible to be cardiac, given

the history of coronary artery disease and a slightly abnormal

electrocardiogram.  This may be pneumonia, and the chest x-ray is

not terribly helpful.  We are obtaining a CT scan of the chest

without IV contrast to better delineate the pulmonary

architecture, and are admitting the patient to the Medicine

Service for monitoring and cycling of enzymes and ECGs.

DIAGNOSES:

1.  Shortness of breath.

2.  T-wave inversions on electrocardiogram.

HPI: 76 year old Spanish speaking male with numerous medical problems (IDDM, Afib, HTN, PVD, Cr baseline 1.7, no prior HF,, normal echo 2085, normal MIBI 2085) who was just dishcharged 28 days ago for LE edema admission, who complains of 3 weeks of sore throat. He states that because of this he has suffered from a gradual dyspnea, complicated by orthopnea and PND for two days.  He states he has left sided pleuritic chest pain worse with inspiration.  He states he also has noticed increased baseline LE edema for 2 weeks, but denies and increase in abdominal girth.  He states he decided to seek medical treatment for his gradual onset shortness of breath.


The patient states he has been taking all of his medications and has not increased the sodium in his diet recently.  He denies fever, chills, dysuria, asymettric leg swelling, or any palpable blood vessels in his legs.


Of note the patient is on 80 mg BID of lasix for his LE edema though his most recent echo, 2085, shows a normal EF and the patient has no history of CHF.

HPI

51 yo F with MMP comes to establish primary care as she is unhappy with the cre she is geting at CityMemorial. She was 40 mislate to her appt and time was limited. She has multiple medical problems for which she is on a variety of medications, none o which she has taken x1 month as she ran out of refills.



1. CVA-She reports 3-4 mos ago she had a stroke (she was told there was a clot in her brain) which left the L side of her face paralyzed and some residual weakness in her LUE. She also notes her handwriting has completely changed since. Since the stroke she has had multiple episodes during which her tongue becomes very heavy and she has difficulty speaking (distinctly different from her now mildly imapired baseline) At these times she feel somewhat confused and her L vison seems blurry. This has happened 4-5 times and lasts all day. er family has encouraged her to seek medical care but she has refused bc she did not think they would do antyhing for her. Of note, pt has not been on ASA as it was d/cd when she changed to celebrex. Pt also c/o memory loss that started even before the CVA.



2. CAD-She reports a h/o multiple MIs, incl cardiac cath x2, unknown if she had intevention, she thinks the last was about 1 yr ago. She has stable 3 pillow orthopnea. She becomes SOB when she climbs 5 steps and gets SOB sometimes when she walks, which resolves ith rest, but she is able to walk a fair amt still (cannot pin down how much).  She denies CP with exertion, did have CP with her MIs. She says smx she has lower and upper extremity edema. She has not had a recent ETT.



3. DM-Pt has been on glucophage and Humulin 70/30 100U in am and 60 in pm, but has not been monitoring her BS or taking insulin for the past month. She has all the necessary equipment. She says she tries o monior her carb intake. She has been gaining weight, bout 5 lbs in the past 2 mos, and notes polydypsia and polyuria fo the past 2 weeks.



4. HTN-has not been taking Zestoretic or Atenolol x1 mo



5. Depression-Pt has h/o depression for which she has been medicated in the past. She currently feels she has very depressed mood, apathy, trouble sleeping and with memory tasks. She denies SI/HI/AH.



6. In terms of health maintenance, her last PAP was 2 yrs ago as was her last Mammo. Her last HgA1C is fr 199 as are her lipids.

Patient: Klein, Michelle

MRN:	2474410

Date: 	2/6/50

Time: 	10:00 p.m.

PCP:	Whitney Keller, M.D.



Reason for consult: garbled speech



HPI:   Patient is a 74 yo RH woman with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p LAD stent (2144) who was in her USOH until this afternoon at 12:15 p.m. when she experienced sudden onset of garbled speech and difficulty ""expressing myself"" while cooking lunch for she and her husband.  This episode was accompanied shortly thereafter by a dull, L fronto-temporal headache that persisted for several hours.  She states she did not have word-finding difficulties but simply had trouble articulating herself.   The episode came on suddenly and lasted 1-2 hours before she resolved back to baseline.  In addition to headache, associated symptoms included generalized weakness, feeling cold and mildly nauseated.  She denied visual changes, chest pain, sob, palpitations, lightheadedness, vertigo, difficulty with swallowing, coordination or gait.  She describes having a glass of orange juice with the thought that her sugar might be low, without apparent effect.



She recalls one similar episode ~ 2 years ago at which time she had her husband drive her home and she went to bed.  The speech difficulty had resolved by morning, and she apparently never told her physician or had any further work-up.  She has no known history of seizures.  Migraines occur 1-2x/year, preceeded by scintillating scotoma, associated with nausea, photophobia, relieved by sleep.  No recent fevers, chills,  weight loss or weight gain, cough, abd pain, diarrhea.  Reports regular exercise including this morning (stationary bicycle).

Re:  KLEIN, Michelle
   MRN: 2474410
   DOB: 8/6/2075

Dear Dr. Keller,

Ms. Klein was seen in general neurology clinic today following her recent admission for complex migraine.   Dr. Remigio Allison was present for or performed all salient aspects of the history and physical exam and together we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan. We spent greater than 50% of the visit in education and counseling of the patient and family.

HPI: As you know, Ms. Klein is a 74 yo RH woman with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p LAD stent (2144), migraine, who was in her USOH until the afternoon of 2/6/50 when she experienced sudden onset of garbled speech and difficulty ""expressing myself"" while cooking lunch for she and her husband.  This episode was accompanied shortly thereafter by a dull, L fronto-temporal headache that persisted for several hours.  She states she did not have word-finding difficulties but simply had trouble articulating herself.   In particular she related several examples of semantic paraphasic errors.  The episode came on suddenly and lasted 1-2 hours before she resolved back to baseline.  In addition to headache, associated symptoms included generalized weakness, feeling cold and mildly nauseated.  She denied visual changes, chest pain, sob, palpitations, lightheadedness, vertigo, difficulty with swallowing, coordination or gait.  She describes having a glass of orange juice with the thought that her sugar might be low, without apparent effect.  She recalled one similar episode ~ 2 years ago at which time she had her husband drive her home and she went to bed.  The speech difficulty had resolved by morning, and she apparently never told her physician or had any further work-up.  She has no known history of seizures but migraines occur 1-2x/year, last 30 minutes to several hours and are typically preceeded by scintillating scotoma (   jagged horizontal lines   ), associated with nausea/photophobia, and relieved by sleep.

Given her multiple vascular risk factors, she was admitted for TIA work-up which was unremarkable with the exception of mildly elevated HbA1c (7.0) including lipids, ESR, homocysteine, lipoprotein (a), TTE and holter.  CT/CT-a and MRI did not show any evidence of acute stroke or significant cervical or intracranial arterial stenosis.  She was discharged on her home medications, which included ASA 325mg po qd, with a diagnosis of complex migraine.  Since return home, she has had additional typical episodes of migraine, (about every 2 weeks) without the aphasia which brought her into the hospital.  She has tried Excedrin migraine a few times recently, with good results.

ROS:  Sometimes    sees stars    when she stands up too quickly after bending over.  Similarly feels that her balance is transiently affected when getting out of bed in the morning (   I rock   ).  She is awaiting thyroid biopsy of the nodules incidentally discovered on CT-CT-a.  Negative in detail including change in weight, energy, appetite, CP, palpitations, SOB, DOE, N/V/D/cough, fever, chills, rash, BRBPR, melena, abdominal pain, change in bowel or bladder habits.  In addition, patient denies change in vision, hearing, tinnitus, vertigo, numbness, weakness, slurred speech, difficulty with language, swallowing, eating, or gait.

CT/CT-a Head/Neck: Small L PICA infundibulum.  Multiple thyroid nodules.
MRI Brain: No evidence of acute infarct, partially empty sella, nonspecific periventricular white matter T2 hyperintensities consistent with small vessel disease.

Impression and Recommendations:  74 yo RH woman with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p LAD stent (2144), migraine s/p recent episode of transient aphasia and headache thought most likely to represent complex migraine given clinical presentation and after largely unremarkable stroke/TIA work-up.  Since discharge, she has continued to have her baseline migraines at a frequency of ~ 2x/month.  At this point, we would not recommend beginning prophylactic therapy, but would consider doing so if attacks become more frequent.  Given her clinical response to Excedrin migraine, we have suggested continuing this drug for abortive therapy, but have spoken at length about the phenomenon of rebound headache and cautioned her about using it more than once every 10-14 days.  We have discussed the phenomenon of complex migraine and reinforced the inherent difficulties of distinguishing these attacks from TIA/stroke; thus we have urged to continue to take unusual non-stereotyped deficits seriously.  She will follow-up with us in 4-6 months or sooner if the need arises. 

Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient.  We look forward to seeing her in follow-up.

Sincerely,

Dear Whitney:

  I was pleased to see Michelle Klein this morning for a post hospitalization followup evaluation.  You know Michelle well, she does have coronary artery disease, has had an LAD stent placed in 2148, and had a normal stress sestamibi study in November 2151.  She has moderate mitral insufficiency.  Her left atrial dimension is 52 and RV pressure 42.  She is diabetic and has hypertension.  She was hospitalized with a diarrheal bleeding issue attributed to salmonella infection attributed to tomatoes it also affecting her husband and this was accomplished at the Copley Hospital.

Her medications were modified somewhat.  She presently takes atenolol 50 mg a day, verapamil 120 mg per day, Lipitor 10 mg a day, Diovan 80 mg per day, they held her aspirin and her Imdur, she takes Prilosec 40 mg BID, and metformin 500 mg BID.  Her blood pressure remains high today at 147/70, it had been similar range when I saw her in June this year.  Pending her diarrhea at home, we may need to go back up on some of her medications, but at this point we will change.  She is symptom free vis-a-vie her heart.

Her exam shows no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  Normal thyroid, normal neck veins, and arteries.  Clear lungs.  Normal abdomen, nontender, and no mass felt.  Her heart palpates normally.  There were no thrills and no scars.  Her first sound is soft and second is normal.  There is a 1/6 apical mitral insufficiency murmur with positive response to isometrics.  There were no diastolic murmurs.  Blood pressure is 145/70.

The electrocardiogram was normal with trace nonspecific ST flattening.

I will plan to reassess Michelle in four months and she will have a recheck several times a month of her blood pressure at home and she will send diaries to me.  If her blood pressure is continued at home to be in her present level, we will advance her medications to accommodate this.  If there are any questions feel free to call me.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Dr. Newby:

  I was happy to see Michelle Klein (2474410: DOB August 6, 2075) who comes along with her husband, Nathaniel, for follow up cardiac evaluation. Michelle has been stable from a cardiac point of view. She has coronary artery disease and underwent LAD stent placement in 2148. She had negative stress sestamibi study in November 2151. She has been free of angina or cardiac-related symptoms. She notes occasional orthostatic dizziness. Her prior stamina symptoms have improved greatly. She has well-controlled hypertension on stable medical regimen. Her recent diagnosis of myelofibrosis has been followed through closely by her hematology group here at Valley County and we have discussed this at length. Michelle feels far better than at her last several visits and I am very happy to see this.

On clinical exam, blood pressure right arm is 130/80 mmHg, pulses are equal, normal and all well felt. First heart sound is normal to soft. Second is normal. There is a 1+/6 systolic apical murmur. No diastolic murmurs are present. No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. Thyroid is postoperative and stable. Neck veins are flat. Carotid upstrokes are normal. Lungs are clear. Abdominal exam is normal. I do not feel enlargement of the abdominal aorta.

The electrocardiogram is unchanged. It continues to show minimal nonspecific ST flattening and left atrial prominence.

Medications: Michelle no longer takes the verapamil, atenolol 50 mg per day, Lipitor 10 mg per day, Diovan 40 mg daily, Protonix 40 mg b.i.d., Synthroid 1.12 mg per day, vitamin B12 500 mg, B6 100 mg, magnesium 400 mg per day, and D3 2000 IU per day.

If there are any questions at anytime, please call me. I am happy to see Michelle 's spirits are good and that she is feeling better and actually, her clinical exam seems excellent as well. She does not manifest tachycardia. I note that her hematocrit is 31%.  Visit duration 40 min.-half in discussion re he cardiac and hematologic issues.

Best regards.

Sincerely yours,

	
Tony Wilkinson, MD

RE:  I had the pleasure of seeing Verna Cantu in consultation today for management of coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis.

Dear Dr. Levon Nichols,

  She is a very pleasant 60 year old female with cardiovascular risk factors of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, peripheral arterial disease, and prior tobacco abuse. She has no prior history of myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, or congestive heart failure. About 15 years ago she underwent an ETT for evaluation of exertional lightheadedness which by her reports was unremarkable. 
She has an extensive vascular history s/p right popliteal PTA/Stent and left common femoral endarterectomy for which she has been receiving regular care from Dr. Nichols. She has a history of mixed connective tissue disease with Raynaud's for which she has been followed by Dr. Lucille Jackson. 

She reports that for the past year she has had dyspnea on exertion which typically manifests itself when she is trying to climb the 2.5 flights of stairs that she has at home. She feels shortness of breath requiring her to stop when she gets to the top. She denies exertional chest pain or lightheadedness. She denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or edema. She denies lightheadedness, dizziness, palpitations, or syncope. Currently she reports no symptoms of claudication. No regular exercise. A couple of times a day. Bowls on Sunday night with no shortness of breath. She has also been noted to have a systolic murmur on previous exams. An echocardiogram in 2094 revealed aortic valve leaflet thickening but did not report significant aortic stenosis, though this was a technically difficult study by report. 

For evaluation of these symptoms she underwent an ETT-MIBI which was notable for poor exercise capacity, drop in blood pressure, exercise induced LBBB, and perfusion abnormality suggesting distal LAD territory ischemia.

History of Presenting Illness
Mrs. Cantu is a 60 year old female with a history of peripheral arterial disease, aortic stenosis, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease.

For the past year she has had dyspnea on exertion, especially with a flight of stairs. She must stop at the top to rest. She denies chest pain, lightheadedness, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, syncope, or lower extremity edema. A recent echocardiogram in February revealed an ejection fraction of 71%, mild mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 45mmHg, mean of 29mmHg, and a valve area of 0.8 sq cm. There are no wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricle. A stress test in February revealed a reduced exercise capacity with a small area of mild apical ischemia and ejection fraction of 77%. A cardiac catheterization on 3/8 revealed 50% left main stenosis, 40-50% left anterior descending, 30% circumflex and 50% right coronary artery stenosis. Aortic valve area was noted at 0.98 sq cm. Carotid non-invasive studies revealed bilateral 20-49% stenosis.

She was referred to Dr. Gonzalez for an aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. She presents today for preoperative testing and evaluation. She currently notes dyspnea on exertion with two flights of stairs. She denies chest pain, dizziness, or diaphoresis.

Re:  Verna Cantu
ESH #:033-98-74


I had the pleasure of seeing Verna and her daughter in my office today after her aortic valve replacement with a 19 mm Magna Ease, aortic root enlargement, and two-vessel coronary bypass grafting with a LIMA to the LAD and a saphenous vein to the posterior left ventricular branch.  

As you know, she is a 60-year-old woman with a history of peripheral arterial disease, aortic stenosis, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease who has had progressive dyspnea on exertion especially with walking up into her house which is 25 stairs.  We did her surgery, and she had a very uneventful postoperative course.  

She was discharged home on postoperative day seven and has continued to make progress.  She is walking each day.  Her medications include 5 mg of Norvasc, 25 mg of Toprol-XL, 20 mg of simvastatin and an aspirin and her Plaquenil.  She has no complaints of pain.  She is eating well.  She is sleeping well.  Her incisions have healed nicely.  Her sternum is stable, and she has no murmurs.  Overall, I am extremely pleased with her progress.  I told her to suggest to you that she was interested in cardiac rehab which she should be able to start in the next week or two.

Thank you so much for the opportunity of caring for her.

Rheumatology Visit
CANTU, VERNA L                        
MRN:  0261948

Date of Visit:  01/26/2098



Background:

Ms. Cantu is a 61-year-old diabetic woman with long-standing hypertension and peripheral vascular disease. She is followed in rheumatology for mixed connective tissue disease. She was initially seen in March 2094, when she was admitted with fever, nausea and chest pain. Her chest CT showed an interstitial pattern and a patulous esophagus; the interstitial lung disease was thought to be in part due to the mixed connective tissue disease and in part due to aspiration. She was also noted at that time to have an ANA 1:2560 speckled with positive RNP, negative Scl-70. Clinically, she had Sjogren's with sclerodermatous changes to her hands and telangiectasias across her face. The Raynaud's was exacerbated by the extensive peripheral vascular disease and she had to undergo stenting of the right common femoral artery 11/2095. Slowly these lesions healed. 


Interim Issues:
The diabetes and hypertension slowly became well controlled. But on exercise tolerance test, she presented with significant coronary artery disease and was noted to have significant aortic stenosis. In April 2097 she underwent stenting and she had a prosthetic aortic valve placed. Recovering from surgery has been slow. But it has been steady and uncomplicated. She can now go up 2 flights of stairs, then rest to go the third flight to her home. She has had no recurrent chest pain. She keeps her hands and feet warm and has had no tissue damage. She feels a little tightness in the chest wall in taking a deep breath (points anteriorly), but no dyspnea per se. She healed well postoperatively. She has recently been seen by cardiology and Dr. Nichols and seems to be in good shape. Her medications were reviewed and updated in the LMR. 



In terms of the MCTD, she continues to have some Raynaud's. She tries to keep her hands warm and she has had little breakdown of the tissue but rather thickening of her hands. What troubles her most is the intermittent synovitis. She felt much better on 5 mg of prednisone daily. She remains on Plaquenil 200 mg daily. She has had no worsening swallowing.  She has had no fever, pneumonia or progressive dyspnea on exertion. She sleeps on two pillows. She denies waking up with any bitterness in her mouth. She continues on omeprazole. Complete ROS in detail is otherwise negative. 


MEDS:
Amlodipine 5 MG QD 
Aspirin  325 MG QD  
Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 MG QD 
Lisinopril 2.5 MG QD 
Metformin 500 MG BID 
Metoprolol Succinate Extended Release 25 MG QD 
Plaquenil  200 MG  QD 
Simvastatin 20 MG  QHS



FH/SH: She comes in with her husband, who feels she is doing very well and is delighted to see her better. Ms. Cantu went back to work 3 months after surgery. 


PMH: 

DM. 

Hypertension. 

Peripheral artery disease. 

ASCVD with mild bilateral carotid stenosis (2096). 

Melanoma (surgical resection right thigh in 2077).

ALLERGIES: NKDA. 



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
BP 132/71, P 86, RR 16, Temp 97.7 F, Wt 132 lb
O2 SAT 98
PAIN LEVEL (0-10) 0
She has telangiectasias over her face. She looks well to me. Her color is good and she smiles easily. She has profound dryness of her mouth, but no particular injection of her eyes. Her neck is reasonably supple, the skin tightened here. Perhaps tightened a bit over her face as well. But the chest wall itself has no scleroderma. The midline scar has healed beautifully. The respiratory excursions appear full. There is no splinting. There are some bilateral crackles. Her hands are thickened from the scleroderma aspect of her disease. There are no nail bed infarcts. There is some peripheral pitting of digits. Her feet are well healed, warm and well perfused. Her joints are benign today with no active synovitis. Heart: S1, S2 with a soft crisp, S2 noted. No insufficiency murmurs. 



IMPRESSION: 

MCTD/Raynaud's.
Sjogren's

ASCVD with aortic valve replacement 4/2097. 

PVD. 


PLAN

Education regarding the importance of protection re: trauma to finger tips and prevention of Raynaud's. 
Continue Prilosec, refill Plaquenil
Prescribe prednisone 5 mg p.r.n. arthritis. I think it would be safe for her to take every morning as long as her diabetes remains well controlled and she feels much better on it; that is, the benefits outweigh the risks. 


Her labs have been sent and a chest x-ray obtained. 


I will see her in 6 months, sooner if there are any issues in the interim. 
Interview time 45 minutes due to medical history review, questions and verification of medications with the patient. 


She and her husband agree with this plan.

I think Dr. Jaimes is a superb cardiologist and I gave him the number for GCH teleservices to find himself a new internist. He clearly is somewhat conflicted about this and will think about it.

This patient of Dr. Bridges was seen because Dr. Bridges was
called away on an emergency basis.

His major concern is results of recent vascular studies.  He has
known diabetes and has a history of several years of exertional
cramping and discomfort in his legs.  This occurs only with heavy
exertion.  Dr. Bridges documented normal pedal pulses the last
visit.

His recent vascular studies showed no significant drop off and
perfusion pressures level of the ankle.

Did given his history a more inclined to suspect this might be
pseudoclaudication due to neuropathy or spinal stenosis.  He will
follow up with Dr. Bridges about next steps.

Ret he declines a flu shot today.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an elderly patient, 82, with known diabetes and coronary artery disease, which has required placement of a pacemaker.



I last saw his blood sugar and it was 276 and his A1c in October was 7.  So, I had him back today to discuss diabetic management and also review his general health in terms of his diabetes and his other medications.



We went over his medications to start with and he is taking them exactly as it was shown in the computer.  These include atenolol 25, Glucotrol 10 twice a day, Actos 45, Lipitor 40 a day, Lasix 40 a day, and Procardia XL 60 mg q.d., and Coumadin.  He is followed by Dr. Itzel Jaimes for his cardiac problems and by a diabetologist at the Claiborne for managing his diabetes.



He had no other complaints.  His bowel movements are regular.  He still has nocturia x3 and was recently seen by a urologist who felt there was no need for any intervention.



He otherwise was in good spirits and has no immediate complaints.



His social situation, his allergies and and his family history and past medical history, are overall as previously recorded.  There are no other pertinent findings in the review of systems.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure was 140/60.  He looks well.  I did not measure his weight.  His heart rate was around 64-68.  His pupils are equal and reactive to light and extraocular movements were full.  Mucous membranes of the mouth and tongue were normal.  Lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation.  Cardiac exam showed regular sinus rhythm, a normal S2 and no significant murmurs.  Liver and spleen were not palpable.  He had only 1+ peripheral edema which is less than usual.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  He seems stable, I think the biggest problem is regulation of diabetes and I have asked him to get a hemoglobin A1c and to measure his blood sugar when he gets up in the morning and in the afternoon before he has supper.  He will come back to see me in about a month's time to follow up on these issues. CAD is stable with pacemaker



HGB A1c is 7.0, Hct is down to 31.6, epo 37, creatinine stable at 1.6, MCV 93.3.  Most likely anemia of chronic illness but need to check smear and stools

Urology Consult Note


Patient Name:  Michael Yee
PH#:  69044681
Date/Time:  12/24/94; 2:30 PM
Attending:  Dr. Quintrell Ferreira


CC:          presumed UTI in the setting of indwelling B ureteral stents


HPI:          77M w/ multiple medical problems including muscular dystrophy and B ureteral obstruction (diagnosed 10/93 in the setting of B hydroureteronephrosis and ARF) managed initially with B ureteral stents (most recently changed 2/26/94), currently admitted to the medical service 12/23/94 with FTT, anemia, hyperkalemia, and a presumed UTI.


He was brought to the PH ED yesterday by his wife, who noted that he was lethargic and confused for 3 days (reportedly similar to previous UTI presentations).  She felt that his urine output had decreased at home, and that his urine had been foul-smelling for two days.  He was treated empirically with levofloxacin and transfused 2U PRBC for HCT 26.  His Cr was elevated at 3.1, and his K was 6.4.  He was admitted to a telemetry bed on the medical service for management of the above issues.  The patient has been hemodynamically stable, and his only subjective complaint has been general malaise.


We are consulted with the question of whether his stents may be changed during his current admission.


PMH:        Duchenne&#8217;s muscular dystrophy, COPD (2.5L home O2), IDDM, recurrent UTIs w/ previous Candida tropicalis fungemia (followed by Dr. Phoebe Abreu), B ureteral obstruction s/p ureteral stent placement, CAD s/p CABG, PVD, SZ disorder, hyperkalemia secondary to hyperaldosteronemia (type III RTA), CRI (baseline 1.5)

A/P:  77M w/ multiple medical problems including muscular dystrophy and B ureteral obstruction, now admitted w/ ARF, hyperkalemia, anemia, and a presumed UTI.  His U/A and UCx are not overwhelmingly c/w a UTI, but his clinical presentation was reportedly similar to prior UTI presentations.  He is being managed by ID.  His ureteral stents were last changed 2/94, but he has never obtained a diagnosis for his B ureteral obstruction.  His abdominal CT is pending.  He remains clinically stable, with significantly improved cognition and awareness since admission.  As such, we recommend:
--F/U UCx and ID recs, as you are doing.
--F/U CT A/P to assess for recurrent hydronephrosis.  Depending on the results of this study, we will consider ureteral stent change vs. staged removal.  Regardless of his eventual stent plan, he should be medically cleared for an operative procedure, which would entail stabilization of his hyperkalemia prior to undergoing anaesthesia.


D/w Dr. Ferreira, who agrees with above plan.  Thank you for allowing us to continue our involvement in the care of this unfortunate patient.

CARDIOLOGY

BETHESDA MEMORIAL HOSPITAL



Xavier T Huerta M.D. 

BMH Health Associates

583 Appaloosa Place

CHESTERTOWN, NY 91987



Dear Dr. Huerta:



Reason for visit:

   Today, I had the pleasure of seeing Irving Vera in Cardiology clinic. He is a former patient of Dr. Ilya Light. He is a 59-year-old man with diabetes type 2, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and mild coronary artery disease who had a brief episode of atrial flutter in 2069. He presented in 2069 with chest pain and rapid heart rate following snow shoveling. He was found to be in atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response. He was cardioverted two days later and has remained in sinus rhythm since then. Echocardiogram performed on 02/22/2069 showed normal ejection fraction of 72%, borderline left atrium at 43 mm, and no significant valvular abnormalities. Stress test performed on 03/16/2069 showed 5 minutes of exercise, 7 METS, and a peak double product of 22, 000. He had no EKG changes, and a small mild posterobasilar defect suggestive of a very limited area of mild ischemia. The patient has been managed medically since then. He has used an event monitor and since then has not had any subsequent episodes of atrial flutter or fibrillation.



The patient has been doing well over the past several months. Currently, he exercises once or twice a week by swimming 30 minutes in a pool. A few months ago, he was exercising almost everyday. His weight has been up and down. He does not complain of any chest pain, shortness of breath, or other symptoms. Occasionally in the morning when he takes his pulse, he notices a skipped beat. I have reassured him that this is not a cause for concern.



Past medical history:

   Diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atrial flutter as above, coronary artery disease as above, Bell's palsy with residual left eye tearing, kidney stones, and glaucoma.



Current Medications:

  lisinopril 20 mg QD

 Glucophage 1 g BID

 glyburide 10 mg BID

 atenolol 50 mg QAM; Dir: and 25 mg QPM

 Lopid 600 mg BID

 allopurinol 300 mg QD

 omeprazole 20 mg QD

 aspirin 81 mg QD

 Pravachol 80 mg QD

 Avandia 8 mg QD



Allergies:

Penicillin allergy   Penicillin and erythromycin, causing rash.



Family history:

   Not significant for coronary artery disease.



Social history:

   Former tobacco user, works part time in securities.



Review of systems:

   As above, otherwise negative.



Physical examination:

-Pulse:   60

-General:   Obese talkative man in no distress

-Chest:   Lungs are clear bilaterally

-Cardiac:   JVP is 7 cm with normal waveform.  PMI is discrete and nondisplaced.  Regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2.  Soft 2/6 holosystolic murmur heard at the lower left sternal border

-Abdomen:   Obese and tender

-Extremities:   Have trace edema with chronic venous stasis changes



Selected recent labs:

   On 06/18/2070, total cholesterol 168, triglycerides 104, HDL 38, and LDL 109.  His Pravachol dose has been increased since this time.



Assessment and plan:

   This is a 59-year-old man with metabolic syndrome, diabetes type 2, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and mild coronary artery disease that has been medically managed. He is doing well. He had an episode of atrial flutter for two days in 2069 but has not had any repeat episodes. He is currently not anticoagulated. Given new recommendations, his target LDL should be less than 70. He is due for a fasting lipid profile in one week. If his LDL is not below 70, then he should either be switched to Lipitor 80 mg day or Zetia should be added to his present regimen. He is slightly hypertensive today with a blood pressure of 140/75. The patient will check his blood pressure at home since he is somewhat anxious male. In the office today, if his blood pressure remains elevated, then I will increase his lisinopril to 30 mg a day. Otherwise, he is doing very well without any cardiac symptoms.



Changes to Medications this visit

lisinopril 20 mg   QD

Glucophage 1 g   BID

glyburide 10 mg   BID

atenolol 50 mg   QAM and 25 mg QPM

Lopid 600 mg   BID

Hunt, Xavier I., MD","Record date: 2090-10-07





 

NAME:     Olivo, Kimberly

MRN:      3299811 



INITIAL VISIT 



This is a 69-year-old white female coming for her fu visit. 



The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus and pituitary adenoma and

recently was hospitalized at American Legion Hospital with general malaise

syndrome and back/chest pain.  Initially the patient was seen at Neligh Clinic and cardiac ischemia was ruled out.  She was found to have a blood

pressure of 250 systolic at Neligh Clinic associated with persistent

headaches.  She was transferred to American Legion Hospital after being

found collapsed on the floor of the hospital bathroom.  She was transferred to the

Intensive Care Unit at Neligh Clinic and treated for tonic-clonic

convulsions with diazepam and lorazepam. She also suffered a urinary tract

infection in hospital, treated with Cipro.



She was transferred to the American Legion Hospital on October 02, 2089,

at which time she was awake but unable to give a history. 



On admission to American Legion Hospital she had a blood pressure of

127/70, pulse was 80, and temperature was 99.3.  She had a myxedematous face and

was obese.  She was cardiovascularly stable.  Neurologically, she was able to move

all four extremities with good strength and symmetrical reflexes.  Cranial nerves

intact.  Initially, the impression was that patient suffered seizure secondary to

elevated blood pressure.  Most likely, she suffered hypertensive encephalopathy. 

Patient underwent neurologic evaluation including MRA of the brain, lumbar

puncture, both of which were negative.  Electroencephalogram was  performed and

showed no epileptiform foci and diffuse temporal slowing bilaterally.  The patient's

alertness and responsiveness increased gradually during the hospital stay.  She had

an episode of chest pain which was associated with some ST flattening in the lateral

leads.  Acute cardiac event was ruled out.  The patient underwent a course of

physical therapy and then, finally, was transferred to a rehabilitation facility.  A

specific cause of the patient's seizure was not found although it was assumed that

this might have been provoked by the hypertensive encephalopathy associated with

use of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of the UTI which could have lowered her

threshold for seizure activity.  Upon discharge, the patient was in stable condition.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for seizure, type II diabetes mellitus,

panhypopituitarism secondary to pituitary surg, hypertension, right arm bone

tumor excision associated with right radial neuropathy, and hyperlipidemia.



MEDICATIONS:  See LMR.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Denies alcohol intake, smoking.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies visual or hearing disturbance, headaches,

weakness, numbness, seizure activity, chest pain, palpitations, syncope, dyspnea,

wheezing, cough, coryza, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain. 



Positive for mild nocturia with no dysuria.  No polydipsia.  Positive mild

paresthesias right upper extremity.  Occasional mid-morning reactions.  Home

blood glucose monitoring b.i.d. with most glucose readings between 100 and 200. 

Positive mild tiredness without any hoarseness, heat or cold intolerance.  Mild

arthralgia.  No bleeding, rash, pruritus. 



Diet:  Low salt.  Mets 2-3. 



ALLERGIES:  Sulfa, codeine, morphine. 



PHYSICAL EXAM:  General appearance:  Well-developed, well-nourished.  Vital

signs:  Blood pressure 130/80, respiratory rate 18, heart rate 76, temperature

afebrile.  HEENT exam:  No exophthalmos, no lid lag, equally reactive pupils,

difficult to visualize fundi; pharynx clear; ears clear.  Neck:  No JVD, no bruits,

thyroid within normal limits.   Chest:  Clear, no rales or wheezes.  Heart sounds

normal.  No murmurs.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, no organomegaly.  Extremities: 

No edema.  Neuro:  Awake and alert although at times forgets details of past

history; no focal neurologic signs.  



A/P:  

1.   Type II diabetes mellitus.good control.  Plan - Continue diet. 



2.   Panhypopituitarism secondary to  pituitary surgery for pituitary adenoma. 

     Need to obtain record from surgeon for details on what type of tumor this

     was.  Patient on replacement therapy with levothyroxine and prednisone. 

     She will continue both with the understanding that should she become sick

     for whatever reason she needs to double or triple dose her prednisone and

     contact me.  She needs to wear a bracelet for this as well as for her diabetes. 

     

3.   Seizure disorder, ? etiology.  She saw the neurologist; she will need to remain on anti-seizure medications.  



4.   Hyperlipidemia:  Plan - Check fast lipid profile.  Discussed with Dr Xavier;P:: lipitor 10 mg /d.



5  Cryptogenic cirrhosis, LFT ok; discussed with Dr Xavier ; no absolute contraindication to lipitor.

Patient Name Here: Olivo, Kimberly

MR# 3299811

Location: Suite 53-02Q

Date of Admission:  December 15, 2091	

PCP:	Isaac Ng 



ID/CC:	Change in mental status



HPI:  70 y/o Female with PMHx significant for Pituitary adenoma s/p resection, cryptogenic cirrhosis, presenting with confusion for the past 3 days. Patient confused and unable to give history at time of admission. As per son and daughter, they have noticed increasing confusion and inappropriate behavior over the past 3 days. They report that she has woken up in the middle of the night c/o feeling weak and confused. The first two nights, her son treated her  initially with increasing lactulose administration when she would wake up at night (although it is unclear whether she had any increase in her stool) and he reports that she would behave better during the day. On the night prior to administration, the patient urinated in her bed at night and called her daughter on the phone in the middle of the night. She also forgot the names of her grandchildren. The son became worried about her behavior, contacted her PCP, and brought her to the ALH ED.



The family reports that she experienced similar behavior prior to grand-mal seizures that were a consequence of uncontrolled hypertension about 2 yrs ago. She also suffers from chronic UTI's and often becomes confused during times of infection.





ED Course: Vitals T 98.2, HR 64, BP 215, 115, RR 24, Sa02 100% NRB. 

Blood Pressure: Treated with labetalol 10 mg IV x 1, Hydral 10 mg IV x 1, decreased to 176/74. 

Hyponatremia: NS x 1 L





PMH:

Pituitary adenoma  2080 s/p resection, XRT

Diabetes mellitus Type II - On Humulin 15/15 

Hypertension - on Avapro, allergy to Ace-I

Angina pectoris - negative stress 



Seizure - According to discharge summaries in YPZ, patient had two episodes of general tonic-clonic seizures at OSH prior to transfer to ALH. Extensive neuro work-up at ALH including MRI/MRA, carotid non-invasives, TCVs, EEG, LP revealed no definitive etiology of seizure but thought to be likely related to her uncontrolled hypertension with systolic BP 250's, her morbid state in setting of UTI, and lower seizure threshold with ciprofloxacin.



Hyperlipidemia - was on zocor, recently switched to zetia, ?myositis

Hypothyroid - central, secondary to pituitary XRT

CXR: 

no acute cardiopulmonary process



HEAD CT:

	CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST

	History: Mental status change. Right sided weakness. Hypertension.

	Procedure: Contiguous axial images of the head were performed from

	the skull base to the vertex without intravenous contrast. Bone

	and soft-tissue windows were reviewed.

	Comparison: MRI dated 7/16/91

	Findings:

	The cerebral parenchyma, posterior fossa, basal cisterns and

	ventricular system appear normal. There is no evidence of any mass

	or mass effect. There is no evidence of acute infarction although

	this would be better assessed by MR with diffusion. There is no

	evidence of parenchymal or extra-axial hemorrhage.

	A right frontal mucocele has enlarged since the previous exam. It

	extends into the right orbit resulting in proptosis.  There are

	bilateral lens implants.

	

IMPRESSION:

	No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Enlarging right frontal mucocele

	which causes right proptosis.



Pituitary MRI: (7/91)

	No evidence of recurrent pituitary adenoma.  Interval increase in

	the size of an expansile lesion within the right ethmoid bed, with

	increased extension into the right orbit.  The lesion contacts the

	right globe.  This lesion most likely represents a mucocele.

	

EKG:	NSR @ 73, normal axis, normal intervals, biphasic t wave v2, no sttw changes.

ENDPOINT(S):

The protocol was completed. Chest pain did not occur.

The baseline cardiac rhythm was normal sinus rhythm. The rest

electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific ST segment and T-wave

abnormalities. Small inferior q's.  No ST segment changes were observed during this test.  Negative for ischemia. However, the sensitivity of Adenosine-induced ST segment changes for detecting significant CAD is limited.

SCAN RESULTS:

The left ventricle is normal in size. Regional left ventricular perfusion is normal. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 77% on the stress study. Regional wall motion was normal on the stress study.

CONCLUSIONS:

The ECG response to pharmacological stress was  negative for ischemia. The myocardial scans are within normal limits and do not demonstrate evidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction.

FINDINGS

 No carotid bruits are heard.  Blood flow velocity is within normal limits in

 the common, internal, external carotid, and extracranial vertebral arteries,

 bilaterally.  Ophthalmic artery flow is normal in direction, via the

 transorbital approach, bilaterally.  Ultrasound visualization of the

 bifurcations is good.  There is dense plaque visualized in each bifurcation.

 Plaque does not alter flow in either vessel.



 IMPRESSIONS:

1.	MINIMAL DISEASE OF BOTH CAROTID ARTERY BIFURCATION.



LIVER, BIOPSY: (11/2089)

     

     NOTE:  There is established cirrhosis, confirmed on trichrome

     stain.  There is a mild to moderate mixed portal tract

     inflammatory infiltrate, composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells,

     and eosinophils.  There is no interface or lobular activity.

     There is mild macrovesicular steatosis. There are scattered

     glycogenated nuclei in periportal hepatocytes, consistent with

     diabetes and/or obesity. There is mild periportal edema and

     copper deposition, consistent with chronic cholestasis. There is

     no Mallory's hyaline.  There is no evidence of hemachromatosis,

     alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency or Wilson's disease based on iron,

     PAS/D, and copper stains, respectively. The inflammatory

     infiltrate is not ductulocentric, and there is minimal bile duct

     damage. Immunostains for cytokeratins 7 and 19 highlight

     bile ductular reduplication, but there is no ductopenia. The

     findings of cirrhosis are not specific, but are compatible with

     end-stage non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

Name: Ollivo, Kimberly

MRN: 3299811

Date: 6/29/97

Time of Exam: 5:20 p.m.

NICU day: 1




Critically ill secondary to: 
R. BG/thalamus hemorrhage with IVH extension, with potential for fatal neurologic deterioration

Critical Care Min: 35 min




History: Ms. Olivo is a 75-year-old RHW with DM, HTN and dementia, LSW at 11:00 a.m., then found by son at 1:45 pm to be less responsive with left-sided weakness. BP was 200/96 when EMS arrived. Here her SBP was in the 220s with heart rate in the 50-60s.  Her initial exam revealed somnolence, but able to follow some very simple commands like squeezing hand, nodding head; she had right gaze deviation, left hemianopsia, left facial palsy, left arm 
and leg plegia, right arm and leg paresis, and dysarthria.  She received 10 mg of hydralazine for her SBP greater than 220.  CT revealed a right basal ganglia/thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension including casting of the 4th ventricle, 7 mm mls to the left, contrast extravasation suggestive of active hemorrhage but no evidence of any vascular abnormality.  She was intubated for worsening mental status and had an a-line placed for Bp monitoring and management. 



At baseline, Ms. Olivo is wheelchair-bound, according to her daughter, due to her neuropathy.  She is dependent for all of her ADLs and has a home health aide.  



PMHx: DM, HTN, dementia, h/o sz d/o not on AED now, Pituitary adenoma, s/p hypophysectomy, hypothyroidism, COPD, dyslipidemia, obesity, fatty liver, fibromyalgia, arthritis, depression, anxiety, meningitis, Rt humerus fx/osteo/nonunion, Cirrhosis or unclear etiology with hyperammonemia, Neuropathy with paresthesias, presumably due to diabetes

Neuro Exam: Off sedation &#8211; no verbal response to noxious stimuli, intermittently extensor postures; minimally reactive small pupils, midline gaze in primary position, able to x-midline, no BTT, + R. corneal brisk vs. L., grimace to nasal tickle better on the L. than on the R., R. UE slight w/d to deep noxious stim, plegic in LUE., w/d briskly in the L. LE vs. RLE, toes up b/l




Imaging/Studies/TCD: 

Head CT/A (6/29):  Prelim read shows a right basal ganglia/thalamic hemorrhage (1.87 cm x 4.5 cm in largest dimension) with intraventricular extension including casting of the 4th ventricle, and mls of 7 mm to the left.  CTA showed at least 3 spot signs indicating active hemorrhage but no evidence of any vascular abnormality.





Assessment: 
Olivo is a 75-year-old right-handed woman with diabetes mellitus, HTN and dementia, and found with a ~ 11 cc R. BG/thalamic bleed with pan-ventricular extension with casted 3rd and 4th ventricles, and mild midline shift. The etiology appears to be hypertensive in nature; CTA was negative for a vascular anomaly. A mass lesion cannot be excluded at this time however, and will need an MRI. Her prognosis is somewhat difficult to articulate at this time using the conventional FUNC  (8) and ICH (2) scores given her clinical status and medical  comorbidities.

The patient was interviewed and examined by me as well as by the 

resident.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  In brief, this is a 64-year-old 

gentleman with morbid obesity.  He is on CPAP.  He has CHF, 

hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, triple bypass, and 

diabetes.  He had three episodes of chest pain which woke him up 

from CPAP last last night.  Each episode reminded him of his 

typical angina, but the last time he had it was in May.  Those 

three episodes were resolved with one sublingual nitroglycerin.  He 

woke up today and thought he needed to be evaluated.  He is also 

complaining of low grade temperature.  He has recently been 

receiving VNA services as a result of a left foot ulcer as a result 

of an oxygen tank burn.  His VNA came to visit him today and found 

that he had some crackles in his lungs with a temperature and was 

concerned about a pneumonia.  Please see the resident's note for 

details. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denies chest pain now.  No shortness of 

breath now.  He states that his foot appears to be getting better.

MEDICATIONS:  Atenolol, aspirin, isosorbide, Lasix, Glyburide, 

Lipitor, and Lorazepam.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL APPEARANCE:  The patient is a 

morbidly obese gentleman.  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 100.2, pulse 

62, respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 173/74.  O2 saturation is 

99%.  LUNGS:  He has rales at the right base.  Unable to assess 

JVD.  ABDOMEN:  He is obese with active bowel sounds.  EXTREMITIES: 

Distal left foot lateral ulcer is dry, necrotic, without 

surrounding edema or tenderness.

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  His white count here is 14.  His BUN and 

creatinine are 25 and 2.4, which is his baseline.  CK is 28, 

troponin pending.  INR is 1.2.  EKG shows no changes from prior.  

Chest x-ray shows right pleural effusion with question right 

paratracheal mass.

CONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  His care was discussed with the 

Christus Spohn cardiology.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Unstable angina pectoris.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  He is going to 

be treated with antibiotics, aspirin, Lopressor, and admitted to 

the hospital for a rule out.  Condition on admission is stable.  He 

will be presumptively treated for a pneumonia on the right side.

Neurological:  Alert and oriented.  Cranial nerves II through XII

are intact.  There are no motor or sensory deficits.

Initial cardiogram showing numerous PVCs with occasional negative

complex is consistent with her previous EKG with the appearance

of likely atrial fibrillation.  After some diuresis and a beta

blockade, she has slowed down to the 90s from the 130s and

appeared to have normal sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs.  Her

chest film shows some mild CHF, and she was started on heparin.

LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 134, glucose 178.  Normal extending

chemistries.  CK of 115 with an MB of 2.  Digoxin level is 0.8. 

TSH is 8.8.  Troponin is less than assay.  White count is 7.5,

hematocrit 42, and platelets 238,000.  INR 2.1.  Heparin was not

initiated as she was already anticoagulated, but she did receive

diuresis.  She is admitted in stable condition.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old female

with end-stage cardiac disease with ischemic cardiomyopathy, who

I see together with the resident.  The resident's history was

reviewed.  The patient was interviewed and examined by me.  In

brief, apparently the EMS was summoned to the scene inadvertently

this morning.  She is end-stage, she is on hospice and comfort

measures only, and she apparently was quite poorly feeling this

morning and was transported.  Her son has called several times

and wants to transport her back in a discussion with her.  She is

quite weak and understands her circumstances, wishes to be

transported back as well.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, REVIEW OF SYSTEMS, SOCIAL HISTORY,

MEDICATIONS, AND ALLERGIES:  All per the chart.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is alert.  She certainly appears

end-stage.  She has a JVP at 14-16 cm.  She has lungs with

decreased breath sounds throughout her heart.  There is a 3/6

holosystolic murmur heard very weakly.  Her abdomen is soft and

nontender without organomegaly.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  She has electrocardiogram, which is

remarkable for sinus rhythm with nonspecific intraventricular

conduction delay and ugly appearing.  Electrocardiogram is rather

wide complexed.  She has a first-degree AV block and a leftward

axis.  The case was discussed with her cardiologist, social

worker, case manager, and family and she is discharged home.

IMPRESSION:  End-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy.

DISPOSITION AND PLAN:  She is discharged home to continue with

hospice and expectant care.

PRESENTING COMPLAINT and HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The 
patient is a 68-year-old female status post CABG in September of 
this past year.  She comes in with an acute headache this morning, 
followed by a syncopal event, which lasted approximately five 
seconds.  Currently, she is complaining of intermittent chest pain 
and a continuing headache across her head and down to her eyes. 
PAST MEDICAL and SURGICAL HISTORY:  The past history is notable for 
her CABG, as well as for a history of temporal arteritis. 
MEDICATIONS:  She was on prednisone, which was recently stopped. 
The rest of the PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, MEDICATIONS, and ALLERGIES: 
As documented in the written chart by the resident physician, and 
as reviewed by me. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, she is an elderly 
black female in no acute distress.  She has a temperature of 100 
degrees F., a pulse of 90, and a blood pressure of 150/70.  The O2 
saturation is 97% on room air.  The examination is notable for a 
surgically altered pupil in the right eye, which is non-reactive. 
The extraocular movements are intact.  She has no palpable temporal 
or skull tenderness.  The lungs show rhonchorous breath sounds 
throughout.  The cardiovascular examination shows a midline scar, 
with a regular rate and rhythm and no murmur.  The abdomen is soft 
and non-tender.  The extremities show 1+ pitting edema bilaterally. 
The neurologic examination is grossly intact. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  This is an elderly female status 
post recent CABG, who had a syncopal episode this morning after 
complaining of a headache.  The plan at this time is to obtain a 
head CT to rule out an intracerebral process.  She has had an EKG, 
which does show some T-wave changes, different from when she was 
here for her CABG.  She will also have cardiac enzymes sent and 
will be admitted to the hospital for further monitoring of her 
syncopal event. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  As above.  The 
patient's condition on admission is stable.

L ICA stenosis and/or embolic event +/- fetal left PCA possible concerns (?cortical vs v-b etiology of dizziness). Cannot obtain CTA secondary to elevated creatinine.  



Plan:  

1.	Admit to RDA 

2.	MRI/MRA. MR Perfusion study if L ICA stenosis or suggestion of intracranial stenosis. 

3.	As event occurred on ASA, provide heparin PTT 60-80, continue ASA at decreased dose (81 qD). Watch platelets, as pt starting with platelets =  150

4.	Hold antihypertensive, but continue isosorbide for known cardiac ischemic history. 

5.	Echo, Holter (for known bradycardia; eval for events with HR <<40. 

6.	PT/speech therapy. 

7.	Careful glycemic control (holding metformin).

INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES

HOLDEN DISTRICT HOSPITAL



Reason for visit   Three months of followup for multiple medical problems.



History of present illness   Since his last visit, he has started to resume exercising on his treadmill, but has not been watching his weight or diet.



Major Problems

Hyperlipidemia

His most recent labs are within reasonable range with an LDL of 76 and fasting triglycerides 263, which improved from his previous values.  He has been intolerant to Lopid which resulted in pancreatitis.  He has not lost any weight, but has begun to exercise.

Allergic rhinitis

He has chronic postnasal drip and nasal congestion for which he uses Nasonex on a regular basis with some improvement.  He has had no sinus pains, headache, or recent sinusitis.

Cerebrovascular accident

The patient has had no recent neurological symptoms or changes.  He had a mild aphasia which has totally resolved.  He has had no headaches or any focal symptoms.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease

The patient continues on his ranitidine at night with improvement in his intermittent epigastric discomfort.

Sleep apnea

The patient had a sleep study in November 2091 due to excessive fatigue and snoring.  He was noted to have sleep apnea, and CPAP was prescribed.  He has not been using the CPAP since he was recently on vacation, but he plans to start in the near future.  During his sleep study, he was not uncomfortable wearing the mask and hopefully, this will help.

Prostatic carcinoma

The patient is followed regularly by the urologist and last had a visit in January 2092 with PSA in a very good range at less than 0.2.  He has no dysuria, urgency, frequency, or significant nocturia.

Carpal tunnel syndrome

Currently, he does not complain of any pain or paresthesias in his wrists.

Coronary artery disease

The patient has had no angina since his last visit.  He exercises on a treadmill five times a week and can walk up to five miles in any given setting.  He does not have any palpitations, chest pressure, pain, or significant dyspnea on exertion.

Diabetes mellitus

The patient checks his blood sugars at home, and they have been in the 120 range, although he admits to not losing weight and on his recent trip was not exercising as regularly.  He has had no symptoms with hypoglycemia.

Hypertension

The patient monitors his blood pressure closely at home and finds it to be at around 120/70.  He has not had any headaches or any other focal symptoms.

Atrial fibrillation - Inactivated



Bronchitis - Inactivated





Allergies

Allergic drug reaction   Acf inhibitor - cough. Procardia - leg edema. Lopid - pancreatitis. Cardura - ankle swelling. Dyazide - elevated bun/creat. Exedrin - rash. Amox - vomiting. Norvasc - leg edema. HCTZ - rash per derm. Estynil - rash.

Reason for visit

			

  Followup of multiple issues.



History of present illness

			

  Since his last visit, the patient has had two episodes of pressure in his chest.  This occurred approximately one week ago in the setting of walking up the stairs and carrying a heavy package.  He notes that his pulse went up to 101 and he had overall felt ""tired in his chest"".  He did not take any nitroglycerine, and his symptoms promptly resolved.  He has continued to notice episodes of intermittent rapid pulses with pulses up to 100.  He has had no syncope or near syncope.  Generally, he has been walking on the treadmill up to four to six miles a day several times a week.  Over the last few weeks, he has felt a little bit more fatigued and now can only walk approximately four miles.  He has not had any sustained palpitation, syncope, or near syncope, but has noted a slight decrease in his exercise tolerance.

  The patient's symptoms and exam as well as EKG are consistent with atrial fibrillation.  Of note, the patient had a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation after his CABG.  However, he has not had any significant symptoms since that time.  He remains active without any evidence of congestive heart failure on exam.  He continues to exercise on a regular basis.  Given his slightly elevated pulse rate, his atenolol will be increased to 25 mg PO BID from one per day which is what he is currently taking.  His blood pressure is under good control.  Given his recent episode of repeat stress test will be sent.  If there is any prolonged episode of pain, he will come to the emergency room immediately.

Reason for visit

			

  Followup of recent MI and multiple medical problems.



History of present illness

			

  Since the patient's last visit, he developed a maculopapular rash and his Plavix was discontinued.  Since this is the only new medication, it was presumed that Plavix was the cause of the new skin rash.  He also changed his beta blocker and started Toprol XL approximately one week ago.  At home, he states his pulse has been under better control, and now, is in the 60 range.  He denies any palpitations, PND, orthopnea, or shortness of breath.  He has had no recurrent angina and has tried this week to slowly start to walk for about 15 minutes on his treadmill at a low pace.  He has not had any angina or chest pain with this walking routine.  He also knows that his sugars at home had been very low at 55 and 56 in the evening.  He has had weight loss and slightly diminished appetite and this may account for his low blood sugars.  He is here for a followup.  Of note, his Bumex dose was decreased due to an elevated BUN and creatinine.  His weight has been stabled, and he feels better on the lower dose of diuretics without symptoms of congestive heart failure.

Assessment and plan

			

  The patient's multiple issues were reviewed with the patient in detail.  His weight has remained fairly stable on the lower dose of diuretics, and a repeat BUN and creatinine were sent today.  He was volume depleted at his last visit.  Currently, he has no symptoms of unstable angina and no evidence of congestive heart failure on exam.  His blood sugars have been low, and therefore, he will hold his glyburide for now.  His pulse remained somewhat elevated, and he will follow up with his cardiologist relative to the need for cardioversion for an attempt to get him back into normal sinus rhythm.  His weight control has been a problem.  He will slowly increase his ambulation and will check his pulse and blood pressure at home.  He will follow up here in two months or sooner if needed.

OFFICE VISIT (CHC)
The patient is seen in followup at the Community Health.  He came back from Pennsylvania after being there about a month.  He has had an eventful past six months.  In October, he apparently had a TIA or small stroke.  He was evaluated with an MRA of his neck and was told that there was not enough blockage to warrant surgery.  His symptomatology fortunately clear.  His symptoms were related to loss of feeling in his right upper extremity.  About this time, he also developed a traumatic lesion of the left second toe.  He apparently develops some cellulitis and was treated with ampicillin.  Not long after this, he went into renal failure.  He was told that they could not tell if that was due to the antibiotics or the gadolinium.  According to the patient and his wife, his creatinine went as high as 9.  Fortunately, it is currently back down to 2.4.


His toe lesion has been very slow to improve.  He describes pain in the toe and often has to sleep in a chair with his foot dependent.  He has seen various physicians and podiatrists in Pennsylvania, without much improvement.  They finally told him, he would do well to come back here for further care and evaluation.


On examination today, I can feel femoral and popiteal pulses.  I do not feel any definite pedal pulses on either side but noninvasive study show good pulsatile flow at the calf and transmetatarsal level.  Resting ABI is good, although his diabetic calcinosis probably makes this unreliable.  He has some slight pulsatile flow at the right toe level and flat tracings at left toes.  He has 1 cm escharover the dorsum of his second toe.  There is some erythema of the toe and proximal dorsal forefoot.  This certainly has the appearance of some cellulites.  There is minimal to no swelling of the toe.


We will place him on Keflex 250 mg q.i.d. for 7 to 10 days to see if this helps with any possible associated cellulitis.  I will refer him to Dr. Caldwell for recommendations regarding wound quick care and an opinion whether or not hyperbaric oxygen therapy might be worth considering.  I do not think there is anything further we can do to improve his distal blood flow.  Further imaging will also be very difficult in view of the possible problems with gadolinium as well as his creatinine, which limit contrast administration.  His noninvasive studies suggest that his problems are all diabetic small vessel disease and it is unlikely that we could be of benefit with this.  I will await Dr. Caldwell&#8217;s opinions.","Record date: 2105-08-11


















 
 



Vascular Surgery/Emergency Department Surgical Admission Note

MRN: 9125902

Date: 8/11/05



CC: cool right foot and progressive claudication



HPI: The patient is a 74 yo male with a history of CAD, PVD s/p right femoral to above knee popliteal bypass with PTFE (5/00) who presents to the ED with right foot pain. 



The patient has developed progressive R calf pain over the past 2 months, which has become worse over the past 10 days. 
He is unable to walk more than a half block without cramping pain in his calf.  Because of his previous bypass surgery and current complaints, he underwent vascular studies today demonstrating critical atherosclerotic disease in the RLE, with markedly reduced flow through the R graft. 
The toe-brachial index was not able to be calculated on the R, and was 0.31 on the L.   He is currently taking ASA 325 mg po daily, but no plavix or Coumadin.  



Over the past week, the patient reports that his pain has become more severe.  He has otherwise felt well and in his normal state of health, and denies fevers/chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, and all other symptoms.

Imaging:

Vascular studies done today, OSH: 
patent right femoral to popliteal artery bypass graft with markedly reduced flow, toe-brachial index 0.0 &#8211; confirmed with PVR in UMH ED



Assessment/Plan:
 

The patient is an 74 yo male with a history of CAD, PVD, s/p right femoral to above knee popliteal bypass graft who presents with progressive R foot claudication X 2 weeks.  His vascular studies are concerning for progressive arterial ischemia, presumably the result of graft stenosis. 



He will be admitted to the vascular surgery service, be placed on systemic heparin, and will undergo angiogram in the next 1-2 days for possible angioplasty/stent.



Plan:

-          Systemic anticoagulation w/ IV heparin, bolus 3000 units followed by drip at 1000 units/hr

-          Home meds

-          NPO past midnight

-          Mucormyst/bicarbonate for renal protection given creatinine 1.99

-          Plan for likely angiogram tomorrow, 8/12/05



This patient was discussed with Dr. Francis Pratt, Vascular Surgery Fellow.

SICU visit (Hamilton 04239)

8/26/05 11 45 pm


74 yo male with a history of CAD, PVD s/p right femoral to above knee popliteal bypass with PTFE (5/00) and recent admission for RLE angioplasty X 22 who presents with R foot rest pain and discoloration and underwent fem pop bypass graft. The case was complicated by large blood loss anemia and hypotension.  In the PACU the patient continued to be hypotensive and have low uop. We placed a central line (starting CVP was 0) and continued resuscitation. The patient developed ST changes and also had acute on chronic renal failure (RIFLE F). WE transfused and transferred him to the ICU.  We discussed this at length with the surgical service as well as cardiology.
 
I examined the patient reviewed the chart and discussed the case. I agree with history and exam as outlined in residents note
 
Issues:
Cardiac ischemia:  Ischemia was mostly due to hypotension and low HGB as well as tachycardia .  Will give aspirin and lower HR to 70's with Beta blockers. Contue statin.  Willt ransfuse to HGB around 10 and continue to check troponins
 
Decreased myocardial function: he has low central venous saturation and increased lactate . Will give fluids and transfuse the patient.  Will get echo in am. If his central venous sat  and lactate does not signficantly improve with these measures would stay away from inotropes for now given his rate related ischemia
 
Acute blood-loss naemia: will transfuse to 
 
Metabolic acidosis: the patetin has signifcant metabolic acidosis. We will for now give volume. 
 
Acute renal failure: He has significantly decreaed uop. We are sending  urine lytes and casts. Will increase filling pressures. For now would not use furosemide given low central filling pressures.

NAME:     Oliver, Uriah 
MRN:       7916007

Primary Care Provider:  Dr. Patterson

Mr. Oliver returns for follow-up of several issues.

Weight 175.  Blood pressure 130/80. 

MEDICATIONS:   He finished Flagyl last night, and he took his last dose of levoflox
today.  Glyburide is on hold.  He is taking hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d., Lovastatin
20 mg q.d., fosinopril 40 mg q.d., verapamil SR 240 mg q.d., ASA 1 q.d., metoprolol
75 mg three times a day and Glucophage 1000 mg b.i.d.  

(1)  Diverticulitis and history of colon cancer.  

     S:   His pain is gone although he continues to have a bad taste in his mouth
          since he has been on antibiotics. 

     O:   His abdomen is soft with normal bowel sounds.  There is no tenderness
          today.  

     P:   He will need colonoscopy at the Atlantic North in a month or so. 

(2)  Diarrhea.  

     S:   He has continued to have several soft, dark bowel movements a day
          while he has been taking the antibiotic.  He has not seen any bright red
          blood per rectum.  He has been using Equal and eating ice cream.  

     O:   Stool for C. diff. and stool C&S were both negative. 

     P:   I asked him to discontinue artificial sweeteners and milk products,
          except for yogurt, for 3 days.  He will call if the diarrhea persists off the
          antibiotic.  

(3)  Guaiac-positive stool on examination last week.  

     O:   His hematocrit had increased to 35.7 last week.  

     P:   Recheck CBC.  He will bring me the name of his GI physician at the
          Atlantic North so that I can communicate with him about the recent events
          and arrange for follow-up colonoscopy.  

(4)  Dizziness.  

     S:   This has resolved. 

(5)  Diabetes. 

     S:   He stopped glyburide as directed last week when his 4 p.m. blood sugar
          was 44.  His fingerstick blood sugar was 192 this morning.  He reports
          that he is eating much better.  

     P:   He will restart glyburide 5 mg q.d. when his blood sugar is greater than
          200.

(6)  Systolic murmur and right bundle branch block.

     P:   His echocardiogram has been requested but he has not yet received the
          appointment.  

(7)  Coronary artery disease.  

     S:   He has had no chest pain.  He apparently had an appointment last week
          for an exercise tolerance test at the Atlantic North but the technician was
          not there.  He has another appointment later this week with the doctor
          at the Atlantic North.

     P:   I gave him a copy of the final NYSH discharge summary from his recent
          hospitalization as well as copies of the EKGs done during the
          hospitalization and a copy of the abdominal CT report to take to his
          doctor at the Atlantic North.

(8)  Proteinuria during the hospitalization. 

     O:   His serum creatinine was 1.5 (likely elevated given his age).  Repeat
          urinalysis showed 1+ albumin with no other significant abnormalities. 

     P:   Check 24-hour urine for protein and creatinine.  Check serum protein
          electrophoresis and urine immunoelectrophoresis. 

(9)  Chronic anemia.  

     O:   He had normal iron studies, B12 and folate several months ago.  His
          hematocrit was stable as of last week.  

     P:   Check serum protein electrophoresis and urine immunoelectrophoresis.  

(10) Decreased HDL.  

     A:   We could either add niacin or change his statin from Mevacor to Lipitor
          to increase the HDL.  

     P:   I have deferred this issue to his primary care physician. 

He will return for follow-up in 2 weeks so that we can make final arrangements for
the colonoscopy and to check progress with his diabetes.

Source: Patient and Medical Notes



CC: SOB, DOE x 5 days



HPI: This is a 73yo male w/ a complicated PMH that includes HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia, CAD, and a past MI, which resulted in the placement of an AICD, who now p/w severe SOB and DOE.  Five days PTA, the Pt became SOB while walking up the stairs to his apartment on the 3rd floor.  He took a SL NG pill which he says alleviated the SOB and allowed him to continue.  Over the next few days, his SOB became progressively worse and occurred at rest.  His SOB would awaken him from his sleep, occurring 3-4x/ night.  He states that SL NG pills alleviated his PND.  The Pt sleeps on one pillow.  During the course of his worsening SOB, his exercise tolerance decreased from a baseline of walking 2.5 hours without any SOB to walking for 1.5 hours with multiple stops due to SOB.  These episodes of SOB were not associated w/ CP (pleuritic or otherwise), palpitations, F/C, N/V, diaphoresis, abdominal discomfort, or pain in his arms or jaw.  



Also during this time, the Pt noted progressive b/l swelling of his legs (from ankles to knees) and increasing abdominal girth.  He states that his legs would pit when he pressed on them.  The LE swelling were not associated w/ calf pain.  On the day before admission, however, he did develop a non-productive, dry cough.  On the DOA, his Sx had worsened to the point where he felt like he needed to be seen by a doctor.  He was subsequently driven to NYSH-East by his wife and son, where he was seen and then re-directed to NYSH.     



At NYSH-East, the Pt's vitals were: T 97.6 P 52-55 BP 167/77 O2Sat 98% Wt 188.5# w/ clothes.

The Pt received Lasix 40mg IV and O2 @ 3L/min.



At NYSH-Ed, the Pt's vitals were: P 48 BP 157/78 RR 20 O2Sat 99% on 2L

The Pt received ASA 325mg PO. 

Since receiving the Lasix, the Pt's LE edema has drastically diminished, and the Pt states that he feels a lot better.



The Pt has not experienced any recent weight loss and is on a regular diet without salt restriction (he uses salt 2-3x/wk).  He also claims that he is adherent to taking his meds.

EKG:   NSR, bradycardia (54bpm), LAE, TW-flattening in V5,V6. Biphasic TW in V2-V4. LVH by voltage criteria.  No difference from past EKGs.



CXR FINDINGS:

	Cardiac AICD projecting over the left hemithorax, unchanged. Lung fields are clear. 

Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Right sided diaphragmatic hernia, unchanged. Bony 

thorax is unchanged.



No evidence of active cardiopulmonary disease. 



Echo (6/93):  EF 60%, symmetric LVH



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 73yo male w/ a complicated PMH that includes HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia, CAD, and a past MI, which resulted in the placement of an AICD, who now p/w SOB.

	

PE - This is still possible given the lack of diagnostic studies to rule out.  Although, there were no 

CP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs.  Consider D-dimer to rule out recent PE.   

	Ischemia  - EKG and the negative set of cardiac enzymes x2 does not suggest this. However, Pt 

has not had any acute Sx while on the floor. 

PNA - This is less likely given the lack of fever or elevated WBC.

Tumor - This is also less likely given the lack of weight loss, the acute nature of the symptoms, 

and the lacko f lymphadenopathy.



1)	SOB - Most likely CHF>PE/DVT>ischemia>>PNA,tumor; however, he currently appears asymptomatic. PE is still possible given the lack of diagnostic studies to rule out, although there were no CP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs, and the onset was not acute.  The Pt may have had an exertional ischemia but the lack of CP and EKGs changes makes this less likely; however, the Pt has been asymptomatic on the floor and so no EKG tracings concomitant with the SOB are available to completely rule out this possibility.  PNA and tumor are less likely given the lack of fevers and chills and any hx of weight loss.  



Will start the Pt on O2 in addition to his normal medicinal regimen of diuretics, beta-blockers, and ACE-I.  Will consider the addition of spironolactone.  Order echo to determine EF and to identify structural myocardial changes if any.  Order LFT's to check for decreased perfusion to vital organs.  Monitor UOP for kidney functions.  Monitor EKG for any changes.  Will send for a D-dimer to r/o recent PE. 



2)	HTN - Poorly controlled, may be 2o to missing meds today. Will also be treated using meds for CHF.

3)	DM - Sugars elevated.  Will treat w/ his home medication of glucophage and glyburide.

4)	Hyperlipidemia - Stable. Cont home medication of Lipitor.

5)	FEN - Switch to low salt diet with no concentrated sweet.  Consider a diabetic diet as well.

6)	Dispo - Will d/c once Pt is stabilized.

Pager:  20243









12/10/94 Intern addendum:



Patient seen and examined with med student above.  Agree with overall assessment above.  Briefly:



This is a 73M with a hx of CAD s/p MI, s/p AICD, IDDM, HTN, and hyperlipidemia, who presents with DOE, PND and bilateral leg edema x4 days.  DOE is not associated with anginal symptoms including CP, nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis, although the patient reports it is relieved by nitroglycerine.  Physical exam findings here are notable for a flat JVP, absence of crackles, 2/6 SEM at LLSB and apex, and mild, symmetric, pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities.  Per chart notes, in clinic he was noted to have bulging neck veins.  



Favor CHF >?pacer malfunction, ischemia > PE.  CHF is a somewhat confusing picture as symptoms suggest L-sided failure with pulmonary edema while there is little objective data (no crackles on exam, CXR clear) to suggest this.  Prior to our evaluation he received 40 of IV Lasix and diuresed at least one liter (with subjective improvement), which may account for this discrepancy.  



Plan is for echo to evaluate his LV function, pacer interrogation, and stress.  D-dimer should be sufficient to pursue PE as this is a low-prob possibility.

Interim History:	

Comes to review her medical problems.

Has been feeling well. 



Home Blood Tests:  Records downloaded from meter with little detail and somewhat scattered BS.

B 	57-448

L	71-222

S	101-254

HS	163-399

No food records. No severe hypoglycemia. Has had a couple of nocturnal reactions. There are not enough data points to determine whether the Lantus dose is appropriate.



Retinopathy:	Saw Dr. Aragon over the spring. Has had extensive laser in the past, and had some last year OS after her surgery.

Nephropathy:	Her creatinine was stable at 1.3 in July

Neuropathy:	Feet are not bothering her. Sometimes has a peculiar diffuse tingling sensation precipitated by motion. 

Cardiac:	No chest pain. No unusual dyspnea on exertion. Has been able to exercise in the gym twice a week, walking steadily at a pretty fast pace for an hour. 

Vascular:	No claudication



Past Medical History: 

Medications: no significant changes

Immunizations. Has not had flu shot yet this year. Had the second of hepatitis A series in L deltoid today.



Review of Systems: above

Breast: Saw Dr. Bruce a few weeks ago. Ultrasound showed what is being interpreted as a stable slightly enlarge intramammary lymph node. She find the lower part of the sternotomy scar to be very uncomfortable in most bras and wants to consider whether it can be improved.

Gyn: Overdue to see Yareli Kilgore; she will make the appointment.

Skin: Has noted some crusting lesions on her scalp.



Physical Exam:	

Looks well. In very good spirits. Jake is with her.

BP:   134/80		P:   72	Seated

Skin:	Crusting lesion on scalp



Impressions and Plan:	

Hard to assess control. She is reluctant to keep hand records.

Will try to add an ACE inhibitor again. Start captopril 6.25 mg bid and increase the 12.5 mg bid if tolerated. Check BP at home.

She would like to consider treatment for onychomycosis. Would suggest that Dr. Xie send a paring for fungal culture before we consider it. Also, LFTs were slightly abnormal in July and will need to be repeated. Finally, would have to check medication incompatibilities before proceeding.

Refer to Dr. xia for consideration of modification of her sternotomy scar. Warned her that he may not feel that it is a good idea either on pure surgical grounds on because of her immunosuppression, but it is worth asking his opinion.

Refer to Dr. Keeler for evaluation of scalp lesions.

Flu shot R deltoid with usual preamble. Aventis Fluzone Lot L5317YR. Exp. 7/10/76.

A1c, SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, Bili T/D, Electrolytes, BUN/Creatinine 

Electrolytes, BUN/Creatinine again in 1 month if she is taking captopril at that time.

Interim History:	

Comes to review his medical problems.



Hip X-Rays may have shown early degenerative changes. Still has pain from them on a daily basis but it is minor. Has not tried any analgesics, even acetaminophen. 

Shoulders have bothered her for years and she has seen Dr. Baird with diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis. Hands have bothered her in the past but do not currently. 



A1c has been over 9 % and she says that control has not changed. Does not have records but says that she tests about tid.

Retinopathy:	Saw Dr. Aragon a few weeks ago. Now going only yearly. Last laser was about 2.5 years ago. Reports that vision was 20/20 in one eye and 20/25 in the other.

Nephropathy:	Cr was 1.4 in July. Says that transplant clinic wanted her to return a month after the last visit but she did not want to do so. She thinks that it was for follow-up of an elevated WBC. However, her WBC has been normal over the last several visits. 

Neuropathy:	Not consistent with taking the Neurontin, and notes it she misses it.

Cardiac:	No chest pain or unusual dyspnea on exertion. Does feel out of shape if she climbs    100 stairs   .  She is seeing Dr. Dotson in two weeks.

January 29, 2077



Interim History:	

Comes to review her medical problems.

Her ETT showed mild distal anterior and antero-apical ischemia. The last p-CABG ETT was done in September, 2074, and did not included nuclear images. The electrocardiographic portion of both tests was considered to be uninterpretable because of inadequate elevation of the heart rate. Dr. Dotson asked her to double the atenolol dose. Since she has had low BP in the past, we increased it to only 25/12.5. BP 80/50-90/60 at home and she has not felt so well, tired. Not sure whether the dyspnea on exertion that led us to get the ETT has changed since she has not challenged it. 



Home Blood Tests:  Not very good by history. A1c over 9%. She still has trouble focusing on it. 

Retinopathy:	Visions stable.

Nephropathy:	Cr slightly up to 1.5

Cardiac:	above

Reduce the captopril to 6.25 mg bid.

Report back BP; may have room to go up to 25 mg bid on the atenolol.

She does have some hypoglycemia and symptoms are sometimes subtle. Stressed the likely greater difficulty in perceiving hypoglycemia on beta blockers.

Hard to assess control without data. Hopefully her weight loss does not reflect terrible control.
BP much too high. Start Toprol 25 mg qd.
I have no objection to switch to simvastatin from atorvastatin for  cost reasons, but she must check with the transplant MDs re: this switch because of Neoral interaction with statins.
Her chest pain does not sound particularly cardiac but will ask Dr. Dotson whether he wants any further evaluation. 
MUST     see Dr. Aragon, see transplant MD. Make these appointments for her today.
Will get barium swallow because of her dysphagia - ? disorganized esophageal contractions; consider manometry with Dr. Quam.
A1c, Electrolytes, BUN/Creatinine, Ca, P, A/G, 25-(OH) vitamin D, PTH, CBC, urinalysis. Has already taken her Neoral today.
Fasting lipids another day.
Stool guaiacs. Has not done them.

Appointments:	NP 1 week to check BP
	Me 3 months

Interim History:	

Comes to review her medical problems.

She has been well overall but has been bothered by trigger finger (R ring). She has seen Dr. Ibarra, who has suggested surgery since a steroid injection did not help.

Brings no test results. No severe hypoglycemia.

Retinopathy:	Saw Dr. Aragon yesterday. Stable. Last laser was about 5 years ago. 1 year.

Nephropathy:	Reports that she cannot do blood tests at KJH since she gets copays. Covered if done at Promptcare. She does not recall when her BUN/Cr were last checked but says that it was prior to January and that results were sent to Dr. Hayes. 

Neuropathy:	Not much troubled by neuropathy.  She still has the sensation of food or liquid getting stuck mid sternal level. BaS last year showed GERD and dysmotility. I am not sure that Reglan would help, but have reluctance to try it in any case because of her long history of depression. 

Cardiac:	She thinks that she may be having dyspnea on exertion that is easier to precipitate than it had been. She has had some sternal discomfort at rest on two occasions while sitting at rest - felt bony. She says that she has been    trying to ignore    the possible increase in dyspnea on exertion. She sees Dr. Dotson in October. 

Vascular:	No claudication



Past Medical History: 

Medications: Stopped Quinine; increased Celexa. Did not start simvastatin since did not have blood work done. 



Social History:

Ivory is well. 



Review of Systems: above

Skin: Saw colleague of Dr. Keeler yesterday. Given cream for scalp.

Gyn: Report that Yareli Kilgore will no longer see her for routine follow-up. Periods are regular. Does not use contraception. Has never been pregnant. Discussed this and she left it that she is not worried about it.



Physical Exam:	

Looks well.

BP:   120/76		P:   82, regular

Wt:   161.5 without shoes, stable

HEENT:	Anicteric. 

Carotids:	Normal pulses, without bruits

Chest:	Clear to auscultation

Breasts:	No masses; no nodes	

Nodes:	No cervical, supraclavicular, axillary

Heart:	Normal S1; physiologic S2.  S4.  2/6 systolic ejection murmur

Abdomen:	No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses. No tenderness. No palpable AAA. 

Extremities:	No edema.        DP 1-2+,=.  PT absent.   L great toenail appears to be about to be lost, thickened with probable subungual hematoma.

Neurological:	AJ absent.  



Impressions and Plan:	

Will get ETT with imaging. Need approval from her insurance. Call if she has any more convincing cardiac symptoms.

She should see Yareli Holcomb, NP for Pap with history of HPV and abnormal Paps in the past. 

She should see Dr. Xie for foot care. 

Strongly suggest she get some labs in the next week or so, fasting:

A1c, lipids, Electrolytes, BUN/Creatinine, CBC, SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, Bili T/D, urinalysis





Appointments:	Yareli Holcomb, NP as above

	Me 4 months

Team 1b Medical Intern Admission Note



Pt:	Jasso, Stephen

MR#: 	 7990698

Date of Admission:  7/05/95

Attending: 	I. Ellsworth



CC:  Vertigo, EKG changes



HPI:  73   yo with h/o of DM, CAD s/p anteroseptal MI (2091) and stent placement presents with 2 days of vertigo, most prominent upon wakening in the a.m.  He reports feeling as if he is spinning while the room is stable; this sensation is worsened by changes in position or head movement.  It diminishes only slightly as the day progresses.  He denies any numbness, weakness, tingling, changes in vision or memory.  He denies any recent URI.  He does report tinnitus which has been present intermittently for years as well as bilateral sensorineural hearing secondary to gunshot exposure.  No NV. The sensation of vertigo is superimposed upon one week of gradually progressive loss of balance, described as not knowing where to put his limbs in relation to space.  He also reports ~7 days of mild diarrhea in a.m only, attributable to eating sorbitol ice cream as well as continuing to take Metamucil for the same 7 day period.  Diarrhea has been fully resolved for 2 days PTA. He does report good PO fluid intake, ~8 bottles of H20 per day.  He monitors his sugars regularly and reports they have been running in the 110-140s. He denies any fevers, chills, sweats or sick contacts.  The patient does have ptosis on the L and reports that this has been present less than one month.  He has had no changes in medications.



Additionally, the patient reports one episode of fleeting chest pain along the midaxillary line on 07/12 which was relieved immediately by NTG.  (Pt attributes the pain to gas as the belching coincident with the NTG also seemed to relieve the pain).  He does also report an increase in SOB after walking up one flight of stairs which has arisen over the past few months.

Labarynthitis less likely as there is no antecedent infection or associated nausea.  Given multiple risk factors central process such as stroke will image brain.  Vertigo combined with loss of balance, although not elicited on exam, may represent vertebrobasilar insufficiency.  EKG changes concerning for ventricular aneurysm v. anteroseptal reinfarction if viable tissue still remains.  ROMI and Echo in a.m.

Major Problems



Diabetes mellitus (adult onset)

Aug 13

S: Has history of DM2 for 20(+)years c/b peripheral neuropathy for which Mr. Jacobs takes amytriptyline with good effect. He has a hx of iritis and retinitis recently treated with steroids.  He follows-up with the Rusk State opthamologists. For foot care he sees a podiatrist at the RSH as well. There is no history of diabetic ulcer or cellulitis. He is maintained on glyburide 2.5mg for several years and he checks his BS qd with range of 100-150 and occasional episodes of hypoglycemia. His last AIC was 4.4% in 9/95. At this time his UA showed no proteinuria and his renal function is within normal limits. He is on an ACEi. His diabetic care is well managed at the Diabetic clinic by Whitney Bullock. 

P: c/w glyburide and current endocrine/optho/podiatry care.



Atherosclerotic coronary vascular disease

S: Mr. Jacobs has a hx of anteroseptal MI in 2092 and is s/p left main stent placement. In July of 2095, he had a TTE which was remarkable for an EF of 23%, reduced from 31% in 2092. Also notable for anteroseptal AK and infero-posterior HK. AD-MIBI in 9/95 with anteroseptal scar, but no ischemia. Does about 30 minutes of aerobic physical activity each morning without issue. No CP or SOB. Denies orthopnea, PND, LE edema. 

P: DM (AIC 4.4) and lipid control (LDL 59) is optimal. Medical Regimen consists of  ASA, BB, ACEi, Statin. Is a patient of Dr. Dunham and plan to see him annually. I wonder if he should be anticoagulated given his diffuse HK and whether he should be considered for BiV pacing.





Health maintenance

CAD: please see problem list

Tob: quit 25 years ago

EtOH: neg 

Exercise: intensive exercise regimen, but limited as of late by neuropathy 

Diet: eats fruits/vegetables; minimal salt, fatty foods    

Colon CA: Spring 2095 with normal colonoscopy

Prostate CA: next due for prostate exam in 7/96. Documented more than once in recent inpatient stay as non-enlarged, no nodules. PSA checked at RSH and is nl per patient. Will request RSH records. 

Seatbelts: y 

Sunscreen: y 

Vaccines: gets tetanus/pneumo at RSH (2095) and flu shot in the fall.



Anemia

History of Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia. Had Hct checked in April and it was 37. Is not light-headed, short of breathe, and denies any chest pain.



Allergies

Allergy   Gets rash with acetaminophen

ID/CC:75 YO M with chest pain 	







HPI: 

This pleasant 75 YO M presents today after multiple episodes of sharp L anterior chest pain. The first episode started this AM (10AM). It was left sided with out radiation non positional or pleuritic. Denies any associated sx such as palpitations, SOB, n,v. Although he has had a mild cough with throat irratation over the past few days.  He was attributing this pain to gas but he took an aspirin and (expired) nitroglycerine SL just in case. He had an anteroseptal MI in 2092 and when questioned he does not feel this pain is similar to his prior attack.  Later that day he had another episode of pain for which he felt more worried about, called the EMS for evaluation of a cardiac cause of his pain. On route to the Hospital the EMS gave SL nitro which relieved the pain. He was evaluated in the ED where he had EKG, cardiac enzymes and was given his normal dose of beta blocker. His EKG when compared showed evidence of his old anterior septal MI, possibly slightly inverted T waves in I,AVL and deeper T wave  inversions in V1-3. 

First 2 sets of cardiac enzymes have been normal and he has remained CP free since the last nitro. 



ROS:   No F/C/NS.  No change in weight/appetite. No Palpitations/Orthopnea/PND/LE edema/Claudication. No SOB/cough/hemoptysis/wheezing/sore throat/rash.  No N/V/D/hematochezia/melena.

NAME:     Hendrickson, Ora 

MRN:      7194334



This patient is here for a follow-up.  She was seen with a very complete evaluation 

by Ida Oquinn for her recurrent urinary tract infections.  She submitted a

urine sample initially that appeared fairly clean but then after straight cathing her

urine Ida was able to obtain cloudy foul smelling urine.  A fair amount retained

as postvoid residual.  Ms. Hendrickson completed her 14 days of Levaquin with

resolution of her symptoms but now over the past few days she has noticed an odor

and cloudiness to her urine again without fevers of dysuria or urinary urgency.  She

has anxiety associated with the possible reasons why she should have recurrent

infections.  She is most concerned about having cancer.  She is scheduled to see Dr.

Quezada March 24th.  The patient reports increased anxiety of late as there have

been issues going around the housing projects.  A 14-year-old girl was raped and

one week later an individual was climbing a tree to try to get into her apartment. 

She ended up combating him with a broom and he ran away.  She did not file a

police report.  As a result of this she has had more problems with her anxiety.  She

reports compliance with all her medications except that she ran out of her Lasix

approximately one week ago.  She had been taking 20 mg one-half to one tablet

sporadically but not on a regular basis.  She denies any chest pressure or

palpitations.  She denies any shortness of breath.  She denies any problems with

pain in her right foot or increased swelling of her left ankle.



PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure is 156/90.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm. 

No murmurs, gallops or rubs.  UA reveals positive nitrate and 2+ leukocytes.  Her

ankle reveals trace edema on the left.  Her right extremity is warm to palpation.  



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



(1)  Hypertension.  Blood pressure has been high over the past two visits.  This

     may be due to the fact that she has not been taking her Lasix.  I have

     restarted her on the Lasix 20 mg to take one-half tablet q.d. on a regular

     basis.  



(2)  Anxiety.  I will write a letter for her to the Rupert Housing Council to try

     to get her moved out of this current housing project to a safer environment.



(3)  Recurrent urinary tract infections.  She had a urine culture submitted today. 

     She was given another prescription for Levaquin 150 mg one PO q.d.  She

     will stay on this until her appointment with Dr. Quezada.  I attempted to

     reassure her that it is unlikely that cancer is the cause for her current

     recurrent infections.  It is more likely due to her cystocele.



(4)  Peripheral vascular disease.  This appears stable.  She remains off the

     cigarettes.  



(5)  ASCVD.  She remains without symptoms.  



(6)  GERD.  She remains on the Prilosec.



(7)  Hyperlipidemia.  She remains on Lipitor.  She should have a repeat

     cholesterol obtained with a new primary care physician in the fall.



(8)  Borderline high sugar.  The patient should also have this rechecked with the

     new physician in the fall.

CC/HPI:



Pt is 76 yo F with h/o CAD, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, COPD, many pack-years of smoking, and anxiety who presents with c/o SOB.



Pt was in her usual state of health about 1 week PTA, when she noticed gradually worsening SOB and developing cough productive of scant whitish sputum.  She had no fevers/chills, prior URI symptoms/sick contacts, CP/lightheadedness, N/V/abdominal pain, diaphoresis, increasing leg swelling, or orthopnea/PND symptoms.  She thought she might be developing    bronchitis,    discontinued smoking and called her PCP to ask for antibiotics.  She was told to come to the clinic but her SOB progressively worsened in the few hours PTA, and she called for EMS to go to the ED. 



In ED:  

a. Lasix 40 mg IV x2, NTG paste    initial SOB improvement, small UO;

b. Lasix 40 mg IV x 2    improved, ready for floor transfer but develops an episode of worsening SOB/flush pulmonary edema on CXR;

c. Lasix 160mg IV    Morphine 3mg IV + CPAP    Atrovent/Albuterol    Zaroxylin 5mg + Lasix 200mg IV     improved, on Hi-Flow O2; total UO: 1,100cc.

EKG:	old LBBB, no acute ischemic changes 



CXR: cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusions



ADENOSINE MIBI (6/89): The ECG response to pharmacological stress was negative for

 ischemia. Images demonstrated a small posterobasal infarction

 associated with mild to moderate inferior ischemia.  Comparison to

 2084 is difficult due to the difference of technique.  However,

 septal ischemia is no longer present in the current study and

 inferior ischemia is still present.



ECHO (6/89): mild mitral regurgitation; LA dilated; 

- trans-aortic gradient ~13 mm HG/no stenosis; 

- LV imildly dilated, w/segmental LV dysfunction [inferior wall]; EF 68 %;

- trace tricuspid insufficiency

- trace pulmonary insufficiency; RV 34 mmHg/ not dilated







A/P: Pt is a 76 yo F with multiple cardiac risk factors who presents with CHF exacerbation. Ddx of precipitants include new myocardial ischemia, hypertensive crisis, medication non-compliance/misadministration, arrhythmia, or infection.  Even though MI would be the most worrisome to follow through with, a simple trigger such as COPD exacerbation cannot be excluded.  



-	continue HF O2, ASA, cardiac enzymes to r/o MI

-	tight BP control w/ CCB and ACEI as needed; may use TNG/Hydralazine

(will hold BB during the acute exacerbation)

-	Lasix IV prn; strict I/Os [admission wt 180#)

-	Low-sodium diet/consider fluid restriction

-	Repeat CXR/EKG

-	Azithromycin 250mg po/Albuterol/Atrovent nebs

-	ECHO in AM/consider ETT/Cardiology: Dr Garner

CC/RFA:  SOB.



HPI: Pt is a 76 yo F with a h/o CAD, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, COPD, CHF who developed acute SOB while at home PM of admission. Pt reports no dietary discretions and excellent adherence to medications. She was out evening of admission at a social gathering and noticed symptoms when she returned home and had difficulty climbing an internal staircase in her home She ascended the staircase and was unable to regain her breath. She reports she developed profound dyspnea and tachycardia. She denies chest pain, diaphoresis, dizziness or LOC. She has had a cough productive of clear sputum x 1 week with no fever, night sweats, rigors or chills during this time. She has had no vomiting or diarrhea. She does not recall wheezing, and asserts the only symptoms during the episode consisted in SOB and tachypnea.



Of note, pt had 2 vessel CABG in 11/92. Catheterization on 11/18/92 revealed 100% obstruction of the left proximal circ, 70% proximal LAD obstruction, and 100% obstruction of the mid RCA. 



Course in ED:

En route to BBH pt received Lasix 40 mg, TNG x 3. She was described as pale, cool, and diaphoretic. She was unable to complete full sentences. She received Lasix 40 mg IV and 20 mg IV 2 hours later, ASA 325 x 1, Zofran 8 mg IV, and 0.5     nitropaste. Initial vitals were T 98 P 93 BP 148/67  RR 24  93 % on 6 L and 100% on BiPap (brief).

Wall Motion Abbreviations: N=Normal H=Hypokinetic A=Akinetic D=Dyskinetic



MITRAL VALVE

There is calcification of the posterior mitral annulus.  There is no evidence

of mitral valve prolapse.  There is mild mitral regurgitation by color and

spectral Doppler.



LEFT ATRIUM

The left atrium is dilated.



AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT

There is thickening of the bases of multiple aortic leaflets.  The aortic

valve is tricuspid.  There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or

spectral Doppler.  There are irregular echoes along the aortic wall c/w

atheroma.



LEFT VENTRICLE

The left ventricular cavity size is normal.  The left ventricular systolic

function is impaired.  There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.  There

is segmental left ventricular dysfunction (see wall motion plot).  This

involves the lateral,inferior and apical territory.  There is a false tendon

within the LV cavity which is a normal variant.  The estimated ejection

fraction is 33 %.



TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC

There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of trace tricuspid insufficiency.



PULMONARY VALVE, INFUND., P.A.

There is evidence of trace pulmonary insufficiency by color and spectral

Doppler.



RIGHT VENTRICLE

The right ventricle is not dilated.  The right ventricular systolic function

is within normal limits.



PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES

There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion.  There is increased

intrapericardial pressure without evidence of frank tamponade.  There is

diffuse fibrin deposition on the visceral pericardium.  There is evidence of a

pleural effusion.



CONCLUSIONS

Compared to the report of 6/5/2089,the left ventricular systolic function is

impaired with new wall motion abnormalities. Also a new pericardial effusion

is visualized.

The resident's history, physical examination, and evaluation

reviewed by me and I concur.  In addition, I personally

interviewed and examined this patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old female who

presents for evaluation of chest pain.  The patient had no

history of coronary artery disease until the last week.  She was

apparently in Pennsylvania where she had been for the last week.  She

had been having 5 days of epigastric and substernal discomfort. 

She considered it to be indigestion and have been taking Tums. 

After approximately 5 days while in Pennsylvania, she felt that the

discomfort was not improving.  She did feel like that she had

less energy for her usual activity.  She went to a hospital there

in her land of Pennsylvania where she was noted to have a positive

troponin.  She underwent a diagnostic catheterization that did

show multivessel disease with an occluded LAD.  She subsequently

underwent a therapeutic PCI with stenting of her LAD.  She did

have recurrent chest pain today after catheterization, which was

much more severe, sharper in nature per her description.  She was

told in the hospital in Pennsylvania that this was due to reperfusion.

 She returned home today, called her primary care physician and

was advised to come to the Emergency Department for evaluation. 

She does state that since discharge from the hospital in Pennsylvania

earlier this week, she has had intermittent episodes of more

severe left anterior chest pain, which she describes as somewhat

more sharp than the indigestion feeling she was experiencing

before.  It is not always associated with exertion.  It sometimes

radiates to her left shoulder.  It is not pleuritic in nature. 

It seems to be intermittent, although she does have a low level

of dull aching pain, which has been fairly constant since her

discharge from Pennsylvania.  She denies any shortness of breath.  She

is able to lie flat.  Denies any lower extremity edema.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive for type 1 diabetes, which is

fairly brittle per her report.  She is status post MI within the

last week.  She also has a remote history of PE in the past and

is no longer on Coumadin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke.  She lives with her husband

and has recently returned from Pennsylvania.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and is also positive for CAD.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  All other systems are reviewed and are also

negative except per the HPI.

MEDICATIONS:  Include insulin, Plavix, aspirin, Nexium, Lipitor,

and atenolol.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has allergies to iodine and Indocin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature is 98.6, her pulse 65,

respirations 18, and blood pressure 105/69.  The patient is

awake, alert, pleasant female who is reclining in no acute

distress.  Her head examination is normocephalic and atraumatic. 

Her pupils are equal and reactive to light.  Her sclerae are

anicteric.  Her conjunctivae are pink and moist.  She has moist

mucous membranes and appears well hydrated.  Her neck is supple

and nontender with full range of motion.  The JVP is not

elevated.  Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with

equal breath sounds, no respiratory distress.  No accessory

muscle use and no chest wall tenderness.  Her cardiac examination

is regular rate and rhythm with no murmur, rub, or gallop.  Her

abdomen is nondistended, soft, and nontender.  No guarding, no

peritoneal signs, and no organomegaly.  Her skin is intact, warm,

dry, and slightly pale.  There are no rashes.  Her back is

nontender with full range of motion.  Extremities reveal no

cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  Her calves are soft and nontender

with no palpable cords and full range of motion with normal

strength and tone.  She is alert and oriented x3, very pleasant. 

Cranial nerves are intact, and there is no motor or sensory

deficit.  Rectal examination performed by the resident reveals

heme-negative stool with normal tone.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was placed on a cardiac

monitor.  IV access was maintained.  Laboratory studies were sent

and EKG was also ordered.  Her prior records from Pennsylvania were

reviewed.  Her white blood cell count is 8.4, hematocrit 37, and

platelets 285,000.  Her electrolytes are within normal limits. 

Her BUN is 18, creatinine 0.8, and glucose 112.  Her CK here

returned normal at 33.  Her MB was 0.4.  Her troponin returned

elevated at 0.39.  This is in comparison to the troponin from her

records of Pennsylvania, which was 0.2.  Her d-dimer is less than 200.

 Her INR is 1.1.  The patient had an EKG, which showed evidence

of a new T-wave inversions, present on prior EKG from this

hospital.  She was started on heparin for concern of unstable

angina status post MI, remained hemodynamically stable, and is

admitted to the Cardiac Service.

DIAGNOSIS:  Chest pain, rule out unstable angina.

DATE OF ADMISSION:  12/06/2085.

This 66-year-old woman phoned my office complaining of exertional chest discomfort.  We instructed her to presented to the Emergency Department at Davis Monthan Hospital.  She had experienced multiple episodes of chest pressure with exertion lasting 5-10 minutes and radiating to her left axilla.

On 10/30/2085, she suffered non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction in Pennsylvania and was managed with percutaneous coronary intervention.

Chest discomfort recurred and on 11/03/2085, she was recatheterized at Davis Monthan Hospital where her mid LAD stent was expanded.

She has had worsening substernal chest discomfort over the past two to three days.  Her discomfort is relieved with nitroglycerin.  Overnight, she had on and off chest discomfort with anterior T-wave lability.  She was placed on intravenous heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin.

She suffered pulmonary embolism in 2074.   That is when I first met her.  She has gastroesophageal reflux disease.

She is married; her husband works at 24 Hour Fitness as a personal trainer in the weight room.  She does not smoke cigarettes.  She has four children.

Home medications include aspirin 325 mg daily, atenolol 25 mg daily, Lipitor 80 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, insulin, and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed.

The review of systems is negative other than the above.

On physical examination, she appears well.  Afebrile, blood pressure 126/82 mmHg, heart rate 72 and regular, and respiratory rate 13 per minute.  HEENT is normal.  The neck veins are not distended.  The chest is clear.  On cardiac examination, she has a regular rhythm with a normal S1, single S2, and no murmur, rub, or gallop.  Abdomen has no masses or hepatomegaly.  The legs have no clubbing or cyanosis, but there is right leg greater than left leg edema.  The skin has no rash.

My assessment is that Irene Zastrow has ""small vessel"" coronary artery disease in addition to epicardial coronary artery disease.  We will intensify her medical regimen by prescribing higher doses of beta blockade and by initiating a long-acting nitrate.  We will also repeat the chest CT scan to make sure she has not suffered from recurrent pulmonary embolism.

I discussed this plan with her, her husband, and the medical house staff.

Dear Iva:



Irene Zastrow, 66 years old, returned for followup of coronary artery disease and non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction that she suffered in Pennsylvania on 10/29/2085.  At that time, she had a drug-eluting stent placed in her left anterior descending coronary artery.  On 11/03/2085, she had repeat percutaneous coronary intervention because of persistent chest pain and required an additional inflation and reexpansion of the drug-eluting stent.  On 12/07/2085, she had repeated cardiac catheterization because of chest pain but no additional percutaneous coronary intervention was required.



She feels that she is having less chest discomfort as we have ""ramped up"" her cardiac medications.  She has no shortness of breath.  She does get occasional abdominal pulsations.  She does get epigastric discomfort.



Current medications include ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, aspirin 325 mg once daily, Plavix 75 mg once daily, isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg once daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, and insulin.



The review of systems is negative other than the above.



On physical examination, she appears well.  Weight 165 pounds, blood pressure 109/73 mmHg, heart rate 77 and regular, respiratory rate 14.  HEENT:  Normal.  The neck veins are not distended.  The chest is clear.  On cardiac examination, she has a regular rhythm with a normal S1, single S2, and no murmur, rub, or gallop.  Abdomen has no masses or hepatomegaly.  The legs have no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  The skin has no rash.



Irene Zastrow is improving from the clinical cardiovascular view point.



I will obtain an exercise treadmill test using the standard Bruce protocol to obtain additional objective data.



Although theoretically she should not have acid secretion due to pernicious anemia, I do suspect she has acid reflux, and I am reinstituting today Prilosec 20 mg twice daily.



I am prescribing physical therapy for her ""stiff neck.""



I am ordering an abdominal ultrasound to exclude abdominal aortic aneurysm due to her complaint of episodic abdominal severe pulsations.



I reassured her and told her she is clinically improving.  I will plan to see her again in about four months.



Best personal regards.



Sincerely yours,

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Zastrow is a 67-year-old woman with type I diabetes who comes in today for followup.  We have had heron the insulin pump now for close to six months and recently she had had continuous blood glucose monitoring.  We had gone over these results over the phone and I had made some adjustments.  Particularly she seems to have some late morning hyperglycemia and we decided to change her carbohydrate to bolus ratio during the morning hours and this has resulted in tremendous improvement in her blood sugars.  She brings them in today and the results look excellent.  She has had no other concerns of late.  We have not tested her hemoglobin A1c in a long period of time, so she comes in today for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for the type I diabetes as described, her pernicious anemia, C6-C7 vertebral degenerative disease, pulmonary embolus and also some mild asthma in the past.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Prior surgeries are complete hysterectomy about 15 years ago and a single oophorectomy.  Prior hospitalizations include her PEs in 2083, her tachycardia in 2083.  She had arthroscopic right knee surgery approximately five years ago and she had four live births.  She is currently in menopause.

MEDICATIONS:  Include Aleve 220 mg b.i.d. p.r.n. pain, aspirin 81 mg daily, calcium 600 mg plus vitamin D, she takes one tablet twice a day, Plavix 75 mg daily, glucagon emergency kit as needed, glucosamine 750 mg b.i.d.  She has recently completed a Cipro course with Dr. Varney for bacterial overgrowth symptoms, Imdur 30 mg daily, Lipitor 20 mg nightly, multivitamin one tablet per day, ranolazine 1 g as directed, Toprol-XL 150 mg daily, vitamin B12 1500 mcg every month, and vitamin D2 1000 mg daily.

ALLERGIES:  Include any iodine product she gets red and itchy skin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke.  She has never smoked.  She drinks alcohol rarely, a glass of wine maybe once a week, one cup of soda with caffeine each day.  She walks for exercise.  Gardening is her major hobby.  She lives with her husband.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Reveals her mother passed away at age 73 with malignancy, father passed away at age 89 with congestive heart failure with five bypasses, sister at age 73 with arthritis, a brother at age 70 with colon cancer and MI, sister age 68 has diabetes and Alzheimers, brother 63 years old in good health.  Paternal grandmother passed away at age 89 and paternal grandfather at 52 from a massive MI.  Paternal grandmother 53 from colon cancer, paternal grandfather at age 89.  She has four children ____ serious medical problems.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise unremarkable except for what is listed already in the HPI.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is generally awake, alert, in no acute distress.  She is 66.5 inches with a weight of 167.5 pounds, which gives her a BMI of 26.7.  Her blood pressure is 110/62 and her pulse is 86.  Generally, she is awake, alert, in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Pupils equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Cranial nerves II through XII are symmetric and intact bilaterally.  Fundi are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No dullness to percussion is present.  Back exam reveals no spinal, paraspinal or CVA tenderness.  Breast examination reveals no masses or galactorrhea.  Cardiovascular exam, PMI in the mid clavicular line, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdominal exam:  Normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly or abdominal masses noted.  Anoscopy did not reveal any hemorrhoids.  Neck exam reveals no jugular venous distention.  Carotids are 2+ with normal upstrokes.  Thyroid is 20 g without nodules.  Extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Neurologically, she is alert and oriented x3 and has a grossly nonfocal exam.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  Ms. Zastrow is a 67-year-old woman who comes in today with review of her type 1 diabetes.  She is doing much better on the pump than she was before especially with the recent adjustments we made.  We will continue with the pump and she will continue to send me her blood sugars every two weeks until we get this under control.  We will check a hemoglobin A1c today.  She is up-to-date with the remainder of her health maintenance including seeing a podiatrist and an ophthalmologist as we had prescribed.
2.  Cardiovascular.  She is doing well on her current regimen.  She is on ranolazine and will continue with this.
3.  Neck pain.  Intermittent neck pain is most likely from degenerative disease.  I did not find anything on neurological exam that was concerning.  I did encourage her to actually take some Naprosyn as needed for this pain, but not to take it on a continuous basis for long periods of time.  She has had some problems with some blood in the stool and I feel that she is due for colonoscopy.  I did recommend that she get one in the near future.  

ADDENDUM:  A pelvic exam was with normal appearing female external genitalia.  Normal vaginal vault, no adnexal fullness felt.  Vaginal Pap was taken.  Greater than 50% of our 60-minute visit was spent going over her pump settings, the appropriate levels for her pump, going over her diet, going over her bowel habits and her etiology of possible blood in her stool.

Dear Fitzgerald:



  I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Haden Doty, in consultation today regarding his peripheral arterial disease and generalized vascular disease.  As you know, he is a patient that has known coronary artery disease, for which I ended up doing a catheterization on 08/27/2157, and that was done because of an abnormal stress test and chest pain.  At that time, he had been evaluated by Dr. Morgan Thayer, who performed a stress MIBI and demonstrated an inferoposterior ischemia, a low workload of 3 minutes and 18 seconds, and a heart rate of only 72% of predicted.  The LV chamber was dilated, and the ejection fraction was estimated at 48%, and there was a suggestion of global ischemia.  The catheterization demonstrated the presence of moderate diffuse coronary artery disease, plaque distributed throughout much of the coronary tree, some calcification, and narrow caliber vessels overall, but no focal high-grade stenoses.  There was some disease in the distal left main coronary artery, but his angina or ischemia was felt to be on the basis of excess demand in the phase of globally diminished supply.



He was treated medically for the coronary artery disease.  At the time of his cath, he also underwent an angiography of his abdominal aorta and selective angiogram of his left leg, because he was complaining of claudication predominantly on the left calf at that time.  That study demonstrated the presence of two renal arteries of the left side, a small superior one that was narrowed by about 50%, and a larger inferior left renal artery that was narrowed by about 60%.  The right side was patent.  With respect to the abdominal aorta, there was an ulcerated plaque just below the superior renal artery, narrowing the channel in the aorta by about 30% or 40%.  The iliac vessels were patent, and the left common femoral artery had some irregularity that was patent.  The left SFA, a diffusely diseased vessel, had a high-grade stenosis of about 80% in the adductor canal.  Then, at the trifurcation, there was occlusion or high-grade stenosis of all three trifurcation vessels on the left side.  There was reconstitution at the level of the ankle.



The decision at that time was made to treat him conservatively, at least for the present, since he was still playing golf three to four times a week.  He also apparently had some other issues, so I never saw him again in followup.  The original plan had been to bring him back for revascularization of his left renal artery and the left SFA.



He did have back surgery about a year ago when he became significantly crippled by his lumbar spinal stenosis.  Dr. Anders Sykes performed an L3-L4, L4-L5 decompressive laminectomy.  This had a dramatically positive effect on his back pain.



The biggest problem now is that he feels that he cannot walk as far and his exercise tolerance has decreased.  He has been an avid golfer in the past, but is now having some more difficulty with that.  Even when I saw him two years ago, he was using a cart to play three or four times a week.  He still is able to play golf, but if he walks about 100 yards, he starts feeling his calves, and now the symptoms are bilateral and equal.  He also has some numbness in his toes, which is constant, and his feet feel cold much of the time.  The symptoms of claudication have increased over the past couple of years.



His blood pressure has been reasonably stable.  He tells me that you get pressures of 120-130.  He has not been taking his blood pressure at home, but he does take a fair amount of medication, see below.



Of note, his son says that when he was in Michigan, he was playing 18 holes of golf regularly, sometimes a couple of times per day, but Haas notes that he was indeed limited by claudication even though he was able to play the golf down in Michigan.  He seems to be more limited up here since returning just a short time ago.  He also says that he feels like he has got to stay on the move, and if he does not play any golf at all, he will really deteriorate.  Of note, the discomfort is not only limited to the calves, but also there is some discomfort in the hips, though not nearly as bad and not as limiting.



Of note, he has been seeing Dr. Youngman for his legs and has been told to ""walk walk walk.""  At this point, he feels that he cannot walk as well or enough to follow through on his instructions.



Past medical history:

   As above.

Others include the following:

1.  Diabetes, type 2.

2.  Hypertension, with blood pressures as high as 220 at times in the past.

3.  Carotid bruits, though I do not have any readings from a Duplex ultrasound that was done a couple of years ago or so.

4.  Hyperlipidemia.

5.  Remote history of smoking, quit 40 years ago or so after 20 years of smoking.

6.  Peripheral neuropathy.

7.  Coronary artery disease, as described.

8.  Renal artery stenosis and PVD.



Current Medications:

  Avandia 4 mg QD

 Prilosec 20 mg QD

 atenolol 150 mg QD

 Imdur 60 mg QD

 lisinopril 40 mg QD

 Lipitor 5 mg QD

 aspirin 325 mg QD

 Tricor 54 mg 1 tab qd

 Norvasc 5 mg QD

 Plavix 75 mg QD

 nitroglycerin PRN

Social history:

   He used to run a catering company.  Currently retired.  Plays golf a lot.  Likes to maintain a high level of activity.  Has two sons, one in Lake Wildwood, another in Baldwin City.  He has a daughter in Michigan.  Grandchildren - several.  He also has a great grandchild.



No smoking currently and only drinks occasional beer.  Occasional cup of coffee.



Review of systems:

   Positive for edema, 1+ in both legs.  He denies neurologic symptoms, sweats, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody stools, or hemoptysis.  He does have night cramps and frequent urination at night.  He says he has some problems with vision with some intermittent blurring of his vision, but no monocular blindness.  He is set up to see an ophthalmologist soon.



Physical examination:

Assessment and plan:

   1.  Obtain MRA of abdominal aorta, renal, and run-off arteries down to the ankle.  This will help give us a road map as to how we can approach revascularization of his legs to make him feel better.  I already know that I can open up his left SFA and probably his left trifurcation vessels below the knee, but I would like to see the right side and also get another look at the aortoiliac vessels, since it has been a full two years.

2.  Continue appropriate risk factor modification as you are doing.

3.  We will obtain blood work today in preparation for revascularization.

4.  I need to get carotid noninvasive studies, since it has been a couple of years anyway.



Impression:

   1.  Peripheral arterial disease - progressive claudication, now involving both legs at an equal amount and limiting him in terms of daily activities.  We know that he has high-grade disease in the left leg, below the groin, which can be treated.  Right leg has not been examined in the past.  Also has an ulcerative plaque in the aorta, which might be best left alone.

2.  Renal vascular disease - known moderately severe stenosis left main and accessory renal arteries.  Blood pressure is under reasonable control.  Need to check his creatinine and BUN.  If they are okay, then we would leave him alone.  He is however on a total of six antihypertensive medications, so consideration of renal artery revascularization is certainly something to entertain.

3.  Coronary artery disease - stable.

4.  Diabetes.

5.  Spinal stenosis - better since back surgery.

MICROBIOLOGY:



Nil current.




RADIOLOGY:



6/25/64 CT ABDO:

There is mild to moderate stenosis of the origins of the celiac and 

     SMA.  The IMA is occluded.  There is a moderate stenosis of the right 

     renal artery origin.  There are two left renal arteries.  The upper 

     renal artery is an accessory muscle and has a mild to moderate 

     stenosis at its origin.  The left renal artery has a high-grade 

     stenosis at its origin.  There is a circumaortic left renal vein.

      

     There is a chronic penetrating ulcer with focal aortic dissection of 

     the visceral segment of the abdominal aorta.  There is a moderate 

     stenosis of the left common iliac artery origin.

      

     The kidneys are unremarkable.

      

     The liver, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. 

     There is no intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal adenopathy.

      

     There is cholelithiasis.  The common bile duct is 2.1 cm in diameter 

     with a probable common duct stone.

      

     There are no bony lytic or blastic lesions.

      

     The visualized lungs are clear. There is centrilobular emphysema, 

     mild.  There are no pleural effusions.

      

     

     IMPRESSION:

      

     1.  Cholelithiasis with a dilated common bile duct and a common duct 

     stone.

      

     2.  No significant mesenteric arterial compromise.  The IMA is 

     occluded.

      

     3.  Stenosis of both left renal arteries, with the larger left renal 

     artery severely stenotic.

      

     4.  Mild to moderate stenosis of the right renal artery.

      

     5.  Chronic penetrating ulcer with focal dissection of the distal 

     segment of the abdominal aorta.

      


5/30/63 CAROTID US:

IMPRESSION


1. Bilateral moderate 50-69% stenosis of the internal carotid arteries.


2. &lt; 50% stenosis noted in the distal left common carotid artery.


3. No significant stenosis in the left external carotid artery.


4. Probable hemodynamically significant stenosis in the right external carotid

  artery.


4. Antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.


5. Normal flow in both subclavian arteries.




PREVIOUS ENDOSCOPIC EVALUATIONS:



Per the patient and his sons he was evalueated &gt;10 yrs ago w/ a colonoscopy which noted a single small benign polyp.



ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN:




87M h/o CAD (3vd), PVD, DM, HTN moderate b/l carotid stenosis, chronic ulcer in the distal ulcer w/ dissection, w/ a dilated CBD and choledocholithiasis for which we are consulted.



We will plan for further evaluation of the patient&#8217;s biliary system with an ERCP. 
Given the location of the largest stone i.e. not impacted with very slight LFT derangement I am concerned for alternative sources of the patient&#8217;s biliary dilation (e.g. pancreatic ca).



I have spoke to the patient and his 2 sons that given his numerous comorbidities in particular his cardiac status and carotid disease that he is at higher risk for complications which they all appreciate.






Recommendations:



-cont cipro/flagyl, if any concerns for decompsenation would add ampicillin also

-IVF

-clear liquids ok until midnight

-NPO from midnight

-neurology consult for risk of GA given carotid artery disease burden

-please confirm with vascular surg ERCP/GA safe given dissection/aortic ulcer present

-patient waitlisted for ERCP w/ GA on 6/27/64

HOLCOMB,DENNIS   833-12-06-0                       VISIT DATE: 05/09/21

This patient was seen, interviewed and examined by myself as well 

as Dr. Petty whose I have reviewed and whose findings I have 

confirmed.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 53-year-old male who 

presents with complaints of palpitations, shortness of breath and a 

general feeling of weakness.  The patient states he has been 

feeling unwell for the past three days and has noticed his heart 

racing.  He actually has had his significant other take his heart 

rate and blood pressure while he was at home, and his readings have 

been in the 1 teens to 120s.  The patient has had a decreased 

appetite with vomiting and nausea as well as chest tightness in his 

mid-chest.  The patient felt himself get worse, and he, therefore, 

presents to the emergency department.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per the written note.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.

MEDICATIONS:  Insulin.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As per the written note.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a well-developed, well-nourished 

male in moderate distress.  Pulse 160-177, respiratory rate 40, 

blood pressure is 130/68, oxygen saturation is 100% on room air.  

NECK:  Supple, full range of motion, no jugular venous distension.  

CARDIAC:  Regular, tachycardic, no murmur is auscultated, clear S1 

and S2.  LUNGS:  Positive rales at the bases, otherwise clear, good 

air movement, tachypneic.  NEURO:  Alert and oriented x 3, follows 

all commands appropriate.  Further details of the exam are as per 

the written note.  

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Labs are significant for a glucose of 322, 

BUN of 31, creatinine of 1.8, bicarbonate of 19, CK of 186, MB of 

4.0, troponin of 1.11, calcium of 9.9.  White count of 15.6, 

hematocrit of 47.6, platelets of 206.  PT of 14.0, PTT of 29.0.  

EKG shows wide complex, regular, tachycardia.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen, interviewed 

and examined in the emergency department with labs obtained and as 

documented above.  In addition to the above studies, the patient 

had a chest x-ray which shows increased pulmonary vasculature.  The 

patient's EKG along with his history is concerning for a 

ventricular tachycardia.  The patient, therefore, initially 

received amiodarone.  The amiodarone affected no change in the 

patient's heart rate.  The patient remained tachypneic and 

tachycardic and generally well appearing.  The decision was made to 

proceed with cardioversion.  The patient received morphine and 

Ativan and had a synchronized cardioversion once at 52 volts with 

immediate change to sinus tachycardia in the 1 teens.  The patient 

stated that his chest tightness resolved immediately following 

cardioversion.  The patient received aspirin, beta-blockers, oxygen 

and heparin while in the emergency department.  He is on amiodarone 

drip.  Individuals from the Cardiac Service were contacted 

regarding possibly getting the patient to the catheterization lab 

especially in light of his ruling in for a myocardial infarction.  

The plan at this time is for the patient to be admitted to the CCU, 

be observed and then to proceed to cardiac catheterization 

thereafter.

CONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  Cardiac Service.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:

1.  Myocardial infarction.

2.  Ventricular tachycardia.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 

admitted in satisfactory condition.  Critical care time is 70 

minutes.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Dennis Holcomb is a lovely 57-year-old gentleman with a past medical history notable for coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction with known ventricular tachycardia with AICD in place.  He continues to work at Alaska Air and has multiple family obligations which are stressful to him.  He has had no exertional neck, chest, arm, or jaw pain.  He has not felt his AICD fire.  He has had no lightheadedness or weakness.  He continues on atenolol, aspirin, folate, furosemide, insulin, lisinopril, simvastatin and Viagra.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam today, his weight is 224, heart rate is 74 and blood pressure is 120/77.  There is no increase in jugular venous pressure.  Carotids are without bruits.  Lungs are clear to auscultation throughout.  Cardiovascular exam is notable for nondisplaced PMI, S1, physiologically split S2 with systolic ejection murmur and a soft holosystolic apical murmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, free of organomegaly and bruits.  Extremities are warm and free of edema with symmetric pulses, motor strength, and sensation.



LABORATORY DATA:  EKG is notable for sinus with evidence of prior inferior myocardial infarction.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  In summary, Dennis has been doing well with respect to his blood pressure control and exercise.  Given his current levels of stress, we are going to change his atenolol to 100 mg in the morning and 50 mg at night, and I have encouraged him to get to a target weight of 190 this year, and I am making no other changes in his medical regimen.

HOLCOMB, DENNIS

83312060

02/26/2128



DATE OF BIRTH:  12/14/67



CHIEF COMPLAINT:  He presents today for his annual history and physical after an absence to this office for the past 2 years.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, currently on insulin for the past 33 years, history of left foot infection, erectile dysfunction, onychomycosis of toenails, hyperlipidemia, CAD, inferior myocardial infarction complicated by ventricular tachycardia, obesity, diabetic retinopathy, ischemic cardiomyopathy and low testosterone.



PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Include cardiac catheterization, coronary stenting and implantable cardiac defibrillator.



DRUG ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.



MEDICATIONS:  Include atenolol 100 mg in the morning and 50 mg in the evening, aspirin 81 mg 2 tablets daily, folic acid 1 mg daily, furosemide 40 mg daily, NPH 40-42 units once daily, regular insulin for sliding scale, lisinopril 5 mg daily, multivitamin once daily, simvastatin 20 mg at bedtime, B12 250 mcg by mouth daily, vitamin C 1000 units daily, and over-the-counter cholesterol-lowering medication.



FAMILY HISTORY:  Father and brother died of cerebral aneurysms, both were hypertensive and smokers, there is also history of cardiac disease in his grandparents.



SOCIAL HISTORY:  Single, works for the Alaska Air Group in Juneau, drinks 1-2 beers a year.  He is a nonsmoker, does not use IV drugs, he is responsible to take care of several sick individuals that are very close to his life, therefore he claims he cannot attention to his own personal health because of caring for others.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient presents today for annual physical.  The patient states he has become enlightened recently that when he goes to Tim Horton's, they pretreated his coffee with sugar as a role and he thinks that is the reason for his diabetic, lack of control over the years.  He has been eliminating concentrated sweets in his diet.  After a while, his blood sugars have gotten much better by his report.  He recently had an eye examination showing stable background retinopathy without any recent changes.  He has had no active podiatry issues over the past 2 months has had no recent chest pain, shortness of breath or PND.  He sees Dr. Isaac Ulibarri for a cardiomyopathy standpoint.  With his AICD everything seems to be working fine according to him when they interrogate his device.  He reports no fever, shakes, chills, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.  Again, he has had no recent chest pain, PND, or orthopnea.  He has had no dysphagia, odynophagia, melena, hematemesis, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria or polyuria.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 126/70 in the right arm, temperature 95.6, pulse 78, respirations are 16, O2 sat 97% on room air.  He is 67 inches tall, 222 pounds.  BMI 34.8.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic, pupils are equally round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements were intact.  He has had minimal wax buildup bilaterally.  TMs were intact.  Oropharynx was clear without erythema or exudate.  Sinuses were nontender.  Nostrils were patent.  Neck is supple Supple without JVD, lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes, rubs or rhonchi.  Heart regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops were appreciated.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  He has a small umbilical hernia that is not protruding and bowel sounds are active.  He has no organomegaly and there is no CVA tenderness.  Extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  He does have significant thickening and brittleness of the toenails of both feet consistent with onychomycosis.  He has no open sores of the feet.  Neurologically, he is alert and oriented x3 and grossly nonfocal with intact distal sensation to light touch in both feet.  He has no generalized lymphadenopathy and his joint examination shows no effusions or erythema.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

1.  Annual physical, preventative maintenance.  The patient had a colonoscopy in 2125 and was told to come back in 2130 because of benign polyps.  I did recommend guaiac stool cards today for home testing purposes.  Immunizations are up-to-date.  He did receive an H1N1 and a seasonal flu vaccine through his employer and for private pharmacies.  His Pneumovax is due to be a booster in 2 years' time.  We are recommending a PSA and a DRE annually starting today.  Labs were also drawn in the office for CBC, CMP, and lipid profile.  The patient is declining Zostavax at this time.  We will recommend a followup in 1 year for an annual physical.

2.  Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.  The patient has now eliminated concentrated sweets from his diet, although I do suspect dietary noncompliance beyond table sugar.  Recommend checking a hemoglobin A1c today, urine for microalbumin, lipid panel and creatinine as well as a BUN and a GFR.  I would recommend continuing his insulin NPH 42 units daily, but we may need to recommend an endocrine consult if his A1c remains elevated despite dietary improvement.  We did recommend aggressive weight loss and exercise as this is a major impediment to his glucose control.  I would recommend follow up in 3 to 4 months.

3.  Obesity.  We will check a TSH, lipid panel and glucose to ensure that he is in good metabolic balance.  I do suspect continued poorly controlled diabetes given his past history.

4.  CAD with history of DVT.  He has had an ICD interrogated recently.  We will check a lipid panel today.  We would like to strive for an LDL less than 70 given his high risk status, I would recommend changing his steroid to a higher dose if required at that point.

History of Present Illness: The patient presents today for follow up of his diabetes and heart disease, and to follow up as well as recent proximal humeral fracture that will not require surgery per his orthopedic specialist. The patient fell down a couple weeks ago on ice and landed on his left shoulder, sustaining a proximal humeral fracture that is currently well aligned. The patient was seen by orthopedics at the Boulder County Hospital, he was told to have no work for the next 3 months. He also received reports no chest pain, PND or orthopnea, he also denies any AICD firing, and reports only occasional low blood sugar reactions. He has a history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, he currently uses NPH insulin 42 units daily with sliding scale to 3 times a day at a maximal 8 units at a time. He reports no polyuria or polydipsia. His only risk doctor for fracture includes a low testosterone diagnosed about 3 years ago. He is currently on no replacement for testosterone, and only recently started calcium and vitamin D after his fracture. He has not had an eye examination in over a year.

2. Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes-will recommend hemoglobin A1c, lipid profile, and urine for microalbumin as well as a TSH, and considered poor the patient from NPH to Lantus or possible to 70/30 insulin, with the patient might ask her benefit with formal endocrine consultation given his poor glycemic control and history of cardiac disease.
3. CAD-will check his lipid panel tonight, aiming for an LDL of below 100

CC  Chest pain



HPI

78 yo F with PMHx sig for CHF, HTN, atrial fibrillation (cardioverted 2/68, now on amiodarone), and DM p/w increased SOB and chest pain over 1 weeks time.  Symptoms not related to exertion and reports sternal area is the location of pain.  Occurs at rest. Feels like pressure and at times sharp pain, not related to respiration. 7/10 when maximal intensity.  Pain is constant in nature, patient states lasting up to hours at a time.  No specific provocative or palliative factors.  Not related to position.  Reports that SOB and chest pain are chronic problems for her and the reason she presented to the ED is because the symptoms have increased over the past week.



No associated symptoms of N/V or diaphoresis.  Reports occasional palpitations.  Patient also feels pain in her back, shoulders, and arms which she attributes to her arthritis and not radiation of the pain.  States that she sleeps on 4 pillows and this does represent on acute change.



Denies fever/chills.  Reports constipation at baseline (BMs do not occur everyday). Patient states she has    frequent sinus infections.   



PMHx

HTN, CHF (good systolic function though), Afib (past cardioversion Feb. 2068),

DM

Pulmonary embolism - bilateral, treated at Buzan County Clinic (CT with multiple filling defects in LLL, RUL, RLL c/w PE), non-Q wave MI with inferolateral apical depressoins at Buzan County Clinic 6/69; RSH admission 5/17/70 with D-dimer=1976, CT negative for PE and DVT

Osteoarthritis, anxiety, depression with psychotic features, lumbar disc disease (s/p surgical repairs), 

Echo: 5/21/70: The left ventricular systolic function within normal limits.  There is segmental left ventricular dysfunction which involves the inferior territory, this has deceased sine 12/68 study. The estimated ejection fraction is 57%. Estimated RV systolic pressure is 89 mmHg. Right ventricular systolic function is within normal limits.



Stress The ECG response to pharmacological stress was  uninterpretable for ischemia. The myocardial scans are within normal limits and do not demonstrate evidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction. Region(s) with apparent reduction in tracer activity likely reflect soft tissue attenuation, not specific for coronary artery disease. LVEF=64%.





PE protocol CT 5/70: no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Delayed venogram of the pelvis and lower extremities demonstrates no evidence of of DVT.

A 2.2 x 1.4 cm nodule is identified on image 112 in the right upper lobe.  In addition, there is ground glass opacity involving the bilateral lungs.  There is interstitial pulmonary edema and a small right pleural effusion.

5/23 Chest CT: previously demonstrated nodule in the right upper lung measuring 17 mm x 11 mm has resolved.

Assessment and Plan



78F h/o CHF (diastolic dysfunction), Afib (s/p cardioversion), HTN, DM, past b/l PE presents with increased CP and SOB times week. Differential includes CHF exacerbation (? Setting of med noncompliance), ACS, PE.



1)PE - D-dimer is 2257; Heparin 6000 unit bolus, 1000 unit/hr with sliding scale; PE protocol CT;

Continue to hold Metformin, received 600mg Mucomyst in preparation for dye load and continue 2 doses post scan; Preliminary CT read: no evidence of PE although limited by motion artifact; ground glass changes c/w with CHF; Continue Heparin as pt. with h/o PE and awaiting final CT read.



2) r/o MI - Enzymes negative x2; ASA, O2; B-blocker continued (no evidence of systolic dysfunction); Received ACE (Zestril x1), now hold in setting of dye load



3) CHF - strict I&Os, daily weight, no salt diet; exam reveals slight fluid overload, after initial diuresis (Lasix 20 IV x2) will hold in light of CT w contrast, monitor fluid status, no IVF at this time



4) DM - hold Metformin, on Insulin SS with bid coverage



5) Urine - negative nitrite/WBC, sediment 5-10 WBCs, few bacteria; Likely asymptomatic bacteruria in elderly patient, afebrile, no increased WBC, therefore no treatment at this time.

Esposito, Perla
#146-55-23-5                                 November 11, 2076
 
Has had no exertional chest pains.  Urinates two to three times a
night but not very frequently during the day.  Ran out of her
Lopressor yesterday.  Continues to have some discomfort in her
right buttock radiating down the side of her leg.  Not happy with
the orthotics that were given her for her arch pain because she can
only use them with bulkier shoes.  Has had some right shoulder
discomfort.  
 
Meds:  Procardia XL 120 mg. q.d.  Aspirin 325 mg. q.d.  Lopressor
100 mg. b.i.d.  Micronase 5 mg. q.d.  
 
W. 141.  176/90 in the left arm, 178/90 in the right.  80.  Good
range of motion of the right shoulder.  There is some crepitance
over the AC joint.  No subdeltoid or bicipital tendon tenderness. 
Full range of motion.  Lungs are clear.  Soft, positive S4.  No
pedal edema.
 
1.  CAD.  Doing well without angina.
 
2.  Hypertension.  I renewed her Lopressor. Will recheck this after
she has been taking both medications faithfully.
 
3.  Diabetes.  Will check a glucose today and I renewed her
Micronase.
 
4.  Question right sciatica.  She is not interested in any invasive
therapy so we will not pursue imaging at this time.  She had a
negative CT in 2073.  I put her on 400 mg. of Motrin three times a
day.
 
5.  Arch pain.  This is clearly not that bothersome that she feels
that it is more important to wear lighter shoes.  
 
6.  Right shoulder pain. She may have some mild rotator cuff
tendinitis. We discussed the importance of not overusing this
shoulder and avoiding lifting anything heavier than a coffee cup. 
Motrin 400 mg. t.i.d. on a full stomach.  I showed her some range
of motion exercises.

Follow-up visit for this 77-year-old Chilean woman. 
 
She comes today bothered by right-sided shoulder pain. On a
previous visit she had complained of this and I wanted to put her
on Motrin but she wanted to try Tylenol. The pain bothers her
sometimes at night and is throbbing. It bothers her when she
tries to attach her bra behind her back. Other than that she has
been doing fairly well. She has not had any chest pains. She has
not had any symptoms of TIAs. She has a lot of concern about her
chronic renal insufficiency and wants to discuss this. 
 
Medications: Lopressor. Hydochlorothiazide. Procardia XL.
Micronase. Motrin. Aspirin.
 
Allergies: Lisinopril causes hypokelemia.
 
Family History: Non-contributory. 
 
Social History: She has a daughter, Rhodes, who has been very
supportive. No cigarettes or alcohol. 
 
Review of Systems: She refuses general GYN screening. She had a
hemoglobin A1C in March, which was 6.4. She had an ophthalmology
exam in September. 
 
Physical Examination: Worried. Weight 131 lb. Blood pressure
142/60. Pulse is 72. Skin exam unremarkable. HEENT: EOMI. No
scleral icterus. No lymphadenopathy. No thyromegaly. I cannot
hear any carotid bruits. Lungs are clear. No murmurs. No gallops.
Benign abdomen. No hepatomegaly. No splenomegaly. No pedal edema.
Examination of the right shoulder shows that she has tenderness
on abduction beyond 110 but her most marked tenderness is with
her internal rotation and she is unable to do this further than
L5.
 
Procedure: The right subdeltoid bursa was prepped with Betadine.
The skin was infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine in a 27 gauge needle.
The subdeltoid bursa itself was entered with a 21 gauge needle
and a mixture of 1cc of 1% Xylocaine and 40mg of Depo-Medrol was
injected. She tolerated the procedure well.

AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT 
There is no evidence of valvular aortic stenosis. The aortic valve is tricuspid. There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or spectral Doppler. 
LEFT VENTRICLE 
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. The left ventricular systolic function is within normal limits. There are no obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities. There is a false tendon within the LV cavity which is a normal variant. The estimated ejection fraction is 65 %. 
TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC 
There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of mild tricuspid insufficiency. 
PULMONARY VALVE, INFUND., P.A. 
There is evidence of trace pulmonary insufficiency by color and spectral Doppler. The RV systolic pressure was estimated from the regurgitant tricuspid velocity (assuming an RA pressure of 10mmHg). The estimated RV systolic pressure is 33 mmHg. 
RIGHT VENTRICLE 
The right ventricle is not dilated. The right ventricular systolic function is within normal limits. 
INTERATRIAL SEPTUM, INTERVENTRICULAR SEPTUM 
There are increased echoes along the interatrial septum c/w a closure device. The appearance of the device is most c/w an Amplatzer device. There is evidence of a patent foramen ovale by agitated saline contrast after Valsalva maneuver. 
PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES 
There is no evidence of pericardial effusion. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Compared to the report of 12/06/2063, there is residual shunt with the valsalva manuever. 




	Assessment and plan:
   In summary, Xian is a 56-year-old female s/p myocardial infarction, likely the result of paradoxical emboli via a large PFO, and s/p closure of her PFO on 12/05/63 using a 25 mm Crybiform Amplatzer device.  She is doing well from the cardiac perspective, and denies any further neurological events.  Upon our review of the echocardiogram there is a trace shunt across the device (7 beats, only after Valsalva) consistent w/ intra-pulmonary shunting.  We are willing to try decreasing her Toprol XL to 12.5mg qd, in an attempt to alleviate her HA's.  If this proves unsucessful, we will trial a course of Atenolol.  We agree with continuation of her ASA therapy and will see her in f/u for her 6 month appointment in June w/ an Echo w/ bubbles.

RE:  S/p PFO closure using a 25 mm Cribiform Amplatzer device on 12/05/63

Dear Dr. Yancy: 

  It is a pleasure seeing Mrs. Xuereb in follow up s/p her PFO closure on 12/05/63 using a 25 mm Cribriform Amplatzer device. 
Her history is also significant for inferior STEMI the morning after arthroscopic shoulder surgery for adhesive capsulitis in 10/63, Protein S deficiency, COPD, HTN and dyslipidemia. 
She is doing well from the cardiac perspective. She continues to note a rare, short-lived palpitation but states that these have definitely lessened in nature over the years. She does report, however, that she began to note non-exertional, short-lived episodes of chest pain which started about 1 month ago. She says that by the time she ""thinks about taking a SL NTG"", the pain has resolved. Her catheterization revealed non-significant CAD. Significant spasm in the ostium of the RCA. The distal RCA at the prior intervention site looks normal. 
She denies any further neurological events or headaches. 
Of note, she reveals that a few weeks prior to onset of chest pain she began smoking again. She was smoking 5 cigs/day, and has stopped since Saturday when she resumed her Chantix treatment plan. 
Our last recorded lipid profile drawn on 5/2/2064: CHOL: 135, HDL: 50. No TG or LDL noted. She has had this repeated since and is being followed by Dr. Yelton. We concur with LDL goal of &amp;lt;100.


	Past medical history:
   CAD-s/p IMI following shoulder surgery with evidence of acute thrombotic occlusion of her RCA; no other atherosclerotic lesions identified. ? paradoxical emboli. s/p thrombectomy with Export catheter - 10/04/2063

	Assessment and plan:
   In summary, Xian is a 59-year-old female s/p myocardial infarction, likely the result of paradoxical emboli via a large PFO, and s/p closure of her PFO on 12/05/63 using a 25 mm Cribriform Amplatzer device. She remains stable from the cardiac perspective, and denies any further neurological events. Given her new onset of chest pain, and recent return to smoking, we have asked her to stop smoking and call us in 2 weeks to report any change in her chest pain. If at that time, the pain has persisted we will obtain an ETT without imaging; if her pain has resolved with smoking cessation we will ask her to follow up with her PCP to continue with smoking cessation plan. We have asked that she have Dr. Paulette Yancy fax us a copy of her most recent lipid profile for our records and have reiterated the LDL goal of less than 100 for secondary prevention of strokes. We have asked her to obtain a TTE without bubbles for our annual review, and will call her once these results are available to us. We agree with continuation of her ASA therapy and will see her in follow up appointment in 1 year with another TTE without bubbles.

Ms. Bird comes in today to follow up on her weight and blood sugar 
control, as well as to discuss her overall mental status and its effects 
on her living situation.
 
PMH:  Her past medical history includes atrial fibrillation, status post 
renal allograft, status post aortic and mitral valve replacements with a 
mechanical valve, on chronic Coumadin, a recent aortic aneurysm repair 
and complications around that, including a cellulitis which has been 
treated, and now waxing and waning mental status.  She also is 
insulin-dependent diabetic.  
 
MEDICATIONS:  Her medications currently include:
1.   Neurontin 300 t.i.d.
2.   Insulin NPH 20 units in the morning, 10 in the evening.
3.   Fosamax each day.
4.   Premarin and Provera.
5.   Tums Extra-Strength.
6.   digoxin 0.25 and 0125.
7.   Mevacor 40 a day.
8.   Coumadin 1mg each day, except Sunday 2mg.
9.   Imuran 100mg a day.
10.  prednisone 20mg every other day.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient notes that she has been feeling well and 
more active.  She is able to walk around her house without her walker.  
She does use the walker outside of the house for safety and precaution.  
She is independent in bathing and washing, as well as cooking and 
preparing meals.  She, however, is requiring a lot of assistance with 
managing her medications.  She has her daughter-in-law downstairs help 
her with this.  She has not been out of the house much in the last 
several months, and, while she wants to drive, no-one has allowed her to 
get behind the wheel.  
 
The patient otherwise feels well with no chest pain, no shortness of 
breath, no change in her bowel or bladder.
 
HABITS:  She has had a weight which has been stable, and her appetite 
has been good.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Notable for a well-appearing female who walks 
with a walker, slowly, but in no acute distress.  Her weight is 104 lbs.  
Her blood pressure today is 130/72.  Her pulse is 80 and regular today.  
She has no peripheral edema, and she is comfortable sitting in a chair.
 
IMPRESSION:  My overall impression is that Ms. Bird is stable with 
her current regimen and medications.  We have been manipulating her

Coumadin to keep her INR between 2 and 3.5 and, most recently, it was 
2.5, earlier this week.  She will continue on her current medications, 
as noted above.  
 
The bulk of the discussion was regarding her home situation and her 
mental status.  She has clearly improved her mental status gradually 
over the last several months.  She is anxious to drive.  However, 
everyone in the family who is with her at the visit and her visiting 
nurse agree that she is not mentally sound enough to be behind a wheel.  
I explained this in no uncertain terms, and also set a milestone in 
management of her own medications.  Hence, our three goals that we set 
today were:
1.   Management of the patient's own medications, which she was doing 
     six months ago.
2.   To get out of the house at least once a week, using either 
     community transportation or a family member.
3.   To be doing the family's laundry each week.
 
While the patient was not happy about being told that she could not 
drive, she understood the reasons and was satisfied with the goals that 
we set.
 
Hence, I will see her back in about six weeks and see how she is doing 
with these goals.  As well, we will continue to have the visiting nurse 
see her every other week to monitor her blood sugar and Coumadin.

ID: Mrs. Bird comes in today for a routine check-up.  She is a 
70-year-old female with multiple medical problems including atrial 
fibrillation, status post renal allograft, status post MVR and AVR, on 
Coumadin now, history of CABG in the setting of her valve replacements, 
history of a recent aortic aneurysm repair with some mental status 
diminution after the surgery. 
 
MEDICATIONS: Synthroid, Hydralazine, Lopressor, prednisone, Coumadin, 
Provera, NPH insulin, Neurontin 300mg t.i.d., Imuran 100mg a day, Zocor 
20mg a day, and Digoxin 0.25 alternating with 0.125mg.  She is also 
taking Fosamax 10mg a day and Premarin 0.3mg a day.  
 
The patient is followed closely by a visiting nurse at home.  Her blood 
pressure checks have all been 120-140/70-90 and her blood sugars have 
been running in the morning between 80 and 120 and in the evening from 
150 all the way up to 450.  We have made some adjustments recently in 
her NPH morning dose, and hope to see if this will make a benefit.  
 
Patient notes that she has been feeling generally well, that she has 
been able to fill her cassettes for her medicines, and overall manage her 
medicines without problems.  She does note that she is having some pain 
down her left leg, which she describes as her usual sciatica.  The 
patient has had this on multiple occasions, and it usually waxes and 
wanes over time.  The Neurontin in the past has been very helpful for 
this. 
 
The patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, has had no 
fevers or weight loss recently, and has no dyspnea at nighttime. 
 
PHYSICAL EXAM: Notable for a short female in no acute distress, who 
walks with a walker today.  Blood pressure: 144/76.  Pulse: 78 and 
regular.  Her lungs bilaterally are clear to auscultation.   Her heart 
is with sharp click during S1 and S2.  She has got a regular rate and 
rhythm today.  Her abdomen is soft, nontender, with no organomegaly.  
She has got a well-healed abdominal scar. She has got no lower extremity 
edema.  Her musculoskeletal examination is notable for tenderness up 
into the sciatic notch on the left side.  She has got otherwise joints 
that move through a normal range of motion, no swelling or warmth. There 
is no evidence for ecchymoses or petechiae anywhere.  
 
Today will check a hemoglobin A1C, a CBC, and a chem 7 for routine 
monitoring. 
 
My overall impression is that Ms. Bird is doing quite well.   I will 
not make any changes to her medicines until I see her hemoglobin A1C.  I 
suggested that I could give her an injection for her sciatica, but I 
would rather wait because of her anticoagulation, and to see whether it 
remits on it's own.

Lastly, as far as her ability to drive, this has been an issue for the 
last several months since her abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. She is 
clearly doing better from a mental status standpoint, as evidenced by 
her being able to manage her own medications.  I have discussed this 
issue at length with family and her nurse, and everybody is comfortable 
with her trying to drive with someone in the car with her.  I will talk 
to her son, Steven Bird, who lives downstairs, and see whether he or 
his wife could help with trying her out driving first in a schoolyard 
without any people there, and then on less-crowded roads, and then 
finally in a more regular situation.  We will try this over time and see 
how it works, and I will be involved in making any decisions as far as 
letting her drive on her own.

RE:  Bird, Terri                                                    
MRN: 80910690                                                           
  
Dear Dr. Irvine:
 
I had the chance today to see Terri Bird in follow-up, as her 
primary care physician. As you are well aware, she is 71-year-old female 
who resides currently at the Elm Hills Nursing Home where you 
have been taking care of her. I have not seen her now for the past ten 
months. For my records, I am going to summarize her medical history 
briefly. It includes a history of atrial fibrillation. She is status 
post an MVR with Duluth Clinic. She is on chronic anti-coagulation. She is 
status post a renal allograft for what is believed to be a history of 
strep glomerular nephritis. She has been on Imuran and Prednisone for 
several decades with no history of rejection. She also has a history of 
a CABG in the setting of her valve replacement. As well, she has a 
history of spinal stenosis, for which she has been treated 
intermittently with epidural steroid injection. About a year ago, she 
had an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and in this setting developed 
some delirium and at that point was sent to rehab where she had a ankle 
fracture and a long recovery and she spent time at several different 
nursing homes and had a hip fracture as well as a recurrent ankle 
fracture and most recently has been with you at Elm Hills Nursing Home. I also have a discharge summary from a recent hospitalization 
where she had a pneumonia, a right middle lobe which was successfully 
treated with levofloxacin. 
 
MEDICATIONS: Her current medications from the notes that I received 
include Premarin .3mg, Neurontin 300mg each day, Miacalcin nasal spray, 
Provera 2.5mg, Synthroid 25mcg, Digoxin 125mcg, Cardizem CD 180mg a day, 
Imuran 100mg a day, Lopressor 50mg twice a day, calcium carbonate 500mg 
three times a day, Isordil 3 times a day as well as Coumadin based on 
her INR.
 
ALLERGIES: She has an allergy to penicillin as well as sulfur and 
cephalosporins and of note she had been on a tapering Prednisone dose 
which seems to have been stopped. As well, she is on sliding scale 
insulin and Humulin N, which seems to have been adjusted recently. 
RE:  Bird, Terri                                                    
MRN: 80910690

The patient was brought to me today by her family, because they were 
concerned that she was not getting optimal care. In talking to her, she 
says she feels quite well. She has no pain. She has no pain in her 
buttocks or her legs. She says her breathing feels well. She has no 
productive cough. She has no chest pain. She denies any peripheral 
edema. She notes that she is concerned that she is not getting enough 
exercise at Elm Hill Nursing Home, but otherwise feels like she 
is getting reasonable care. However, she does breakdown and cry about 
her current situation in that she is depressed about living in a nursing 
home. 
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On the exam today, her blood pressure is 122/70. 
She has a regular rate and rhythm on heart exam with a pulse of 72. She 
has sharp clicks over her chest. She has a soft abdomen with no 
organomegaly and a well healed scar. She has equal pulses bilaterally. 
She has got a normal skin exam with multiple skin tags. She has a full 
range of motion in her upper extremities as well as her hips, knees and 
ankles. She has a stooped gate and I watch her walk with her walker and 
she seems relatively stable. She is somewhat confused about the date and 
the place, but recognizes me and is able to articulate very clearly 
about her current situation at Elm Hills. 
 
I have no laboratory data to speak of. 
 
I had a long conversation with her and her husband as well as her son 
and daughter-in-law and explained my concerns with her overall safety 
and I thought that currently it would be unwise for her to be in an 
unsupervised setting. I thought that a nursing home is a reasonable 
place for her to be and suggested quite strongly to consider an 
antidepressant. It looks like you have had a psychiatrist evaluate her 
recently and I think it would be worthwhile, at least a month trial of 
SSRI, gradually titrating up the dose based on her side effects. 
 
I am more than happy to see her intermittently to give her reassurance, 
but it seems like your care has been excellent and feel free to contact 
me with questions about her past history. 
 
Sincerely,

MD Connect Call 11:59pm 2/16/69 from Dr. Hale at Senior Care Clinic Queen Creek, SD regarding Terri Bird.  Patient admitted there 2/12/69 with CHF exacerbation with some associated COPD exacerbation and associated pneumonia.  All initially improved but then clinically worsening 2/14-2/16.  Patient requiring 100% NRB mask to maintain normal saturation with rising BUN/CR (hx kidney transplant).  Clinically showing pulmonary edema but no urine output to IV lasix.  Patient had established DNR status.  



Request by family to Dr. Hale to transfer patient to GCM.  I spoke to MD, nurse, and daughter-in-law and offered to accept patient when she was medically stabilized.  I thought she was too ill to safely transfer at the time without intubation before-hand.  



I called RN back at 6am and learned that patient had O2 saturation of 70%, pH=7.2 and covering MD had honored patient's established DNR order despite some family members desire to reverse it.  Patient too ill to transfer safely; will contact me again if patient stabilized.

SABINE MEDICAL CENTER



Reason for visit:

   Follow up: NSVT and history of VF Arrest



Interval History:

   Mr. Quijano returned for follow-up today. His last visit was in December 2075, following which he had a routine stress test. He had been planning to do some skiing over January, and we wanted to give him clearance to do so.



His stress test was done on 1-4-76, and revealed mild apical ischemia. He completed 8 METs and had no symptoms during the test.  Based on these findings, we did not change any medications and encouraged him to continue with his usual activities.  Unfortunatley, he was never able to ski over January anyway due to a bout with pneumonia.



He had also reported a vague sensation of shortness of breath that was occurring ""rarely"", but was correlated with the consumption of alcohol.  The frequency of these episodes has increased to 2-3 times per week. He says it is not really shortness of breath, but an awareness that something feels different. He is able to continue his usual activities, including his aerobics and pilates classes without difficulty.



He denies any chest discomfort, palpitations, rapid heart action, dizziness or syncope.



Past medical history:

   DMII, CAD, s/p CABG, VF Arrest Hypercholesterolemia, 1st Degree AV block, RBBB, NSVT



Medications (Confirmed):



			

Dalmane 30 mg

glyburide 2.5mg po qd

Lipitor 20 mg

lisinopril 5 mg po qd

metformin hydrochloride 500 mg

Nexium 40mg po qd



Physical examination:

-BP: 110/70  

-Pulse: 50  

-General:   No acute distress.

-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.

-Heent:   Unremarkable

-Neck:   Carotids 2+ without bruits. JVP no jugular venous distention.

-Chest:   Clear to auscultation.

-Cardiac:   Left ventricular impulse discrete and nondisplaced. Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, with no S3 or S4. There were no murmurs, clicks or rubs.

-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds, soft and nontender, with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.

-Extremities:   No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. 2+ pedal pulses.



EKG:

   Sinus Bradycardia 50bpm, 1st degree AV block PR 290ms, RBBB. Compared to previous EKGs, PR interval is slightly longer.



Assessment and plan:

   Mr. Quijanno is doing well with the exception of these brief episodes of shortness of breath. I am encouraged that these events do not inhibit him from exercise. We have fitted him with a holter monitor today to further sort out any arrhythmogenic etiology of his symptoms.  We will discuss the findings over the phone on Wednesday of this week.



The above plan was discussed with Dr. Kilian Middleton, who is in agreement.

Re:  	Quijano, Donny 

	SMC Unit # 544-84-52



Dear Dr. Galvan:



I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Quijano, in followup for episodes of dyspnea, in the setting of asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, myasthenia gravis and distant coronary disease.



He reports that his    spasms    of unpredictable exertional breathlessness have continued to be substantially in remission, occurring less than once a week and sometimes only every two weeks.  Swallowing is fine with fewer choking episodes when he drinks water, but no problem with the ingestion of other substances.  



No cough, phlegm, lower extremity edema, chest pain or chest infections.



No reflux symptoms.



Sneezing spells and coryza, especially in the morning, have been most noticeable in the past several months.



He enjoyed his trip to Romania, and had only two days when he had a couple of minor spells.



Medications:  Advair, 100/50, one puff b.i.d. (continues the 10 second breath hold); lisinopril; atenolol; Mestinon; Metformin; no proton pump inhibitor.



On examination, he is his usual fit-appearing self.  Blood pressure is 130/70, respiratory rate 18 and unlabored, heart rate 55 and regular.  Conjunctivae are clear.  Sinuses nontender.  Nasal passages are narrowed but without inflammation.  Oropharynx:  Mild crowding in the posterior pharynx, but there were no definite exudates.  No goiter or adenopathy.  Back:  Normal configuration.  Chest:  Normal percussion note, faint prolongation of the expiratory phase without definite wheezes.  Cardiac:  Vague cardiac impulse, 1/6 systolic mid to late systolic murmur at the apex, JVP 8 cm with borderline HJR, no S3.  Abdomen:  Soft, scaphoid, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass.  Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Skin:  Well tanned.



Pulmonary function tests today show regression of the FEV1 from 2.09 liters on 6/27 to 1.72 liters, similar to the 1.62 liter value of 6/13, with an FVC that has decreased from 3.47 on 6/27 to 2.8 liters now, although with an FET of only 8.5 versus 14.3.



CT scan today, by my review - A tiny nodule in the extreme right apex, mildly thickened bronchi in the extreme left lower lobe, status post mediasternotomy with diffuse calcification of the coronary arteries.



Impression:



Episodic dyspnea due to asthma, with underlying excellent functional status and because of his stoicism and fitness, with the variability in pulmonary function on testing correlating well with a slight increase in the frequency of his occasional episodes, because of the asthma and allergies, he may benefit from Singulair.



Probable mild occult gastroesophageal reflux.



Ischemic coronary disease, status post VF arrest and revascularization.



Myasthenia, mainly ocular.



Prior Raynaud's syndrome.



Recommendations:



Continue Advair at the current dose.



Trial of Singulair, 10 mg p.o. q. p.m.



Low threshold for adding a proton-pump inhibitor and/or intranasal steroids.



Continue exercise program.



Return visit in three months with pulmonary function tests at that time.



It has been a pleasure to participate in his care.



Sincerely yours,







Dean S. Nye, M.D.

Reason for visit

			

  Followup of numerous active issues.



Major Problems





Diabetes mellitus

Metformin 1000 mg BID.  Added low-dose glyburide 1.25 mg QD in October, for hemoglobin A1c 7.80.  Followup hemoglobin A1c last month better, 7.10.  Asked him to concentrate more on diet.  Says he is up-to-date with Ophthalmology.



Hyperlipidemia

Lipitor 10 mg QD.  Tolerating well.  Check followup lipids, CK, and transaminases.  Target LDL 70.



Coronary artery disease

Followed by Dr.  Middleton.  Suffered a cardiac arrest while skiing January 2072.  Resuscitated, cardioverted, sent to Lowell General Hospital, transferred to SMC.  Cath showed 70% distal left main; 90% proximal LAD; 90% first diagonal; 60% left circumflex; 40% first marginal; RCA normal.  Underwent three-vessel bypass grafting (SVG to LAD, diagonal, OM).  Has done well since then.  Most recent ETT January 2076 showed an equivocal mild apical reversible defect, but nothing else.  Asymptomatic.     02/23/2077:   Remains asymptomatic.  Continue medical management which at this point consists of antiplatelet therapy, beta blocker, and ACE inhibitor.



Asthma

Severe in childhood.  Now mild/intermittent, occasional/episodic shortness of breath.  Probably aggravated by GERD.  Followed by Dr.  Nye of Pulmonary; sees his notes.  Doing well with inhalers, Singulair.  Lungs clear today.     02/23/2077:   Recently treated with Levaquin for questionable left lower lobe infiltrate.  Followup chest film negative.  Symptoms have resolved.  Lungs are clear on exam.  Continue followup with pulmonary.  Takes Advair 500/50, albuterol PRN, and Singulair 10 mg QD.



Gastroesophageal reflux disease

Documented on barium swallow 2069.  PPI therapy has been recommended, but  has not been very compliant.  Given another prescription today.     02/23/2077:   Complains that omeprazole gives him diarrhea.  Change to Protonix 40 mg QD.



Myasthenia gravis

Initially presented with ptosis and diplopia, no other symptoms.  CT negative for thymoma.  Initially treated with prednisone, now on mestinon, doing well without symptoms. Followed by Dr.  Tyson.     02/23/2077:   No new or unusual symptoms.

Major Problems





Coronary artery disease

Cardiac arrest while skiing January 2072; cath showed 70% distal left main, 90% proximal LAD, 90% first diagonal, 60% left circumflex, 40% first marginal, RCA normal.  Underwent 3-vessel bypass (SVGs to the LAD, diagonal, OM).  Last ETG January 2076 showed an equivocal mild apical reversible defect.  Remains asymptomatic.  Cardiovascular exam stable.  Update ECG.  He continues to see Dr.  Middleton periodically.



Diabetes mellitus

Metformin 1000 mg BID.  Added low-dose glyburide 1.25 mg QD in October, for hemoglobin A1c 7.80.  Followup hemoglobin A1c last month better, 7.10.  Asked him to concentrate more on diet.  Says he is up-to-date with Ophthalmology.     05/25/2077:   He remains asymptomatic.  Check A1c and urine albumin/creatinine ratio today.



Hyperlipidemia

Lipitor 10 mg QD.  Tolerating well.  Check followup lipids, CK, and transaminases.  Target LDL 70.02/27/2077:  Recent lipid profile excellent with LDL 72, HDL 70, triglycerides 46, and total cholesterol 151.  Serum CPK, June 2076, SGOT 74, and SGPT 41.  Review of prior test results discloses chronic low-grade elevation serum CK. Spoke with the patient; no myalgias, arthralgias, or fevers. Possibly related to Lipitor.  Discontinue, substitute pravastatin.  Return in four weeks to recheck CK and transaminases.  The patient understands.  Call in the meantime for problems or questions.     05/25/2077:   Now on pravastatin without side effects.  CK unchanged.  Continue to follow.



Gastroesophageal reflux disease

Documented on barium swallow 2069.  PPI therapy has been recommended, but  has not been very compliant.  Given another prescription today.02/23/2077:   Complains that omeprazole gives him diarrhea.  Change to Protonix 40 mg QD.     05/25/2077:   Doing well on Protonix without symptoms.

Major Problems





Diabetes mellitus

Metformin 1000 mg BID, glyburide 1.25 mg QD.  He is trying to be much more disciplined with his diet and as a result, according to his wife, he is experiencing fairly frequent minor hypoglycemic episodes.  His last hemoglobin A1c six months ago was 6.50.  Recheck today.  I suspect we will be able to discontinue the glyburide.  Urine albumin/creatinine ratio within normal limits six months ago.



Coronary artery disease

Cardiac arrest January 2072 while skiing; multivessel disease on cath; underwent three-vessel bypass (SVGs to the LAD, diagonal, OM).  Most recent ETT January 2076 showed equivocal mild apical reversible defect.  Remains active, has had no chest discomfort of any kind or palpitations.  Continue medical management.



Myasthenia gravis

Remains on Mestinon.  Denies symptoms.



Hyperlipidemia

Remains on pravastatin.  Total cholesterol 151, HDL 70, LDL 72, triglycerides 46 February 2077.  Complains of occasional leg spasms but has no fevers or GI symptoms.  Check CK and transaminases.



Asthma

He continues to be followed by Dr.  Nye; see his notes.  Continues to have occasional episodes of very minor shortness of breath at rest, never with exercise.  Lungs clear.  Doing well.



Gastroesophageal reflux disease

Documented on barium swallow 2069.  Compliant with PPI.  No symptoms.



Anemia

Longstanding issue, hematocrit in mid 30s, MCV mid 90s, iron studies, ferritin, B12, and folate unremarkable.  Check TSH, SPEP.05/25/2077:   TSH and SPEP unremarkable.  Check EPO level, follow CBC.     11/21/2077:   EPO level inappropriately low.  Therefore, suspect anemia is secondary to age-related reduction in renal mass/GFR.



Hypertension

On low-dose ACE inhibitor and beta blocker.  Blood pressure today uncharacteristically elevated, 150/70.  He attributes this to rushing to get to his appointment with me.  Blood pressure earlier this month was 120/55 at his pulmonary visit.  I suspect that he is probably well controlled overall.  For now, no change in management.

REFERRING PHYSICIAN:
Richard L. Mckenzie, M.D.
San Luis Obispo County General Hospital
123 Pittsburg Street, Euite 598
Baxter Springs, MO  64715

HISTORY:  Mr. Ehlers is referred for evaluation of extensive coronary disease status.  He has history of several risk factors and a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and a history of cigarette smoking. He has a prior history of peripheral arterial disease with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm.  He also has a history of bicuspid aortic valve with mild-to-moderate stenosis on recent echos and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  

He is status post a posterolateral MI in 2084 and had an adenosine MIBI in January 2097 with an old inferior MI and peri-infarct ischemia.  He presented with increasing angina with exertion where he is able to do most activities and climb stairs and walk his dog, but does have about one episode of angina a week while raking leaves that last about 5 minutes and resolves with rest.  He has not had any rest pain.  For his increasing angina, he had an attempted cardiac catheterization done last month, but they are unable to advance the guidewire pass the iliac artery and an MRI was able to determine that he has an occluded aorta.  He then had a left brachial artery.  Cardiac catheterization that revealed extensive coronary disease with a 70-80% distal left main stenosis and severe disease of the LAD and circumflex with minimal flow and a subtotal occlusion of the proximal right coronary with collateralization from the LAD territory.  There was an anomalous circumflex that appeared to emerge from the right coronary and there was a question of his anomalus LAD with a separate ostium superior to the left main, but the documentation of this was not clear.  With the complexity of his anatomy, he is referred for further evaluation.  He has otherwise a history of cigarette smoking and quit three months ago, does not drink alcohol.  He is married and lives in Missouri.

MEDICATIONS:  His baseline medicines include aspirin 81 mg a day, has included warfarin, ramipril 10 mg a day, Lopressor 50 mg twice a day, Lipitor 80 mg a day and Zetia 10 mg a day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A well-appearing man in no acute distress.  Blood pressure of 128/60, pulse of 60-70 and room air sat of 99%.  He had no jugular venous distention.  Chest was clear.  Heart had normal S1 and S2.  No S3 or S4.  There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the left sternal border.  His abdomen was benign.  Extremities showed no peripheral edema, but very faint distal pulses that were audible by Doppler.

IMAGING STUDIES:  His electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with left anterior fascicular block and was otherwise unremarkable.  His labs showed a BUN/creatinine of 21/1.3, glucose 145 and hematocrit of 40%.

IMPRESSION:  Mr. Ehlers presents with extensive vascular disease including left main and three-vessel disease.  We will try and define better his actual anatomy and likely do act angiogram to try and identify the locations of any anomalus vessels and then have a surgical consults regarding bypass surgery for his left main extensive disease.  We will also get an echocardiogram to reevaluate carefully the aortic valve.  We will also likely consult the vascular surgeons to discuss management of the occluded aorta.

LOUISIANA AVENUE MEDICAL CENTER


Patient:  Ehlers, Ulysses	MR: 28735364
Renal Attending: Dr. Judge
Admission Date: 4/24/2098			Consultation Date: 4/24/2098

Reason for Consultation: 
Progressive renal impairment.
Creat rose from 1.6 (Nov 97) to 4.07 (may 98)

History of Present Illness:
This is a 69 year old male with a hx of CAD s/p CABG 10/2097, who was referred on 6/03 from renal Dr. Turk, Elvis at the Central Buffalo Hospital to Dr. Judge at BHCC for rapidly progressive renal impairment.  He is an arteriopath with occluded aorta beneath the levels of renal arteries as revealed in recent MRA. In the past an attempted femoral artery cannulation was proved unsuccessful due to above reason. Subsequently he underwent two cardiac angiograms thro' left brachial and Rt radial arterial route.

 His creatinine has risen from baseline of 1.6 (Nov 97, post CABG) to 4.07 (may 98). He denies taking any NSAIDS. He thinks that he was started on Altace post surgery, but was not sure about that fact.

Dr. Turk did an duplex scan to assess his renal arteries which was suggestive of high grade stenosis of renal arteries on both sides. Since IR doctors at CentralBuffalo were not keen to do renal agniogram/angioplasty thro' radial artery route, Dr.Turk refered Mr. Ehlers to BHCC for consideration of renal angioplasty. He has also asked him to discontinue Altace and to withold coumadin (Indn: AF) inview of potential angioplasty.

He complains of claudication pains in both legs with left leg>Rt leg. He experiences pain on exertion on left calf, thigh and buttock. He complains of long term pedal swelling which extends upto upper knee level. He is SOB on moderate exertion and sleeps with 3 pillows. He also has some prostatic symptoms with poor urinary stream, frequency etc.

ASSESSMENT:
Progressive renal dysfunction in the setting of severe bilateral renal artery stenosis for consideration of reno-vascular disease.

PLAN:
1. His MRA of abdomen was reviewed with Dr.Quilici, BHCC IR department. Aorta is fully occluded beneath the level of both kidneys. Tight renal artery stenosis noted in both kidneys. Both proximal and distal stenosis noted in the Rt renal artery. Both kidneys appeared normal in size 11.2 and 11.4 cm. Dr.Quilici is confident that renal angioplasty could be done relatively safely through radial artery approach.

2. We have requested Dr.Xi, Vascular surgeon to get his opinon on the need for surgical revascularisation of feet to save his legs from critical ischemia in the future. If so, whether he would benefit from surgical revascularisation of the kidneys. We are awaiting his expert opinion.

3. Patient realises that renal angiogram + angioplasty thro' radial artery carries its own risk. Risks of Cholesterol emboli, Contrast nephropathy, arterial injury, risk of further deterioration of his kidney function leading to early initiation of dialysis are explained. However patient feels that it worth taking a choice to prevent the kidneys from worsening rapidly by attempted angiopalsty.

4. We will obtain renal ultrasound to again measure his kidneys and to rule out any obstructive uropathy as the cause of renal dysfunction.

5. If patient is going for IR renal angiogram/plasty, then he will need Contrast prophylaxis.

We will review him tomorrow with Dr.Xi's opinon.

Renal Staff

I have seen and examined the patient twice today, and have reviewed his MR studies with radiology
In essence I agree with Dr Youngman's recs.

Patient has normal sized kidneys with insidious rise in Cr without obvious identifiable remediable causes.
He has severe aortic disease with occlusion of the aortia, mod severe bilateral claudication in LL.
His renal arteries have ostial stenoses bilaterally.

His options are:
1) conservative approach, and likely ESRD in the coming weeks
2) Radiological placements of bilateral stents via L brachial artery
3) Surgical bypass as a part of larger repair for LL claudication

We are in discussions with Radiology and Surgery to come up with a final recommendation which we will d/w patient tomorrow.

Cardiovascular Medicine Consult Service Consult Note
X. R. Xi, MD, PhD
Vascular Medicine Fellow, #45811

Date of Consultation: June 11, 2098

ID: 70 year old male from Missouri
Reason for Consult: Perioperative consultation prior to aorto-bifemoral bypass surgery

History of Present Illness:
	This 70 year old gentleman was diagnosed with an occluded distal aorta in mid-2097 after an attempt at cardiac catheterization via the femoral artery.  
	Over the last several months, he has had exercise limiting lower extremity pain     he describes primarily left leg burning (thigh, calf) when he walks, coming on over about 150 yards.  If he pushes further, he will also get right leg burning in a similar distribution. 
	He also has had a marked increase in CR over the past 8 monts (1.1 -> >4).  Based on non-invasive imaging, this has been attributed to renal artery stenosis.  His ACE-I (?ramipril) has  been held, without improvement.  A referral was recently made to rule out bilateral RAS, and he had an invasive aortogram yesterday.  There was an 85% proximal right RA stenosis, and a 40% left RA stenosis, perhaps only partially explaining the elevated Cr.  The angiogram also confirmed the occluded distal aorta (below the renal arteries, the SMA is patent).  An aortobifem plus right RA revascularization is planned.
	He has had reduced functional capacity for some time.  He gets claudication within 150 yards, but he also has been limited by exertional dyspnea.  He complains also of orthopnea (3 pillows), PND, as well as bilateral LE edema.  He also has noticed his weight continuing to creep up which he attributes to fluid retention.  He is avoiding salt, but not fluid restricting.  His lasix dose has not changed.  He has been angina free since his CABG surgery.  He has not had palpitations or AF since the immediate post-op period.  A ROS is otherwise unremarkable.

Past Medical History:
Coronary artery disease
MI 2084
Developed limiting angina in late 2096, early 2097
CABGx4 on November 05, 2097 (Dr. Ehlers)
CABG x 4 (LIMA - LAD/ Sequential graft: SVG1 connects Aorta to D1 then OM1/ SVG2 - LVB2

On coumadin for stroke prevention and amiodarone from maintenance of NSR
Currently in NSR
BPH
Chronic back pain
Renal insufficiency (Creatinine 4.1) non-oliguric - ?cause
Cr normal November 2097
Gradually increased over November from 1.1-1.6, ang then was ~4 when recently checked
Attributed to Renal artery stenosis based on non-invasive imaging (duplex, MRI), though 
Right inguinal hernia repair

Denies VTE, denies pulmonary problems.

Family History:
Noncontributory.

Social History:
Married, lives at home with his wife.  Exsmoker.  Minimal alcohol, no other substance abuse.

Review of Systems:
Noncontributary.

Physical Examination:
Mildly tachypnic RR 24.  BP 160/90 right arm.  HR 60 reg.  Afebrile.
Head and neck examination unremarkable.  No bruits heard.
JVP markedly elevated at the angle of the jaw.  The CP is delayed in upstroke, and mildly reduced in volume.  There is S1 S2 and a II/VI SEM that is high pitched and peaks in mid to late systole.  The Apex is hard to feel, but slight diffuse and sustained.  The abdomen is obese, distended, nontender, and there is no organomegaly or masses.  The patent   s distal pulses are difficult to feel, and despite the bilateral TEDS there is bilateral lower extremity edema.


Investigations:

EKG: Normal sinus rhythm
Note: Aortogram report is not on LMR

Na 140		WBC 6.59
K 4.3		HgB 8.0
Cl 104		Plt 165
CO2 25		Hct 25.8
BUN 80		INR 1.2 (coumadin held)
Cr 4.45		PTT 30.8
EGFR 13
Glu 74
Ca 8.3
Mg 2.4

Impression and Plan:

This gentleman is currently mild fluid overloaded (CHF) and hypertensive; this should be improved prior to any proposed surgery.  The issues include:
Congestive heart failure     I suspect there is worsening fluid retention primarily due to his worsening renal function.  I would consider:
increasing his diuretic (eg. Lasix 80 mg iv bid) to improve diuresis and get him euvolemic.  Hopefully this will work; if not, he should have ultrafiltration so that he is not in heart failure for his operation.  He will be at high risk of CHF post-op, and likely will need an ICU bed
consider starting hydralazine/nitroglycerin combination in lieu of ACE-inhibitor for afterload reduction
consider a pre-op echo     we probably should check his EF and bicuspid aortic valve to exclude severe AI and severe AS
Prevention of periperative MI
He should continue his ASA, atenolol, statins/zetia peri-operatively
No further testing for ischemia necessary unless is LV function on echo is markedly reduced (recent CABG, no angina)
Even with best medical care, for his proposed surgery and his comorbidities he carries a substantial risk for perioperative cardiac complications (roughly 5-10%)
Prevention of perioperative AF
Continue his atenolol and amiodarone perioperatively
Restart coumadin post-op for stroke prevention long term
Endocarditis prophylaxis
He will need perioperative antibiotics given his bicuspid aortic valve

We will follow with you     he may need a couple of days to treat his heart failure/fluid overload prior to surgery.

       Procedure: This 73 year old male with Cervical Herniation is scheduled for a Cervical Laminectomy with Fusion on Jan. 21, 2095 by Dr. Noah Blanchard



       Chief Complaint & History of Present Illness: This 73 year old gentleman has been  disabled assistance and wheelchair bound since 2066 when he suffered a compression fracture in a fall from a ladder at an amusement park.  He has been disabled but  has managed to stand  and get himself in and out of the wheelchair.  He began noticing cramps and tingling of both his upper extremities and they felt the same as before he had his cervical laminectomy in 2081. He was unable to grip his cup and began dropping objects. Nerve conduction studies were done in September 2094 the conclusion is that he has bilateral evidence of cervical polyradiculopathy right greater than the left.  evidence of sensory poly neuropathy there is also evidence to suggest a mild mean neuropathy at the wrists bilaterally





        Past Medical History:  

1.  Paraplegia secondary to Compression fracture in Amusement Park accident in 2066

2.  cervical spondylosis

3.  COPD uses prn Albuterol MDI

4.  CAD S/P CABG X3 in 2087 catheterization done in March 2090.  Recent stress done in May 2094

History of CABG, known hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, dyspnea on exertion, cancer, smoking. S/P B/L CEA, Cath '90 - occluded SVG to Cx, patent LIMA. patent SVG to RCA. Admitted with (L) sided chest pain, ruled out for MI by enzymes. Ruled out for aortic dissection by CT. Last Adeno-MIBI 3/2092 - posterior wall MI, Negative for ischemia. PURPOSE(S): Diagnosis of ischemia. DIAGNOSES: Primary diagnosis is chestpain. Additional diagnoses include hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia. MEDICATIONS: Albuterol, ECASA, Furosemide, Lopressor, Losartan. PROCEDURE: The patient underwent an adenosine stress test with exercise. Maximum adenosine dose: 140 ucg/kg/min. Supplemental arm exercise x 0:00 (min:sec). 1 lb hand held weight 1097MBq 99mTc sestamibi were injected intravenously following infusion of adenosine with exercise and tomographic imaging data acquired. Additional data were acquired following intravenous injection of another 406MBq 99mTc sestamibi at rest on the same day. Global LVEF was computed and qualitative assessment of regional systolic function was made. STRESS TEST RESULTS: DURATION @ MAX DOSE (min:sec) 5:00 HR (REST=>MAX) 56 => 74 (50% PREDICTED) BP (INITIAL=>PEAK) 150/60 => 150/60 (MINIMUM = 130/x) PEAK DOUBLE PRODUCT: 11100 ENDPOINT(S): The protocol was completed. Chest pain did not occur. REST ECG: The rest electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific ST segment and T-wave abnormalities. Sinus bradycardia 56/min. First degree AVB STRESS ECG: No ST segment changes were observed during this test. Arrhythmias: None STRESS TEST COMMENTS Negative for ischemia. However, the sensitivity of Adenosine-induced ST segment changes for detecting significant CAD is limited. SCAN RESULTS: The left ventricle is normal in size. There is a moderate reduction in tracer activity in the posterobasal wall of the left ventricle which persists after reinjection at rest. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 50% on the stress study. Regional wall motion abnormalities were noted in the posterior wall on the stress study. CONCLUSIONS: The ECG response to pharmacological stress was negative for ischemia. The myocardial scans show posterobasal infarction without ischemia--LVEF=50%.

               73 year old male with cervical disc herniation scheduled for Cervical  Laminectomy with fusion on Jan. 24, 2094 by Dr Blanchard.  He has co morbid diseases IDDM, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, COPD, Paraplegia, Hx of uti and depression. His last surgery was in 2092 ORIF left Tibia IV sedation with spinal anesthesia no complication noted in anesthesai record..  There has been difficulty placing the IV ( pt said this happens a lot). According to note from 3/07/81 anesthesia for previous cervical Laminectomy  Rapid sequence induction MAC #3 8.0 ETT easy intubation. Pt was a smoker for 50 years occasionally uses Albuterol with a spacer suggested he use it pre op .  He had a stress test done in May 2094 and it was negative for ischemia and a LVEF was 50%.  Report in this note under Medical Problems.  He was admitted for ""chest pain "" in May 2094 and he no longer is using the NTG sl or the Nitropace.  He was told the ""pains"" he feels is most likely from his CABG ( CABG X3)- Grafts to RCA patent,occluded at circumflex, LIMA patent and the post sternal pain. The stress test was done during this admission as well as a CAT scan to r/o aortic dissection. ( also negative)  his biggest problem seems to be his ""not very well controlled diabetes"".  There is a note from the May 2094 admission that he was to receive a trial of Nexium to see if his ""chest pain"" was epigastric"" but pt and wife said he never received this medication.  He denies any GERD or ""chest pain"" since may 2094.  He recognizes his hypoglycemia sx's and  also his hyper glycemia sx's ( blurred vision) when his blood sugar is 480.  He will not take his Glyburide the night before surgery and the morning of.. He will take 1/2 dose of Insulin the morning of 15 untis NPH.    He denies any medication allergies but staes that ""muscle relaxants"" cause his legs to become flaccid.

TEAM 2 ACCEPT NOTE

Patient's name: Frank Keatering	
MRN: 	4832978
Date of Admission to MICU: 	12/11/95
Date of transfer to Internal Medicine: 	12/13/95

ID/CC:  acute loss of motor/sensation at level of T8

History Obtained From: Pt, old charts, transfer note.

History of Present Illness:  74 y/o man with h/o paraplegia 2/2 compression fracture and wheelchair bound, vascular dz, with recent bilateral ileofemoral and renal artery stent (11/24/95) and recent cardiac cath stent to the circumflex (11/28/95). Pt presented to OSH 12/10 with c/o abdominal pain onset the PM prior to admission, diffuse in nature, localized in the mid-epigastric region, RUQ, and LUQ with a pain scale of 8-10/10 pain. Per charts he reported decreased pain in the am with ability to tolerate PO's and then increasing pain that afternoon. Also associated with diaphoresis, + nausea, no vomiting, no sob. During placement of a central line at OSH ED, pt experienced shaking during procedure and had acute loss of motor and sensory strength in the LE's. Per Nursing chart at OSH ED, pt given Morphine for abd pain (around 4p-8p) with coffee ground emesis at 8pm with subsequent decrease in BP to 76/49 and started on dopamine for pressure support. At the same time, pt c/o numbness in feet. Per charts he was reported to be bending forward coughing and vomiting and experienced acute loss of sensation/motor function in the abdomen and lower extremities.

Course at the outside hospital- 
1.Neuro- acute loss of sensation/motor at the level of T8. Per Neurology, had paraplegic legs, no sphincter tone, no anal wink, Sx were concerning for aortic dissection. Abd US unrevealing but was reported as a poor study. CT of T8-T10 did not show gross deviations of spine, no soft tissue masses or disk bulging.  
2.GI- Coffee ground emesis at OSH, with no fresh blood- with dropping HCT 44-40-35 and transfused 1 U pRBC on 12/11.  Also guiac +.  Etiology thought to be 2/2 ASA and plavix.  No egd was performed and amlyase and lipase, and LFTs were nl per report.  
3.ID- Pt was hypotensive with SBP in the 70's on presentation with good response to fluids, In setting of elevated WBC to 22 pt was empirically treated with Abx (zosyn, flagyl and vanc). BCx were sent and CXR appeared clear.
4.CARDIAC- Cardiac enzymes were followed with increasing Troponins: 0.04    0.07    0.08    0.09, CK index: 3.0    3.7. No complaints of chest pain during his stay. And no report of signifigant EKG changes. 
5.Renal- Creatinine increase from 2.6 to 3.1 thought to be 2/2 Acute on chronic RF.

Pt transferred to HOB for further eval of r/o dissection, r/o cord compression, GIB, poss abd ischemia, ARI/CRI

Review of System on admission: 
CV: no orthopnea, no PND
Resp: sob, no cough, no sputum production 
GI: abdominal pain as above, no melena, no BRBPR, able to have BM
GU: per OSH ED report of dark urine in ileostomy bag x2d with decreased UOP
Musculoskeletal: baseline decreased to minimal movement in the LLE, min-mod movement in right leg, able to transfer to and from wheelchair
Neuro/Psych: alert and oriented x3.

MICU Course:
1.Paraplegia:  Has baseline deficits (wheelchair bound), but unclear how they compare to current exam--> level at T5/T6.  
- first MRI showed low T2 signal collections from T6--> L1 with displacement of thoracic cord anteriorly from T7-T10. 
-no cord compression on repeat study, however ddx still includes cord infarction vs demyelinating disease
-neurosurg, neuro consulted, following
2.Respiratory status: Acute desaturation 2/2 methemoglobinemia as consequence of topical anesthetic
- s/p methylene blue (80 mg x 1, 40 mg x 1) with resolution of methemoglobin from 35% to 1%. 
3.Renal failure:  Possibilities raised include cholesterol emboli from recent interventions, relative hypoperfusion with normalization of blood pressure. 
- urine eos negative
- Cr 2.9-->2.5 today
4.Abdominal pain: mild-moderate stenosis just beyond origin of SMA seen on MRA; considered mesenteric ischemia a/w low flow state. However, lactic acid 1.3, and pH wnl 
- have liberalized bp parameters now that dissection ruled out
5.GI bleed: coffee ground emesis-- unclear if this reflects enteric ischemia vs. sentinel bleeding
-GI team consulted
6.Coronary artery disease:
- troponin 0.14 on admission, but subsequently all wnl, likely troponin leak in setting of GIB prior to admission
- taken off ASA, plavix in context of suspected UGIB
- cont lopressor 
- hydral, isordil, goal SBP 140-150
7.Hemodynamics:
- TEE with no dissection
- TTE with EF 54%, no SWMA, no tamponade
- metoprolol +/- isordil/hydral
8.Diabetes mellitus
- on MICU insulin protocol, will switch to sliding scale

MICRO: Urine, blood cx x 2 NGTD at HOB; VRE neg x1; MRSA nasal swab neg x1

EKG: NSR at 80, nl axis, old ST depressions in V4-5

CXR (12/13):  Stable chest without new or enlarging infiltrates or pneumonias.
	Cardiac size normal, no signs of edema or decompensation.
	Operative changes as before and right subclavian central line as
	before without apparent pneumothorax or complication.

MRI (12/12): 
EXAMINATION: MRI of the cervical, thoracic, lumbar spine.
	EXAMINATION DATE: 12/12/95.
	Comparison films: The prior films are available for comparison to
	due PACS technical difficulties. Comparison is made with the
	report of prior C-spine CT from January 2095.
	History:72 year old man with history of paraplegia from traumatic
	injury in 2066 with new sensation loss and motor loss below T8.
	Technique:Sagittal T2 images were obtained of the cervical,
	thoracic, lumbar spine.  The Axial T2 images are obtained from T10
	through L1. The images are moderately motion degraded in the
	thoracic and lumbar spine.  The cervical spine MRI was repeated
	three times due to motion. No contrast was used.
	Findings:
	CERVICAL SPINE:
	Straightening of the cervical lordosis is noted from C2 through
	C6. Bone marrow signal demonstrates patchy areas of T2 high signal
	within the C4 and C5 vertebral body.  Posterior disc osteophyte
	complexes are present at C2/C3, C3/C4, C4/C5, C5/C6, C6/C7.
	The patient is status post posterior laminectomy and fusion which
	causes susceptibility artifact. The laminectomy from C3 through
	C7, previously noted, is not well visualized due to motion
	artifact and susceptibility.
	THORACIC SPINE:
	There is partial fusion of T4 to T5 with loss of height of T4 and
	focal kyphosis at this area. Myelomalacia is noted from T1 through
	T5. There is focal T2 high signal within the cord substance at the
	T4 level.
	T2 low signal collections are noted posterior to the cord at T6
	through T12.  A high signal septation is present through this
	collection at T7 and extending from T11 through L1. This low T2
	signal collection displaces the cord anteriorly from T7 through
	T10.
	The cord is small from T7 through T10 consistent with myelomalacia
	and high T2 signal.
	High signal is also present in the cord substance of the distal
	thoracic cord and at the conus.
	Small amount of T2 high signal is noted in encircling the distal
	thoracic cord and the spinal roots.
	LUMBAR SPINE:
	Straightening of the lumbar spine is noted with grade 1
	retrolisthesis of L4 on L5. There is a levoscoliosis with apex at
	L4/L5.
	Disc demonstrates T2 shortening within several lumbar discs and
	disc height loss at L4/L5, L5/S1.
	T2 high signal at the endplates are noted around the L4/L5 and
	L5/S1 disc levels.   Moderate to severe stenosis of the bilateral
	neural foramen at L5/S1 facet osteoarthritis and disc height loss
	of L5/S1 is noted. The patient has had prior surgery of the
	spinous processes of L4 and L5.
	The conus terminates at L1/L2. The spinal roots appear clumped
	centrally and there is T2 high signal around the upper spinal
	roots. T2 high signal is noted at the distal aspect of the thecal
	sac.
IMPRESSION:
	 1.  Low T2 signal collections from T6 through L1 with
	displacement of the thoracic cord anteriorly from T7 through T10.
	The differential diagnosis for this collection includes unusual
	flow artifact or multiloculated septations or epidural
	collections.  Recommend dedicated thoracic and lumbar spine MRI
	with contrast and T2 axials through the L spine and C spine. If
	clinically indicated, consider repeat C spine MRI with contrast.
	Dr. Winters was informed of this at 2:15 PM on 12/12/95.
	2.  Myelomalacia of the thoracic cord from T4-T5 level and at
	T7-10.
	3.  The spinal roots are incompletely imaged but have a clumped in
	appearance suggesting arachnoiditis. Repeat axial images through
	the entire spinal roots could better evaluate this.
	4. Degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine at L4/L5 and
	L5/S1. degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine at C3/C4
	C4/C5 C5/C6.
	5.  Prior surgical fusion of the cervical spine and laminectomies
	are incompletely evaluated on the study due to motion.  Please see
	prior CT report for the details.
	6.  Mild focal kyphosis with height loss at T4 appears subacute
	and may be from prior trauma.

MRI (12/13):	
MRI THORACIC AND LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM
	History: History of previous cord compression. Status post recent
	aorto-bifemoral bypass. Now with sudden onset of loss of lower
	extremity motor function and sensation.
	Comparison: MRI spine dated 12/12/95.
	Procedure: Multiplanar MR imaging of the entire spine was
	performed without and with Gadolinium.
	Findings:
	There is an old compression fracture at T5.  There is exaggeration
	of the normal kyphosis at this level.  There is no evidence of
	marrow edema to suggest acute fracture in the spine.  There is
	straightening of the normal lumbar lordosis.  There is grade 1
	retrolisthesis of L4 on L5.  There is degenerative change in the
	L4-5 and L5-S1 end plates.  There is increased T2 signal in the
	L4-5 and L5-S1 discs however the adjacent endplates are well
	preserved, and although infection cannot be completely excluded,
	it is considered very unlikely.  There is a small central disc
	protrusion at T8-9.
	There is no evidence of significant canal stenosis in the thoracic
	or lumbar spine.
	Examination of the cord demonstrates myelomalacia extending from
	the T5 level inferiorly.  There is prominent flow artifact in the
	CSF surrounding the myelomalacic cord.  The conus is expanded and
	demonstrates hyperintensity on T2 weighted sequences.  There is no
	associated enhancement.  No vascular flow voids are identified.
	There is a small right pleural effusion.  There is consolidation
	at the right lung base.  This may represent atelectasis or
	infiltrate and correlation with chest x-ray is recommended.
IMPRESSION:
	Expansion and signal abnormality in the conus superimposed on
	chronic myelomalacia. The differential diagnosis includes cord
	infarction, and demyelinating disease.  Vascular malformation and
	neoplasm are considered less likely due to the absence of vascular
	flow voids and abnormal enhancement.


MRA:  MRA of the aorta with runoff was conducted as per departmental
	protocol.
	FINDINGS:
	Due to the nature of MRI imaging, dedicated sequences were
	performed to evaluate the vasculature. The remainder of the
	abdominal organs are not fully evaluated and if clinically
	indicated, directed sequences could be performed.
	This was a technically limited study due to suboptimal contrast
	bolus and movement.  The patient was agitated and unable to
	cooperate .
	No evidence for an aortic dissection is identified.
	There is moderate stenosis of the left subclavian artery just
	beyond its origin.
	The celiac trunk is patent.
	There is mild/moderate stenosis just beyond the origin of the
	superior mesenteric artery.
	The renal arteries cannot be assessed on this study.
IMPRESSION:
	1.  Limited study due to technical factors and patient movement
	however no evidence of an aortic dissection is identified.  A
	repeat MRI with better contrast bolus and sedation may be obtained
	if clinically indicated.
	2.  Moderate stenosis is noted just distal to the origin of the
	left subclavian artery.
3.	Mild/moderate stenosis just beyond the origin of the SMA.

Assessment/Plan: 74 y/o vasculopath presenting with new neurological deficits, abdominal pain, UGI bleed, progressive renal failure, initially worrisome for aortic dissection. Unifying diagnosis remains obscure- ? occlusive atheroemboli vs epidural hematoma.

1.Paraplegia: Has baseline deficits (wheelchair bound), but unclear how they compare to current exam--> level at T5/T6. First MRI showed low T2 signal collections from T6--> L1 with displacement of thoracic cord anteriorly from T7-T10; no cord compression on repeat study, however ddx still includes cord infarction vs demyelinating disease
-neurology and neurosurgery following
-awaiting spinal CT to evaluate for epidural hematoma
-in addition, neurology has asked for MRI with line diffusion and MPGR sequence to r/o infarction, which has been ordered

2.Respiratory status: Acute desaturation 2/2 methemoglobinemia as consequence of topical anesthetic; s/p methylene blue (80 mg x 1, 40 mg x 1) with resolution of methemoglobin from 35% to 1%, now on 4L NC sats are 95%.
-cont O2 and wean as tolerated
-enter hurricane spray as allergy

3.Renal failure:  Possibilities raised include cholesterol emboli from recent interventions, relative hypoperfusion with normalization of blood pressure. No contrast at OSH; urine eos negative; FENa= 0.94%; Cr 3.1    2.5 today
-follow Cr

4.Abdominal pain: mild-moderate stenosis just beyond origin of SMA seen on MRA; considered mesenteric ischemia a/w low flow state. However, lactic acid 1.3, and pH wnl 
- will follow acid/base status, lytes, pain

5.GI bleed: coffee ground emesis-- unclear if this reflects enteric ischemia vs. ulcer in setting of plavix, ASA
-GI team following, planning on probable EGD 12/15
-holding ASA, plavix for now

6.Cards- ISCHEMIA: troponin 0.14 on admission, but subsequently all wnl, likely troponin leak in setting of GIB prior to admission
- off ASA, plavix in context of suspected UGIB
- maintain Hct > 30
- cont lopressor 
PUMP: TEE with no dissection; TTE with EF 54%, no SWMA, no tamponade
- metoprolol, isordil/hydral goal SBP 140-150
RHYTHM - NSR

7.Diabetes mellitus: sliding scale QID
- will convert to NPH once requirements determined

8.FEN: resume diet as EGD likely on Monday

9.Prophylaxis: cont nexium, holding fragmin given concern for bleeding

10.Dispo: Will need rehab once stable; PT/OT

CC/ID: 74 yo male with Abdomainal pain



HPI:  74 yo who was in 11/96 HOB for abdominal pain and worsening of this incomplete paraplegia.  For more details please see HOB d/c summary 12-11-95 and his Lakeland Hospital d/c summary from 5-19-2096.  As an inpatient he developed a sacral decubitus ulcer which became large.  During his rehab stay at LH, he was being followed by they HOB wound clinic for management of his sacral ulcer with a vac dressing.  The wound progressed until he presented to the EW 8/96 with frank fecal contamination of a stage 4 ulcer.  He thus had a diverting colostomy on 8/23/96 to allow his ulcer to heal.  he presented to the EW today with one day of abdominal pain, distention and nausea.

BCH SURGERY EW EVALUATION



HPI: Mr. Keating is a 75 year-old male with a complex medical history which includes a history of a stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer, secondary to being bedridden due to paraplegia (due to injury in 2066).  His ulcer was eroding into his rectum and therefore he underwent sigmoid colostomy 8/96 for diversion.  He is also s/p ileal loop urostomy in the distant past.  Was seen in plastics clinic today, decub progressing well, but poor POs, referred for admission.  Denies N/V, has had normal ostomy output, denies abd pain, though he did have some cramping several days ago.  His main complaint is long-standing back pain.  Of note, he had been readmitted about 2 weeks postop with distention and pain, CT showing partial SBO and a pelvic fluid collection, which was drained, cultures were sterile.  Wife noted some discharge from midline wound several days ago, but this has ceased.

Dear Dr. Null, 

I had the pleasure of seeing Nick Hall in WSH cardiology clinic today in follow-up of his recent admission to the ICMA.  While I know that you are familiar with his history, please allow me to briefly review it for my records.  He is a lovely 53 year old gentleman whose history is remarkable for Hodgkins, status post mantle radiation in the early 70's; coronary artery disease, status post-PCI to the LAD and RCA in '90 and '87, respectively, and recently diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer.  MIBI done at LMC 1/24/94 showed normal EF without perfusion defects (no scar or ischemia); he exercised 10:30 on a standard Bruce iwthout symptoms.  He was admitted 2/94 for elective left upper lobectomy for his squamous cell lung cancer (ASA was stopped 1 week prior to surgery; he was not on plavix preop); in PACU following resection, he had a VT/VF arrest and was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab, where he was found to have a massive volume of thrombus extending throughout his RCA.  After extensive suction catheter use and POBA, a good angiographic result was obtained; no stents were placed due to the heightened thrombotic state that he was in.  Remarkably, echocardiogram revealed normal LV systolic function, with basal inferoposterior HK noted.  His peak TnI was 33.6, his peak CK was 1710, and his peak MB was 87.2.  He had a relatively unremarkable course post-catheterization; plavix initiation was delayed until his chest tube was removed, after which it was started without incident.  He was discharged 2/11/94, and returns today for routine follow-up.  

Regarding his squamous cell lung cancer, it is my understanding that he had no evidence of metastatic disease and that margins were negative; he is not currently planned for any adjuvant therapy, but will be closely followed.  Regarding his remote history of Hodgkins, he is followed at RFPC, and is due for an annual visit there in the next 1-2 months.  

He has been walking outside for the past ~2 weeks (since the weather improved), walking about 2 miles in around 30 minutes.  He feels well, and has had no problems.  He notes some mild dyspnea with increased exertion (climbing hills), but denies any unusual dyspnea.  He denies chest pain, SOB at rest, orthopnea (stable 2 pillow use), PND, edema, palpitaitons, or claudication.  He brings with him a handwritten record of his recent hemodynamics - his BP runs in the 100-120's/60-80's, with rare systolics in the 130's.  His heart rate has been in the 70-80's.  

His past medical history includes:
 CAD s/p IMI '88 (totally occluded RCA with good collaterals, revascularized with 3 stents to the RCA), MI '90 (LAD stent), inferior STEMI 2/94 as above s/p POBA
 VF arrest in setting of STEMI
 Hodgkin's '81 - splenectomy, XRT
 LUL squamous cell cancer s/p L upper lobectomy 2/94
 hyperlipidemia (low HDL and high LDL - tried niaspan in the past without much benefit)
 hypothyroid
 basal cell skin CA
 nephrolithiasis

His medications include:
 Lipitor 80 mg
 Plavix 75 mg
 ASA 325 mg po QD
 Lopressor 200 mg po BID
 Prilosec 20 mg

He has a history of intolerance (dizziness) with lisinopril.

His family history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension, but negative for CAD.

He works in consulting, and travels around the Midwest as part of his job.  He is now back at work.  He is married, and lives in Lincoln City.  He and his wife have 4 children, ages 15 / 17 / 20 / 24; they have no pets.  He has never smoked cigarettes.  He drinks 3 glasses of wine/week, and a cup of coffee qam.

On physical exam today, he has a heart rate of 68 and a blood pressure of 134/75.  He is a well developed well nourished gentleman in no apparent distress.  His JVP is flat sitting at 90 degrees, and he has no carotid bruits.  His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallups.  His abdomen is benign.  He is warm and well perfused peripherally without significant edema, and with 2+ PT pulses bilaterally.

His EKG in clinic today is NSR at 68, with possible LAE, a nonspeciifc IVCD, and inferior Q waves in III/F, consistent with an inferior MI.  He has increased voltages consistent with LVH.

His recent cardiac tests include: 
 - echo 2/94 - EF 60%, basal inferoposterior HK, normal atrai, no significant valvular disease
 - cath 2/94 - right dominant system, patent LAD stent, proximal 60% LCx, proximal 90% thrombotic RCA occlusion (in-stent) with 100% ostial R-PDA thrombotic lesion s/p Angiojet/POBA with TIMI-3 excellent angiographic result 

In summary, this is a 53 year old man who had a VF arrest in the setting of perioperative inferior STEMI, status post extensive angiojet and POBA of acute in-stent thrombosis of presumed bare metal stents in his RCA.  He is asymptomatic from a cardiovascular standpoint, and somewhat remarkably did not take a large myocardial hit from this life-threatening event.  Our attention now shifts to the prevention of future events.  Given the degree of thrombus burden in his RCA at the time of cath, he is someone for whom we would strongly advise lifelong plavix and aspirin.  Furthermore, he is not someone for whom I would be comfortable with even temporary discontinuation of one of these agents - we would advise that ANY future procedures be done on aspirin and plavix.  His blood pressure and heart rate are well controlled on his current regimen, as demonstrated by his home records.  I have taken the liberty today of changing him from lopressor 200 bid to toprol 200 bid to minimize any ups and downs in his beta blockade, but otherwise, would not make any changes to his regimen at this time.  We will check a full set of labs today, but I suspect that no further changes will be required at this time.  

Given his history of Hodgkin's, as well as his known CAD, he is clearly at risk for future events, and I suspect that we will take a rather aggressive stance in terms of monitoring for ischemia.  Certainly, if he has any concerning symptoms, we would have a low threshold to pursue an aggressive course.  At present, however, I am delighted with how well he is doing.  

It was a pleasure to see Mr. Hall in cardiology clinic today.  I will plan to see him in follow-up in 6 months time, but he knows to call sooner should he have any problems or concerns.  

Regards,

management with Dr. Gil, who will be speaking with Dr. Gomez

about accepting this patient to the Cardiology Service.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 54-year-old gentleman who

has a history of stent placements as he had a cardiac arrest

status post lobectomy for squamous cell carcinoma.  This occurred

in 02/2094, where the patient was taken to the Cath Lab after His

postoperative rest.  Stents were placed and the patient says he

has been doing well.  In the meantime, he has had no chest pain

or shortness of breath until one week prior, he was on a

treadmill and felt unwell with shortness of breath and chest

discomfort.  He stopped and felt better.  Last night, he was in

bed watching TV, he felt some chest discomfort and took

nitroglycerin with relief of pain, and this morning he was

walking and walked about 100 yards, felt short of breath and

chest pain at rest and took nitroglycerin with relieve and now

has no chest pain or shortness of breath at this time.  His chest

pain he describes it as pressure with exertion and he feels well

now.  No fevers, chills, or cough.

Dear Dr. Null, 


I had the pleasure of seeing Nick Hall in WSH cardiology clinic today in follow-up for his known coronary artery disease and recent admission to Wytheville South with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.  As I'm sure you recall, he is a lovely 54 year old gentleman whose history of Hodgkins disease status-post mantle radiation in the early 70's, squamous cell lung cancer status post left upper lobectomy 1/94, and coronary artery disease, status post-PCI to the LAD and RCA in '90 and '87, respectively, and perioperative VT/VF arrest at the time of his LUL resection 1/94.  At that time, emergent catheterization revealed massive volume of thrombus extending throughout his RCA, managed with extensive suction catheter use and POBA, with a good angiographic result.  No stents were placed given the thrombus burden.  Remarkably, subsequent echocardiogram revealed normal LV systolic function, with basal inferoposterior HK noted.  His peak TnI was 33.6, his peak CK was 1710, and his peak MB was 87.2.  He had a relatively unremarkable course post-catheterization; plavix initiation was delayed until his chest tube was removed, after which it was started without incident.  He was discharged 2/11/94, and had done well until 1/31/2095, when he presented to WSH with unstable angina, having noted new sudden onset angina and dyspnea while making his daily walk.  He had a positive troponin, and was taken urgently to cardiac catheterization, which revealed a proximal LAD lesion (felt to be the culprit) and ostial RCA lesion, both of which were stented with CYPHER stents.  At that time the decision was made to increase his plavix from 75 to 150 as an attempt to maximize his medical management, given his history and disease burden.  


Since that admission, he has done exceedingly well, and presents today without complaints.  He continues to walk 2 miles ~4 times/week without exertional symptoms.  He specifically denies chest pain, dyspnea, orthopnea, PND, or lower extremity edema.  He has had no palpitations, dizziness/presyncope, or claudication.  He has significantly modified his diet to eliminate dairy and hydrogenated products/snacks, with a 5# weight loss, and is motivated to further reduce his weight.  He states that he feels ""great"" and isdoing quite well.  He does not that occasionally at this work, when he is frustrated/upset, he will take his pressure and find his systolic to be ~150, but this comes down within minutes if he relaxes, and his pressures are great at home.  He has had no GI symptoms on the aggressive antiplatelet regimen, despite not being on a PPI.


Regarding his squamous cell lung cancer, it is my understanding that he had no evidence of metastatic disease and that margins were negative; he is not currently planned for any adjuvant therapy, but will be closely followed.  His most recent imaging was 11/94, which was negative for evidence of metastasis by repor.  Regarding his remote history of Hodgkins, he is followed at RFPC on an annual basis.  


His past medical history includes:
  CAD s/p IMI '88 (totally occluded RCA with good collaterals, revascularized with 3 stents to the RCA), MI '90 (LAD stent), inferior STEMI 2/94 as above s/p POBA
  VF arrest in setting of STEMI
  Hodgkin's '81 - splenectomy, XRT
  LUL squamous cell cancer s/p L upper lobectomy 2/94
  hyperlipidemia (low HDL and high LDL - tried niaspan in the past without much benefit)
  hypothyroid
  basal cell skin CA
  nephrolithiasis


His medications include:
  Lipitor 80 mg
  Plavix 150 mg
  ASA 325 mg po QD
  Toprol 200 mg po BID
  Levoxyl
  Omega-3-fatty acids
  Multivitamin


He has a history of intolerance (dizziness) with lisinopril.


His family history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension, but negative for CAD.


He works in consulting, and travels around the midwest as part of his job.  He also works a few days a week at the local supermarket cashiering , and works as a museum docent a few times a week.  He is married, and lives in Lincoln City.  He and his wife have 4 children, ages 15 / 17 / 20 / 24; they have no pets.  He has never smoked cigarettes.  He drinks 1 glass of wine a night.


On physical exam today, he has a heart rate of 75 and a blood pressure of 129/81, with a weight of 220#.  He is a well developed well nourished gentleman in no apparent distress.  His JVP is ~7-8 cm; he has no carotid bruits.  His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and a physiologically split S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallups.  His abdomen is benign.  He is warm and well perfused peripherally without significant edema, and with 2+ PT pulses bilaterally.


His EKG in clinic today is NSR at 75 with possible left atrial abnormality, a nonspeciifc IVCD, and inferior Q waves in III/F, consistent with an inferior MI. 


In summary, this is a 54 year old man who had a VF arrest in the setting of perioperative inferior STEMI, status post extensive angiojet and POBA of acute in-stent thrombosis of presumed bare metal stents in his RCA, who represented 1 year later (1/95) with NSTEMI now s/p PCI to his RCA and LAD.  He is now asymptomatic status post this intervention  Given his history, we agree with antiplatelet therapy, with a plan for lifelong plavix and aspirin.  Should he require future invasive diagnostic procedures, it would be reasonable to decrease doses to 75 plavix/81 ASA, but we would not favor DC of either of these medications altogether.  His blood pressure and heart rate are well controlled on his current regimen, as demonstrated by his home records.  His LDL is near goal, with a low HDL that was unaffected by high-dose niaspan in the past.  I share his hope that with further diet/weight loss and exercise, these will both improve to goal.  


As I have discussed with he and his wife, given his history of Hodgkin's, as well as his known CAD, he is clearly at risk for future events, including the possibility of bypass surgery in the future.  We will be guided by his symptoms, and he knows to call me if he has any problems/symptoms.  It was a pleasure to see Mr. Hall in cardiology clinic today.  I will plan to see him in follow-up in 6 months time, but he knows to call sooner should he have any problems or concerns.

Dear Dr. Nall:


It was a pleasure to see Nick Hall again in the Cardiology clinic at Wytheville South Hospital in followup of his post myocardial infarction care.  As you are well aware, he has many coronary risk factors.  He is a 55-year-old gentleman with past history Hodgkin's disease, status post mantle radiation in the early 2070s and left upper lobe lobectomy in 2094 for early stage squamous cell lung cancer that was complicated by VT/VF arrest.  He has history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, as well as overweight.  He does not have a former history of type 2 diabetes, but on recent screening, his hemoglobin A1c has been elevated at 8%.  His prior history of coronary artery disease dates back to 2087 and 2090 when he had non-ST elevation MI and coronary interventions to his LAD and RCA.  He has subsequently had a VT/VF arrest during his lobectomy in 2094, which required emergent coronary angiographic resuscitation where he was found to have a massive thrombus throughout his right coronary artery that required thrombectomy and POBA with good results.  He remarkably has had a preserved LV function after all of these infarctions with only some basal inferoposterior hypokinesis.  In 01/2095, he developed recurrent exertional and then unstable angina, presented to Wytheville Sanitarium Hospital Emergency where he was considered to be high risk acute coronary artery syndrome with positive troponins and proceeded to the catheterization clinic where he again had proximal LAD and RCA occlusions, both which were intervened with drug-eluting Cypher stents with good results.  Since then, he has been doing well and has been instructed to be on double dose clopidogrel 150 mg lifelong and full dose aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily lifelong.


We see him in followup today, and again, he has no limitations in his exertional capacity.  Work has been tough in consulting and he is now working 2 jobs including overnight shifts, which is strenuous at times.  He is looking for work as a dog walker and will find out soon whether he can quit his evening jobs and will be able to increase his exercise capacity such that he will be doing more walking with that job.  He has no chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, presyncope, or syncope with exertion.  He has no signs or symptoms of heart failure.  He has been taking his blood pressures at home, which range at about 126/81 to 142/92 with an average of 135/85.  His heart rates have been in 50s-70s.  He has had no side effects to his medications.  He is not smoking and he is not drinking alcohol.  He says that he walks for 2-3 miles when the weather is nice, but given that it has been a harsh winter, he has not been doing this often.


His current medications, aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily, clopidogrel 150 mg p.o. daily, atorvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily, levothyroxine 125 mcg p.o. daily, and metoprolol sustained release 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.


Physical Examination: Nick looked well.  His weight was 232 pounds, his blood pressure was 153/89 in the right arm and 150/95 in the left arm with a large cuff, and his heart rate was 69 and regular.  His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure and normal carotid upstroke and contour.  There are no bruits.  His chest is clear to auscultation.  He was not clubbed.  His cardiovascular exam revealed a normal left apex and normal S1 and S2 with no additional gallops, rubs, or murmurs.  He had no peripheral edema.  His abdomen was soft and nontender with no organomegaly.  His pulses were palpable 2+ throughout.


EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm, heart rate 61, minimal voltage criteria for LVH and left atrial enlargement.  Prior inferior Q-wave MI.


Lab values from today:  His electrolyte panel was notable for sodium 144, potassium 4.1, chloride 107, bicarb 28, creatinine 1, urea 16, normal calcium, normal LFTs, and normal CK level.  TSH was also normal.  Hemoglobin A1c was elevated at 6.8%.


Lipid levels:  Total cholesterol 164, TG 145, HDL 33, LDL 102.


Echocardiogram from last year revealed normal LV ejection fraction of 60%-65%.  Mild left atrial enlargement, no LVH.


Impression:  Nick is still borderline hypertensive, and in the setting of having survived multiple myocardial infarctions, Hodgkin lymphoma and now declaring himself as potential glucose intolerant and early diabetic, I think it is time to start an ACE inhibitor as we have discussed previously.  We started him on ramipril 2.5 mg today and he will increase that to 5 mg a day after tolerating it for 2 weeks.  He will take his blood pressures at home few times a week.  To simplify and decrease his beta-blocker regimen we switched to atenolol 100mg daily today.  We also discussed increasing his lipid management by adding niacin again starting at 500 mg extended release for a month and then he will increase that to 1 g a day.  He was cautioned on the adverse potential reactions of facial flushing and headache and he was instructed to take his aspirin 325 about 30 minute prior to his niacin to minimize these potential side effects.


With regards to his coronary artery disease, all this time we have assumed that his atherosclerosis has been secondary to high dose radiation exposure when he was a child.  Nevertheless, Dr. Turner had a great suggestion that we screen him for quantitative platelet function inhibition, given we recently started performing this test at WSH and previously had recurrence on normal strength doses of clopidogrel and aspirin.  The results may not changes our current management strategy, but it may give us insight into his premature CAD etiology, particularly coronary artery thrombus, as well as play a future role in familial screening.  To that end, we have requested light transmission aggregometry for platelet function inhibition.  We have also requested a thrombophilia workup, including factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, protein C and S levels, antithrombin level and homocysteine and CRP today.


Otherwise, I believe Nick is doing well.  We will see him again in 6 months' time with follow up on these studies.  If by then he still has evidence of diabetes, and trouble losing weight, we will refer him to our nutritionist for counseling and refer him to hadley memorial hospital.  He may need a structured monitored exercise program in order to help improve his exercise capacity.  


This patient was discussed with Dr. Turner in clinic.


Yours sincerely,

Dear Dr. Nall:



It was a pleasure to see Nick again in the Internal Medicine at Wytheville South Hospital on 06/14/2098 for routine folow up of radiation associated ischemic heart disease.  


As you know, Nick had mantle radiation in his youth for Hodgkin's lymphoma, and subsequently had 2 NSTEMIs in 2087 and 2090.  He received bare-metal stents to his LAD and RCA and did well until 2094 when after diagnosis and resection of a squamous cell lung carcinoma, his postop course was immediately complicated by an acute inferior STEMI/VT/VF arrest.  Immediate angiography post-resuscitation found massive thrombus burden in his proximal right coronary artery, with good result after thrombectomy and POBA, in addition to Integrilin, aspirin, Plavix, and low dose heparin.  Remarkably, after an IABP and aggressive care Nick walked away with a preserved LV function after this event.  He did well until 01/2095 when he represented with unstable angina and was found to have in-stent restenosis in the ostial LAD and the ostial RCA bare-metal stents.  He was treated with Cypher drug-eluting stents to both lesions (3.5 x 18 mm Cypher stent post dilated to 20 atm to the LAD and 3.5 x 23 mm extending slightly into the sinus of Valsalva to the RCA) with no residual stenosis.  Because of concerns with regards to recurrent in-stent restenosis he was put on dual antiplatelet therapy (325mg ECASA and clopidogrel 150 mg) since that event intended as longterm therapy.  He has been followed by me since 2095 with no recurrent ischemic heart disease, chest pain, and has returned to normal exercise capacity and with preserved cardiac systolic function.  


Nick continues to be very successful as a technology consultant in IBM research in Leland.  As the economy is picking up, his work environment has improved as has his stress level.  He is walking every day both at work and recreationally and lost another 5pounds.  He takes his medications regularly and is usually compliant  but ran out of atenolol last week and instead has been taking bid ramipril in its place.  Every year he asks whether we can down-titrate his clopidogrel both for tolerance and cost reasons (I reassured him that it should be generic within a year).  Nevertheless, we tested the degree of platelet inhibition he currently has with the VerifyNow P2Y12 PRU assay, and his result was 177, which is below the cut-off of 230 PRU thought to approximate adequate platelet inhibition.
  He recently had some transient melena for which he was placed on ranitidine.




His current medications should be aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily, clopidogrel 150 mg p.o. daily, atorvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily, ramipril 10 mg p.o. daily, atenolol 50 mg p.o. daily, L-thyroxine 125 mcg p.o. daily, ranitidine 150 mg po daily, 1 tablet fish oil daily, and 1 tablet of vitamin D daily. 
He has no known drug allergies.




Physical Examination:  Nick looks well.  He is in no distress. Weight is 221 lbs.  Blood pressure is 150/80 in the right arm repeated over 3 manual measurements with a large manual cuff and his heart rate is 70 and regular.  His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure, normal carotid upstroke and contour with no bruits.  His chest is clear to auscultation.  His cardiovascular exam demonstrated normal left apex and normal first and second heart sounds with a normal splitting of the second heart sound with no additional gallops, rubs, or murmurs.  He had no peripheral edema.  His abdomen is soft and nontender with no organomegaly.  He had 2+ pulses in the peripheral exam.



EKG today demonstrated sinus rhythm at 88 bpm with voltage criteria for LVH, LAE and prior inferior Q-waves.


We are awaiting an updated lipid profile due this week before modifying his lipid therapy which is aimed to target a goal of less than 70 mg/dL.  He has tried and failed a trial of niacin in the past due to intolerable flushing and headache.  His LDL last year was 98 mg/dL though HDL has improved to 37 mg/dL. His TC/HDL ratio is 4.2, his TC is 155 mg/dL, and TG 101 mg/dL.  HbA1c is 7.2%.


The previous echo in 2096 demonstrated normal LV size and function with a normal LV ejection fraction of 60%-65% with no signs of LVH.



Impression:  Nick is doing well with CCS 1 symptoms after repeated MIs most recently in 2095 due to accelerated coronary atheroclerosis and radiation stenoses.  


To target his coronary risk factors, I recommended the following:

1.  Should his LDL be &gt;70mg/dL he should switch to rosuvastatin 40mg daily for LDL and HDL improvement.

2.  Given clopidorel platelet reactivity is less than 230 PRU he will decrease to 75 mg daily and we will re-check his PRU activity after at least 7 days on this dose.  Should PRU &gt; 230 he will either need to restart 150 mg daily and take a PPI like pantoprazole or switch to prasugrel (or when available ticagrelor).
3.  He will continue a healthy heart diet and exercise and we will see him again in 6 months.



Thank you for allowing me to participate in his care.  As I am not continuing a general out-patient clinic next year, Nick will transition to another cardiologist who can accomodate his day off from work which is typically on Saturday.  


The patient was discussed in clinic with Dr. Neale Xiao who agreed with this plan.



Yours sincerely,

Date of Evaluation:  12/13/78
Attending:  Dr. Atwood

CC:  L leg/foot pain

History of Present Illness: Pt is a 71 yo M s/p bilateral fem-pop BPG   s by Dr. Atwood who had been previously asymptomatic walking up to five miles without claudication, after his R BPG in Feb and L BPG in April of this year.  He in fact saw Dr. Atwood on 11/10 and had a good DP pulse at that time on the left.  However, one week ago he sat on the floor for ~3 hours doing electrical work, flexed at the hip and slightly flexed at the knee, and that night he began to have calf and dorsal foot pain on the L side.  This lasted for ~24 hours.  He went to his PCP who was concerned that he may have compromised his graft given he had a diminished DP pulse on the L, and also had developed an area of erythema on the L lateral calf which the PCP suspected to be cellulitis.  He was prescribed keflex by his PCP which he started on 12/10, and the patient reports his erythema has improved since starting the abx.  He then revisited Dr. Atwood who found diminished trace DP pulse on the L, possibly secondary to graft kinking and/or thrombosis, and advised the patient to be admitted today for likely angiogram and possible thrombolysis in the AM.  On ROS he has had no F/C/N/V/D/abd pain/back pain.

Mr. Vieira presented to Dr. Atwood clinic 
today with persistent wound collection in the below knee popliteal incision. He noticed a lump approximately 3 weeks ago, underwent incision and drainage with wick placement and started a course of PO antibiotics. This has continued to drain serosanguinous fluid, apparently the overall induration and erythema with some additional fluid under moderate pressure was released. He has been seen daily by a visiting nurse and she can do the dressing, replacing the wick, and putting a sterile absorbent dressing on top of this. We will see him again in another week.
  He is on coumadin, last dose 3.5 last night. 

Denies fevers chills, SOB, cough.

MRN: 0666729
Date: 3/8/2081


HPI: This is a 74 y.o. M with h.o CAD and PVD s/p bilateral lower extremity bypass grafting procedures complicated by a thrombus in the L side of the iliac portion of the graft for which he has been on coumadin. In anticipation for a follow-up cardiac catheterization (recent episodes of shortness of breath), his coumadin was held since Thursday (3/6/2081). Then on 3/7/2081, he was noted by medical staff to have a slightly cool L lower extremity. The patient states that it has felt this way with some intermittent pain at rest for the last several weeks. He complained of both numbness and pain, and he was started on a heparin drip when his INR fell to less than 2.0. Dr. Atwood who did his initial operation was contacted and he was arranged for transfer to RCH. He arrives today (3/8/2081) on a heparin drip.

Consult for radial artery harvest



HPI:  74 RHD M with coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, Type II DM, peripheral arterial disease and prior cigarette abuse  admitted to the Vascular Surgery service on 3/8 with critical limb ischemia. On 03/09/2081, he underwent peroneal and popliteal angioplasty with thrombolysis of the femoral-popliteal bypass graft and stenting of the proximal anastomosis by Dr. Godfrey.  This was complicated by a postoperative MI. 03/15/2081, cardiac catheterization 
is significant for left main and multivessel coronary artery disease, and CABG was planned.  Of note, his cath was complicated by pseudoaneurysm of the right brachial artery at the point of access.   He was evaluated by SonoSite by the cardiac surgical PA, and was found to have no available venous conduit secondary to his multiple lower extremity procedures.  We are therefore consulted for radial artery harvest.

HPI: Kadeem Vicente comes in today for a follow-up office visit.  The 
patient was seen by me approximately one month ago as a new patient and 
whose primary medical concerns a history of coronary artery disease, for 
which he suffered a ""silent heart attack"" many years ago, a history of 
benign prostatic hypertrophy, as well as hypertension and GERD.  As it 
turns out, the patient had been on Zantac for many, many years, the 
beneficial effects of which were unknown.  We had decided as of our last 
meeting to stop this drug and find out if he became symptomatic.  The 
patient reports today that he is not symptomatic, and thus we will 
continue to discontinue this medicine.  At this point, the patient does 
not need the addition of a proton pump inhibitor, such as Prilosec.  
With regard to the patient's symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, 
the patient said that he only has taken one dose of the Hytrin, since he 
wanted to use up all his Minipress, which he tool up until 2 nights ago.  
Thus it is too early to assess the efficacy of this medication.  It is 
noted that his blood pressure was 152/74, which is better than it was 
the last time he was here, which the systolic range was 160-170 and 
diastolic was 80-90.  The patient reports no new symptomatology other 
than occasional fatigue, from which he will have to rest.  The patient 
has no symptoms of congestive heart failure, no shortness of breath, no 
ankle edema, no JVD by observation, and his laboratory results are 
remarkably normal, given his medical complaints.  The patient's 
cholesterol is 190 with a slightly above average triglycerides.  Review 
of systems otherwise negative.
 
Physical exam is not performed at this time.  Blood pressure was 152/76 
on the right, 152/76 on the left, temperature was 96.8, respirations 20 
and unlabored, and pulse was 70.
 
ASSESSMENT/PLAN: This is a 75 year old man with multiple medical 
problems coming in for follow-up.
1.   Hypertension - the patient will stay on his Zestril and will use 
     Hytrin now, both for his hypertension, as well as benign prostatic 
     hypertrophy.  The patient does speak of some nocturnal dribbling, 
     and he said he also has urge incontinence, particularly while 
     standing.  The patient was told that after a trial of Hytrin, which 
     hopefully can help with his symptoms of benign prostatic 
     hypertrophy, that this urge incontinency will also be helped.  If 
     the patient's symptoms continue beyond this, he will be referred to 
     Urology for possible TUNA procedure.
 
2.   BPH - please see above.  The patient will stay on Hytrin for now.
 
3.   ? coronary artery disease - the patient's cholesterol is 190 with a 
     slightly above average triglycerides, which is more than acceptable 
     for this gentleman.  I do not have an HDL in which to judge his 
     ratio, but I was by the patient before that it runs in the high 40s

     or low 50s.  Therefore this will be an acceptable ratio without 
     therapy.  I will get a fasting lipid on the patient probably in 
     about 6 months, and if there is any derangement in his profile, he 
     will be put on an antilipid drug.
 
4.   GI - at this point his GERD symptoms have not returned, and what I 
     will attempt to do is to keep him off his H2 blockers at this 
     point.  Should his symptoms return, the patient most likely will be 
     placed on Prilosec.
 
I will seen him in one month for follow-up, primarily for evaluation of 
his use of Hytrin.

HPI:  Kadeem Vicente comes in today for follow up office visit.  The patient 
is seen primarily for follow up regarding his history of hypertension, 
coronary artery disease (the patient is status post inferior wall MI), 
benign prostatic hypertrophy and to a much lesser extent osteoarthritis.  
The patient is also followed GERD-like symptoms.  With regard to the 
latter, the patient notes that since he has been off the Zantac, he 
initially saw no change in his ability to handle foods; however, he now 
notes that he is starting to get some reflux and feels slightly 
uncomfortable with this.  He denies chest pain per se and any symptoms 
pertinent to cardiovascular disease, such as chest heaviness, shortness 
of breath, diaphoresis, nausea.  The patient knows the foods that give 
him this type of reaction, such as tomato based sauces and tries to 
avoid them as much as possible.  The patient is asking me about Prilosec 
which he recently read in the Journal and was wandering whether this 
would be a suitable alternative to H2 blockers (Patient had been on H2 
blockers for many years without a trial off of them, which a reason that 
we stopped his H2 blocker therapy recently).  
 
With regard to the patient's symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, 
the patient says that these have almost completely resolved on the 4 mg 
of Hytrin and which he will continue taking.  The patient does remain on 
Zestril for his hypertension as well as the Hytrin and the blood 
pressure gotten by the nurse today was 150/80 and repeated by me 20 
minutes later was 130/74. 
 
The patient reports being otherwise well, no new symptoms.  No positive 
review of systems.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Was not performed.  Vitals:  Blood pressure taken by me 
was 130/74 in the right, 130/74 in the left, temperature was 98.8, 
respirations 20, unlabored and pulse was 80.  
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  75 year old man with multiple medical concerns 
comes in for follow up.
1.   Hypertension.  The patient will stay on his Zestril, once a day as 
     well as his Hytrin, which he uses also for BPH.  His blood pressure 
     appears to be well controlled on this regimen.  One of the issues 
     would be whether or not the patient should be on a beta-blocker.  
     The patient verbally has a history of ""a silent heart attack""  and 
     there is evidence of an inferior wall MI and this is certainly an 
     option we will consider in the future, although I would not add a 
     third anti-hypertensive regimen and would most likely replace his 
     Zestril with a beta-blocker.
2.   GERD.  The patient will be given a prescription for Prilosec 20 mg 
     to be taken at bedtime.  The patient was told that this would not

     be long term therapy but that we can do this for the next 2-3 
     months, although he should be able to experience relief almost 
     immediately.  The patient does have a known hiatal hernia, which 
     may also contribute to his symptoms of chronic reflux.
3.   BPH - The patient will stay on his 4 mg of Hytrin, which appears to 
     be working quite well.  The patient notes that there is less 
     dribbling, less nocturnal urination.  The patient does take Lasix 
     20 mg once a day for congestive heart failure and did not have any 
     difficulty with urination after he takes the diuretic.  
4.   Insomnia.  The patient will stay on his Ambien 10 mg which he takes 
     on a q.h.s. basis.  The patient was formerly on Amitriptyline but 
     was told that the secondary side effects which can include EKG 
     changes and at this point tells me that the Ambien works and he 
     would like to stay on this.  Patient has enough to last until I see 
     him next time.
 
I will thus see the patient in 3 months for a fasting lipid (The 
patient's lipid profile thus far has been acceptable.   The cholesterol 
is 190 and an acceptable triglyceride; however, I do want to assess the 
patient's LDL and HDL before making any decisions with regard to 
treatment.

HPI:  Mr. Vicente returns for follow-up.  He is status post TURP by Dr. 
Nixon.  He is having a little bit of incontinence, but Dr. Nixon 
thinks that this should get better.
 
We will have to recheck his platelets, which have been in the 120 to 145 
range.  We also will look back at his echocardiogram, which is showing 
that he had slight mitral and tricuspid regurgitation as well as mildly 
dilated LV with inferior hypokinesis.  He has remained on digoxin status 
post his myocardial infarction.
 
We want to recheck his cholesterol today.  We also have been concerned 
that he has been a little depressed but mostly because he is concerned 
about his wife's situation with breast cancer.  We had a long discussion 
about this.
 
Physical Examination:  On physical examination, his weight is 250 lbs.  
His blood pressure was 178/80.  The follow-up was 170/80.  His neck was 
supple.  Chest was clear to both percussion and auscultation.  Cardiac 
exam was regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdomen 
was soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities were 
clear of cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Rectal tone was normal and guaiac 
negative.
 
Laboratory Data:  His hematocrit was 39.9.  Platelets were within normal 
limits.  White count is 8.3.  Digoxin is 0.9.  Lytes are within normal 
limits.  
 
Assessment and Plan:
1.   Status post TURP.  He appears to be recovering well.  He has had 
     slight incontinence, but I suspect this will pass.
2.   Thrombocytopenia.  This was very relative.  It now appears to have 
     resolved.
3.   Coronary artery disease.  As he recovers from his TURP, I question 
     whether it might be reasonable to go ahead and reexercise him.  At 
     the present time, he is quite stable on an aspirin, digoxin and 
     Lasix.  However, it may be that he would benefit from further 
     treatment with anti-anginals.
4.   Hypercholesterolemia.  This has been well-controlled recently.  His 
     last cholesterol was 168 in August of 2093.
5.   Depression.  He continues on Ambien.  He has some discretion about 
     his wife's breast cancer, and he appears to have some of his 
     uncertainty resolved.

RE:  Vicente, Kadeem F.
     MRN: 948-59-58-0
 
Dear Miles:
 
I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Vicente in Cardiovascular Care today.  This lovely 77-year old man has had past medical
history notable for coronary artery disease, hypertension, benign
prostatic hypertrophy, depression, insomnia, osteoarthritis status
post total knee replacement.
 
He presents today because of a recent exacerbation of symptomatic
coronary artery disease.  His history of coronary artery disease
begins with his presentation following his total knee replacement
in June of 2091.  In 10/91 he had an episode of profound weakness
and sat down.  He had no clear substernal chest pressure, loss of
consciousness or edema.  Workup at that time included a thallium
test which did not clearly demonstrate ischemia and an
echocardiogram with an ejection fraction of 50%.  He began therapy
at that point in time with aspirin, niacin, vitamin E, Lasix,
Zestril, Zantac, Minipress, Amitriptyline, and Digoxin.  He had
been free of exertional neck, chest, arm and jaw pain, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, claudication and TIA
until this past spring.  He actually had done very well with risk
factor reduction including completing cardiac rehab at MJH and
following a stringent weight reduction program and decreasing his
weight.  In March of 2094 he began noticing that when he was going
up the 19 steps in his house he began having mid-sternal chest
discomfort and some dyspnea at the top of the stairs.  He stopped
working with the physiotherapist at that point and was initiated on
nitrate therapy.  Since that time he has noted that he has had
significant decrease in symptoms and over the past week has
actually had no need to take sublingual nitroglycerine and has been
taking the full flight of stairs without difficulty.  He does note
fatigue and insomnia such that he is sleeping only 2 to 3 hours a
night.  He does continue to be free of paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations or lightheadedness.
 
Medical regimen includes Ambien, Paxil, Isordil 20 t.i.d.,
Atenolol, Digoxin, Zantac and aspirin.  He has no known drug
allergies.
 
On physical exam blood pressure when he first arrived at Clinic was
noted to be 220/100.  At the present time it is 180/100 with a
Vicente, Kadeem F.

heart rate of 55 and a respiratory rate of 10.  There is no
increase in jugular venous pressure.  His carotids are free of
bruits.  His lungs are entirely clear to auscultation throughout,
and cardiac exam is notable for a non-displaced PMI, S1 and
physiologically-split S2 with no murmur, rub or gallop.  Abdominal
exam is notable for a ventral hernia.  There is no organomegaly and
neither are there bruits present.  Lower extremities are notable
for 2+ femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial
pulses with no edema.  Skin exam is notable only for the senile
angioma.
 
Electrocardiogram is notable for a left bundle branch block which
is new since prior tracing available here of 4/03/94.  MIBI was
notable only for a potential fixed anteroseptal defect and no
significant ischemia on 5/6/94.  The ejection fraction on a gated
spect was 57%.  
 
In summary, it appears that Mr. Vicente may have experienced a new
myocardial infarction resulting in a left bundle branch block in
March of 2094.  He could, however, also have developed his
progressive conduction system disease and have the fixed defect on
his MIBI attributable only to a left bundle branch block.  I will
be reviewing the primary images to make my final decision.  In
either regard he is now free of symptoms on his current medical
regimen despite his increased weight and his increased blood
pressure.  I certainly agree with further assistance from nutrition
and weight loss and proceeding with Imdur therapy which I would
increase to 60 mg p.o. q.d.  I also would consider further decrease
of his LDL with statin therapy but would only consider this after
assessing his response to re-initiation his nutrition program. 
Given his lack of symptoms at the present time with his usual daily
activity, I would prefer to proceed on the medical therapy route. 
I think that he could be reintroduced to rehab at MJH with the
hopes that further education can get him back on line in terms of
risk factor reduction.  
 
I certainly look forward to discussing this case further with you. 
It's certainly a pleasure to participate in his care.
 
Sincerely,

VICENTE,KADEEM FRANCIS   948-59-58-0              VISIT DATE: 09/30/95

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Chest discomfort. 

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 78-year-old gentleman 

who had a stuttering course of chest discomfort throughout the 

night, last night, and into today.  He finally took nitroglycerin 

tablets at about 9 or 10:00 a.m. and this abated his chest 

discomfort.  The patient has known history of coronary artery 

disease and recently had gone back on his coronary rehab program, 

however, yesterday after a workout, he became extremely tired, more 

tire than usual.  He thought he might have pushed it a bit and he 

rested throughout the rest of the day.  Then last night, he had 

some chest discomfort, which he initially did not think much of. 

Then was then associated with some shortness of breath in the early 

morning hours.  He felt he was wheezing.  This resolved after he 

got up and walked around.  He took the nitroglycerin tablets this 

morning.  These were fresh nitroglycerin tablets he had just 

obtained and this, in fact, resolved his symptoms.  He then came in 

to see Dr. Echeverria, his physician, in clinic and was sent to the 

emergency department for evaluation.  Please see the handwritten 

emergency department record for additional details. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease 

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  See handwritten emergency 

department record. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is presently comfortable, not 

tachypneic.  His blood pressure is 160/80.  His heart rate is in 

the 50s.  There is no evidence of congestive heart failure on 

examination.  There is no jugular venous distention and his lungs 

are clear to auscultation.  His heart examination is distant, with 

no murmurs or gallops appreciated.  His extremities have trace 

edema.  Abdomen in soft and non-tender.  Pulses are equal. 

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  His electrocardiogram shows a left bundle 

branch pattern with no change in configuration from previous 

tracings.  His other laboratory studies are pending. 

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The case was discussed with his 

physician, Dr. Echeverria.  We both agree that the patient has 

probably had a progression of his coronary syndrome with possible 

unstable plaque, given his episode of shortness of breath and 

paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  It is possible that he has silent 

ischemia, which is not evident because of the left bundle branch 

pattern.  Pending the other evaluation and studies, which are being 

sent at this time, the patient will require hospitalization for 

further medical management. 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Acute coronary insufficiency, coronary artery 

disease. 

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 

admitted to the hospital in stable condition.

VUONG,XOCHILT R   515-31-23-5                  VISIT DATE: 01/15/61
PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Bleeding. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 71 year old female status 
post cardiac cath stent placement and then later EP study states 
that she was doing well until last night when she started to ooze 
from the groin site.  She did not apply any pressure.  She states 
that she was bleeding through the night, did not want to bother her 
brother, called Dr. Aponte today who told her to come in.  She 
states that she did not know where the site was.  She could not see 
it and she did not apply pressure.  She has no chest pain, no 
shortness of breath.  She is not dizzy.  She is on Lovenox and 
Coumadin both.  She has not had her PT checked.  The rest of the 
systems were reviewed and are negative. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Depression, cardiac cath, hypothyroidism. 
MEDICATIONS:  Taken from the chart. 
ALLERGIES:  Taken from the chart. 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her brother. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her heart rate was 81, her temperature is 
96.5 degrees, blood pressure is 123/64.  This is a well-developed 
female, alert, oriented.  HEENT exam is atraumatic, normocephalic. 
Neck is soft and supple.  Mouth and throat are normal. 
Well-hydrated moist mucosa.  Conjunctiva are clear.  Sclerae are 
non-icteric.  There is no jugular venous distention.  Heart had a 
regular rate and rhythm.  The lungs were clear to auscultation 
bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender.  No guarding.  No 
hepatosplenomegaly.  There is a hematoma at the right groin.  The 
cath site was about 1 cm and closed but there was some small oozing 
from the site.  It stopped with pressure.  The patient was covered 
in blood and blood clots.  The old dressing was removed.  All the 
dried blood and blood clots were removed.  The patient was cleaned 
up by myself.  Then, the nurses put her in the hospital gown. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  PT, PTT, CBC were obtained. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  After speaking with the patient at 
length, it seems that she lives with her older brother.  She is 
caring for him and is a bit overwhelmed with this.  Obviously, her 
medical knowledge base is not adequately prepared to deal with this 
problem.  She will be admitted to the Observation Area through the 
day for nurse training.  Social Services will be consulted to 
arrange for a home visiting nurse.  Dr. Aponte was called. 
CONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  Social Services and Dr. Aponte. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Bleeding from cath site and knowledge deficit. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  See the chart 
for disposition.

Coronary artery disease	      

s/p right coronary stent 1/2061 after non-Q wave MI.  She had an arrest in the field on 9/05/2062 and was taken to SLH, after intubation in the field.  Emergency catheterization showed 30% LAD. 40% diagonal and a ejection fraction of 25% with antero-septal akinesis.  CPKs were neg.  Of note, a recent stress test at DCGH had shown LBBB but nl LV function, so she was diagnosed with new cardiomyopathy.  She was disch on 9/10 to Dr. Qu's care.  It is not clear that she has followed-up recently, though a echo from 09/24/62 shows an ejection fraction of 58% with no definite segmental wall motion abnormality.  She has been pain free and is able to walk a few blocks without difficulty since then.

3 mos f/u","Record date: 2064-07-17







Name:  Xochilt Vuong

MRN:  6398353





REASON FOR VISIT:  Xochilt Vuong is a 74-year-old patient of Dr. Wanda Yeomans, and is sent because of rising serum creatinine.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Vuong has a history of diabetes mellitus 

going back more than 10 years.  She also has had hypertension and elevated lipids 

over approximately the same period of time.  She has a complicated history 

including lung cancer and colon cancer, both treated and in remission.  Her 

creatinine has been rising gradually over recent years with a value of 1.0 in 2062, 

1.2 in May 2063, 2.1 and 1.8 in early 2064 with 2.3 in May 2064, and recently 3.1 

obtained on July 06, 2064.



She has been quite anemic in the recent months with a hematocrit level of 24.9.  

Her serum folate, B12, and iron and are not particularly low, and MCV is normal 

at 81.  Urinalysis showed 3+ albumin in September 2062 and persisting 

proteinuria since that time.  Dr. Yeomans obtained an ultrasound examination in 

March, which showed diffusely thinned renal cortices, but no evidence of 

obstruction, stones, or masses.



She has visited an ophthalmologist regularly for macular degeneration.  She does 

not know whether signs of diabetes are present, but she has had no laser treatment 

for any proliferative retinopathy.



Recently, she has been feeling unusually fatigued with diminished appetite and 

almost constant nausea.  She vomits rarely.  Her weight has fallen by about 20 

pounds.  She is slightly constipated.  She is moderately dyspneic on exertion.  She 

is not troubled by muscle cramps or by unusual itching of her skin.



Her medications continue as listed with ACE inhibitors, ""statins,"" and a rather 

large dose of Lasix at 80 mg twice a day.

Lopressor (METOPROLOL Tartrate) 50MG, 0.5 Tablet(s) PO BID

Fe Gluconate (FERROUS Gluconate) 325MG, 1 Tablet(s) PO TID

Prilosec (OMEPRAZOLE) 20MG, 1 Capsule(s) PO BID

Lipitor 40 MG PO 1 TAB QD 





PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, she looks tired but 

reasonably comfortable.  She speaks in a high-pitched somewhat hoarse voice, 

which has persisted since one of her surgical procedures.  Her blood pressure in 

the right arm, sitting, is 148/60 with regular pulse 72.  Her chest has a few basal 

crackles but in general is clear and air moves comfortably.  JVP fills below the 

sternal angle heart shows a grade 2 systolic murmur, loudest at the upper left 

sternal border.  Abdomen is soft and nontender.  There is no renal tenderness.  

Extremities have no edema.



IMPRESSION:  Progressive renal failure in a 74-year-old woman with more than 

10 years' history of diabetes as well has hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  The 

proteinuria, if confirmed, would support the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy but 

this would be unusual in the absence of retinopathy.  It would be useful to know 

from her ophthalmologist whether retinopathy is present.  It is, of course, also 

possible that she has vascular disease involving the kidneys.  Their symmetry and 

the presence of proteinuria would argue against this possibility.  The ACE 

inhibitor in the presence of vascular disease might of course raise her serum 

creatinine by reducing renal blood flow somewhat.  Her loss of appetite and 

nausea may well be related to the degree of renal failure.



RECOMMENDATION:  I would suggest that she see Filomena Xia, RD, a renal 

dietitian, to learn a diet appropriate for renal failure as well as for her diabetes and 

hyperlipidemia.  This might succeed in reducing some of her nausea.  It think it 

would be worthwhile as an experiment to reduce or discontinue her Accupril and 

perhaps  her Lasix temporarily to see whether serum creatinine falls with 

less ACE inhibition and somewhat more fluid volume.  If, of course, shortness of 

breath worsens or edema appears, then returning to the Lasix would be 

reasonable.  It might be that a longer acting, milder diuretic, such as 5 mg of 

metolazone might help to control edema (and potassium) and reduce the 

requirement for Lasix.  If serum creatinine fell appreciably with less ACE and 

diuresis, it would reassure us that the damage was not all structural, and it might 

be then possible to return to these medicines with less worry.



Her anemia is no doubt related to lack of erythropoietin and would likely benefit 

from instituting therapy with Epogen (such as 4000 units twice a week) or 

Aranesp).



PLAN:  We will send a urine today for total protein to creatinine ratio, which may 

help us decide whether the problem is mainly diabetic nephropathy.  If so, the 

measures proposed would be appropriate.  We discussed the eventual probable 

need for dialysis (assuming no other intercurrent medical catastrophes).  It would 

be useful for her to visit the DCGH Renal Department (located here on our 

floor at 592G, along with Ms. Xia's office) to learn about modes of dialysis.  

We discussed construction of a forearm fistula, which should be done well before 

a need for it arises.  I would, in fact, recommend that she proceed to have this 

done in the next few months.  This could be arranged through Dr. Xaysana's office 

or perhaps by speaking with Dr. Najee Yuan.  I will, of course, help with any of 

these measures as necessary.









Xander Xie, M.D.





Wanda

Urine total protein/creatinine ratio is only 0.11 (corresponding to about 0.1 g/day or proteinuria).  This is a very small amount for diabetic nephropathy, and argues in favor of vascular disease.  I would suggest getting a MRA of renal arteries to look for any main artery obstruction.  If present it would account for the sensitivity of her creatinine to ACE or changes in hydration.

Diagnosis:  

1. Colon cancer

2. Lung Cancer



Reason for Visit: 

routine f/u



Main Symptoms/Side Effect of Treatment:   

 weight loss has stabilized

having more reflux

recently found to have worsening renal function and was seen by Dr Xie and felt to need dialysis in the near future. The cause of the RI is unclear but probably related to either diabetic or hypertensive disease.

  	  	

Past Oncologic History:  

1. T3 N3 adenocarcinoma of the left upper lobe diagnosed in 3/59 and s/p chemoradiation followed by resection

2. T2 N1 adenocarcioma of the sigmoid colon s/p adjuvant 5FU/LV completing therapy in 09/61

  

Social History: 

;nothing new to report



Review of Systems:  



All other systems are negative.

  



Physical Exam: deferred



Laboratory Data: CEA and CA19-9 normal



Chest abd pelvic CT without contrast: no evidence of metastatic disease



PET scan:  No definite evidence of metastatic disease



Impression:  

1. Stage 3 colon cancer:

2. Stage 2 lung cancer

3. Anemia

4. Renal Insufficiency



She has no evidence of metastatic disease and her main problem is her impending renal failure. We had a very blunt discussion about dialysis and her desire to not go on it. She understands that she would die from progressive renal dysfunction and she will talk more about this with Drs Yeomans and Xie.



Plan: 

1. as above



Counseling comprised the majority of today's visit which was 15 minutes

MR# 6691247

Date of Admission: 8/24/91

GI:  Narvaez, Guy

PCP: Suzanne, Otto



ID/CC:	Weakness 



HPI:  Mr. Wood is a 58 yo M w/ Hx of colonic polyps and diverticulosis who presents with 1 day of weakness.  Mr. Wood was at work this morning and at 9 AM he started to feel weak.  He describes the weakness as lack of energy and has normal muscle strength.  He states he really didn't have any symptoms other than weakness, but when asked about chest pain, he notes that he had mild chest discomfort, which was analogous to catching his breath after exercise.  He also describes some mild lightheadedness.  He has 2 pillow orthopnea, but he denies any fever, chills, nausea, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, syncope, HA, dyspnea, chest pain, PND, diaphoresis, palpitations, or any other concerning symptoms.  He notes his last BM was on Friday morning and states his stools have not been black or tarry, bright red, pencil thin, or watery.  He denies any abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea.  He notes that rest and staying out of the heat improved his symptoms, while exertion worsened his symptoms.  He has had these symptoms before in March of this year, but his symptoms today are more mild than when he presented then.  At that time he had symptoms of weakness and lightheadedness especially when standing, and he was found to have a Hct of 24.9.  He was guiac positive and was sent for a colonoscopy and an upper GI endoscopy, where a he was found to have erosive esophagitis and two cecal polyps.  The bowel prep on the colonoscopy was poor and he was asked to follow up with a repeat colonoscopy.  He was sent home on iron supplements and a PPI.  Of note, his previous colonoscopies had shown tubulovillous adenomas including a 25 mm polyp that could not be fully resected and had been   Before this admission he was seen by his worksite nurse who sent him to his PCP.  Dr. David Napolitano at Kessel Group Home saw him and transferred him to SMI for workup of severe anemia (Hct 25.4 MCV 75), dizziness, and orthostasis.

ER Course:  In the ER, he was started on IVFs and labs were sent.



Impression:  



Mr. Wood is a 58 yo M w/ Hx of colonic polyps and diverticulosis who presents with 1 day of weakness and lightheadedness secondary to a microcytic anemia.  His Hct stabilized at 26 since his transfer from his PCP's office.  His anemia is most likely due to lower GI bleeding from either his diverticulosis or from his polyposis given his guiac positive stool in the ER.  He is currently hemodynamically stable and he states he feels much better symptomatically.  Given that he hasn't had a follow up colonoscopy since the poorly prepped one in March of this year, he will probably need to be reevaluated by Dr. Narvaez.  Other possible attributing causes of his anemia could be hypothyroidism given his somewhat delayed response, but his DTR were normal.  Iron studies will be sent to confirm the probable diagnosis of chronic GI bleeding resulting in iron deficiency anemia.  He will not be transfused now given that he is asymptomatic currently and he prefers not to be transfused unless necessary.  His syncope could also have been exacerbated from his slight orthostatic hypotension as seen on PE and his high Cre and BUN indicating that he is volume depleted.  He will be adequately hydrated to correct his hypotension.  Given his chest pain and syncope, MI will be ruled out, but this is very unlikely given his clinical presentation.  His first enzymes were negative and his EKG showed no Q waves or ST changes.   



Plan: 

1)	GI Bleed

a.	Transfuse pRBCs if necessary - Consent and Type and Cross (O +)

b.	Two large bore IVs if rapid resuscitation is needed

c.	Follow Hct Q8H and watch HR and BP for signs of active bleeding

d.	Nexium 40 POQD

2)	Heme:  Anemia

a.	Send Iron Studies, TSH

b.	FeSO4 325 mg POTID

3)	CV:  

a.	Rule out MI:  Enzymes + Monitor

b.	Hypertensive:  Continue on HCTZ and Zestril

c.	Hyperlipidemia:  Continue Lipitor

Pt. notes a 5lbs weight gain over the past week. He also reports a 1-2 week h/o increasing DOE when he performs his household chores or working in his backyard. At his baseline, can can walk    of a mile w/o dyspnea or CP. 4 days PTA, he had to    take it easy    during a picnic as he would easily develop DOE with minimal exertion.  2days PTA, pt. experienced coughing bouts when he tried to lie down for sleep. The patient acutely developed SOB after lying down for a few minutes during his CT. He felt 1/10 CP during this episode located in the R middle sub-sternum. The pain lasted for approximately 10 min, dull in quality, did not radiate, did not change with position, relieved after given NTG in the ED. He experienced a similar CP during an administration of his chemo several months PTA. This CP was determined not be be cardiogenic. + diaphoresis, - N/V, - lightheadedness, - palpitations.

CXR:	

New mild interstitial pulmonary edema.



EKG:	Nl sinus rhythm, L axis deviation, nl intervals, T wave inversions I, aVL, T wave flattening V3-V6, old inferior infarct.



Echo 11/07 - There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.  There are no obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities.  Theestimated ejection fraction is 73 %.



___________________________________________



Impression: Pt. is a 59 y.o. male with DLBCL dx'ed 11/07 s/p CHOP-R, HTN, hyperlipidemia, GERD, and anemia who p/w acute onset SOB in the setting of a BP = 178/108 likely 2/2 flash pulmonary edema.





Plan: 

CHF - pt.'s PE resolved s/p 20 mg IV lasix, administration of lopressor, and NTG. He showed no signs of volume overload during the physical exam. Chest CT showed no acute hemorrhage, PTX, or lymphangitic spread (preliminary read). Follow-up official CT read. No contrast was given, therefore, acute SOB could not be secondary to contrast allergy. This pt.'s salty diet and uncontrolled HTN most likely led to the acute decompensation. No evidence of infection. Pt. will receive an Echo to evaluate for possible worsening LVEF s/p antrhacycline chemo vs. diastolic dysfunction with LV hypertrophy. F/U BNP. Will re-dose lasix only if necessitated by clinical signs of volume overload.

Angina - This pt. has EKG changes and pain that is possibly cardiogenic in origin. Will obtain serial enzymes to r/o MI. Begin ASA, increase lopressor to 50 TID, captopril instead of lisinopril for easier titration of BPs, 2LO2 via nasal canula. Consider stress test before d/c.

Prophylaxis - fragmin 5000 SC QD. SOB resolved after lasix + lopressor. Unlikely PE in this setting but pt. is hypercoagulable given malignancy. Low threshold for CT PE protocol.

GERD-Omeprazole.

Onc - Will check uric acid and LDH to eval. for possible TLS. Unlikely given normal electrolytes and good renal function. CT shows no lymphangitic spread but must f/u official read in the AM.

Office Note   Bobbie Albert #7000963		     Tuesday, October 01, 2074





Reason for visit

Mr. Albert is a 39-year-old American man status post bilateral lung transplantation due to cystic fibrosis and a history of HCV. He now presents with rising creatinine over the past three months and is referred by Dr. Benjamin Earnest.



Previous History and HPI

1)	CKD     Normal renal function until transplantation in 8/03/73, Crea 0.9 (weight 280lb). ARF during transplant admission, peak Crea 2.9. Post-tx Creatinine 1.8    2.0. Slow rise to 2.5 in 6/74, then episode of low blood pressure and fatigue. Cellcept and Norvasc were stopped. Crea rise from 1.8 to 3.3, yesterday 3.0. No foamy urine noted. Since 12/73 receives Parmidronate IV q3months. Estimated creatinine clearance 50-65ml/min.

2)	Cystic fibrosis     h/o multiple pneumonia, also aspergillus pneumonia. During admission for transplantation  7/73 MRSA sinusitis. 10/73 pneumomedistinum.

3)	h/o HCV postive 60-68, since then negative x2

4)	Hypertension.

5)	Hypercholesterolemia

6)	Gout for several years, several attacks, responding to Colchizine

7)	Obstructive sleep apnea, on Bipap

8)	Obesity, 340 lb peak post transplant, now 326 lb

9)	AVN right knee and hip



Allergies

NKDA



Medications

Neoral 150/175 bid, Prednison 15 qod, Bactrim SS tiw, Acyclovir 200 bid, Lipitor 40, Atenolol 50, MgGluconate 500 tid, Ca 600 bid, Vit D 50,000, Reglan 10 tid. Pamidronate IV q3months



Social-, Work-, and Family- History

Married with other lung transplant recipient (tx 9 years ago). No family history of renal disease. Nonsmoker, Marketing Manager.



ROS:

Good appetite, no skin itching. Drinks little according to wife. Poor energy level. Heart, lung, GI system without abnormal finding. No renal stones, no recurrent UTIs, urine amount unchanged. Occasional cramping while walking. Exercises in fitness studio.



Physical Exam

BP     R 150/105  L  145/100		HR    	64	weight 327 lbs. 

FS limited due to cataract. Moon facies, short neck.

OC     moist tongue. JVP ~ 8 cm.

No bruit neck/abdomen. distant heart sounds. Lungs clear.

Abdomen soft, spleen not palpated, liver ~12cm. Trace edema.

Appeared oriented, appropriate concerns. Speaks slowly.



Laboratory Values

9/30/74	Na 142, K 3.8,  Cl 106, Co2 24, BUN 35, Crea 3.0, Glu 85. 

Alb/tProt 3.5/7.5, Ca 8.9, Phos 3.5, Mg 1.1. AP 175.

 	WBC 7.2, Hgb 10.8, PLT 217

 	CyA 236, TGL 323, Chol 175, LDL 81, HDL 29.			



Today	UA     1.015/5.0/1+P. 

	Sed     one cast with dense pigmented inclusion (?cells),otherwise bland.



Impression and Plan

Mr Albert has progressive renal insufficiency, he does currently not require renal replacement therapy. Contributors may be Cyclosporine toxicity and intermittent dehydration. However, the recent more rapid rise makes biphosphonate toxicity or HCV-associated renal disease a worthy consideration. Bobbie also has uncontrolled hypertension and anemia.



I took the liberty to order a 24-hour urine collection, a kidney US, as well as SPEP, UPEP, cryoglobulin level, Fe-studies. Norvasc 5mg PO qd was also returned to his regiment. For now, I suggest to hold further infusions of Parmidronate until more data is available.



Bobbie will have a blood pressure check in 2 weeks (when he is in Nappanee for another appointment), and I will see him in four weeks. At that point he will be evaluated for Epogen/Aranesp.

TRANSPLANT FELLOW ADMIT NOTE





HPI: 42 year old man s/p bilateral lung transplantation for bronchiectasis in 7/73 transferred from Burlington Obstetrics Gynecology Center for further evaluation of N/V/D, fever and hypoxia.  Over the past six weeks he had reported a slow decline in respiratory function  prompting a recent admission here 1/23 -25/77 for elective bronchoscopy to rule out rejection.  He noted a slight spontaneous improvement a few days before that admission.  Bronchoscopy showed no rejection but washings did grow M. catarrhalis -levaquin was begun on 1/25/77.  Pt reports continued slow improvement in dyspnea following discharge.  Yesterday morning he developed watery diarrhea (no blood or mucus) soon followed by nausea and vomiting (no blood or coffee grounds).  He went to BOGC and describes feeling increased dyspnea.  Found to be febrile to 101F and hypoxic (SpO2 94%, PaO2 53) and started on supplemental oxygen.  GI symptoms have since improved and pt is tolerating PO.  Denies chest pain, palpitations, cough, rash, HA, rhinorrhea, sore throat at any point during this illness.  Currently no dyspnea at rest.

WBC 3.4, Hct 39, Plt 115



Micro: 

Nasal swab 1/31/77 - negative viral panel

Lung washings 1/23/77 - moderate M. catarrhalis



Path: Transbrochial biopsy 1/23 - negative for tissue rejection



CXR 1/31: Unremarkable 



Impression: 

42 year old man s/p bilateral lung transplant 7/73 for bronchiectasis developed acute GI illness in setting of levaquin tx for recent respiratory infection.  Now afebrile and with resolution of GI symptoms.  Remains somewhat dyspneic with normal BP and HR.  Azotemia possibly attributable to dehydration though concern for other etiologies as per Dr. Reilly's note.  WBCs reduced from recent levels.



Recommendations: 

GI illness: Mostly asymptomatic now though some concerning abnormalities remain (O2 requirement, low plt, low WBC, high Cr).  Remains hemodynamically stable.  Await results of panculture including stool studies (including C diff, E coli, Camphylobacter) when available.  

Transplant: Continue current immunosuppression and prophylactic abx.  Will consider holding cellcept, valcyte if leukopenia persists/worsens.  Follow daily cyclosporin troughs.  No evidence of rejection on recent biopsy.

Dyspnea: Consider aspiration though CXR negative, will follow.  Hold abx for now.

Renal: Azotemia of unclear etiology, follow up labs pending.  Renal consult per Dr. Reilly.

MEDICINE TEAM 4 ADMIT NOTE
Name: Albert, Bobbie
MRN: 7000963
Date of Admission: 5/14/79
Attending: Dr. Benjamin Earnest

CC/ID: pneumonia

HPI: 
44M s/p double lung transplant in 2073 for bronchiectasis (on 2L home O2), HTN, and CKD, who is directly admitted to team 4 for PNA.  Pt. was in USOH until about 3 weeks ago when he first noted a sore throat.  He had a sick contact at work.  Pt. saw his PCP, who prescribed 10 days of Levaquin.  Although the sore throat resolved after about one week, pt. developed a cough producing yellowish sputum and chest congestion.  Pt. called his pulmonologist   s office (Dr. Earnest) and was advised to have a sputum sample sent to a lab in Florida, where pt. lives.  He was also advised to complete his Levaquin course, which ended on 5/10.  Despite completing levaquin course, cough, congestion, and mild DOE (occasionally had to increase home O2 from 2L to 3L) persisted.  He noted a temperature to 100 on 5/8, no chills, no chest pain.  Pt. again called Dr. Earnest, who ordered chest CT, PFTs, and obtain sputum culture results from lab in Florida, which revealed a pathogen resistant to cipro (did not test susceptibility to levoflox) and susceptible to zosyn and cefepime.  Pt. is admitted for IV antibiotics.

Source of Hx:   Patient and chart, pulmonary fellow evaluation


ID/CC: presumed lung rejection s/p lung transplant


HPI: 
Mr. Albert is a 44-year-old man with bronchiectasis who underwent bilateral lung transplantation in July 2073. He was seen in the post-transplant clinic on 10/29/2079 with complaints of worsening dyspnea on exertion over the preceding two weeks to the point that he has been symptomatic with ADLs and after walking 4-5 steps. He says that his prednisone dose was decreased from 12.5 to 10 mg daily approximately 1 month ago and that his tacrolimus dose had been decreased earlier this year. At baseline, he is on supplemental oxygen (2L NC at rest and 4L NC with exertion). He denied F/C/cough/chest pain/jaw or L arm pain/sick contacts. Recently had a treadmill ETT and TTE in Florida. Also some morning headaches for the past 5 days. Denies vision change, sinus pain or drainage. No recent leg pain/swelling or prolonged travel. No recent travel outside of Fountain Of The Four Rivers area. Has a puppy at home; no other recent animal contact. No recent falls. His PFTs demonstrated a worsening FEV1 and CT scan demonstrates evidence of worsening obstruction, likely related to rejection. He is being admitted for treatment of acute on chronic rejection.

CC: dyspnea, hypoxia 



HPI: 

47 yo man with long-standing bronchiectasis requiring double lung transplant in 2073 who states that for approximately the last month he has felt occasionally dyspneic and &#8220;dizzy&#8221; (which he more specifically describes as a sensation of unsteadiness, not vertigo-like), along with several discrete episodes of nausea with vomiting (maybe three days in the last month, the last time yesterday). 
He was visiting friends/family near The Woodlands, when on 8/20 he awoke feeling acutely dyspneic and weak.



He presented to Marion Memorial Hospital, where he was noted to be saturating in the high 90s on 2L, which is his baseline (4L with activity). Other notable labs were a Cr of 2.3, BNP 84, INR subtherapeutic at 1.4. CXR was read as no acute processHe was thought to be wheezy, and was given 10 mg of dexamethasone IV, nebulizers. He was empirically started on a heparin drip (800 unit bolus, 1800 units/hr) given his h/o DVT and a subtherapeutic INR. He was then transferred to MARY. 



In the ED here his INR was 2.4 (and his PTT was over 150). Upon interview here, he endorses the above history. Vitals upon arrival to the ED 97.3 79 141/95 24 100%2L.



He also notes that his INR had been stable recently (followed by his PCP) on his current dose of 4 Coumadin daily (except 2 on Mon/Fri). 



He denies cough, chest pain, GI symptoms, URI symptoms



15-point ROS negative except as in HPI with following additions: none.

SUBJECTIVE: The patient returns.  She has had three
operations on her back, finally ending with a fusion of
L2-L3 and a laminectomy in that area for recurrent disk
disease  at L2-L3.  She still is having severe pain going
down her right leg and anterior knee which is unchanged or
perhaps somewhat better.  She sees Dr. Herring with
regularity.  She has seen Dr. Oscar Riggs.  She has
nothing wrong with her hips and she has had multiple CT
scans showing the numerous operations and fusion.  

MEDICATIONS:  
1.  Lipitor 20 mg q.d. 
2.  Glynase 1.5 mg b.i.d. 
3.  Trandate 100 mg q.d.  
4.  Tegretol 300 mg in a.m., 200 mg in the p.m.  
5.  Premarin 0.625 mg 30 days a month.  
6.  Provera 5 mg 12 days a month.
7.  Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg q.d. 
8.  Calcium 1200 mg q.d. 

She is in physiotherapy presently. She is not smoking nor
drinking.  She has been eating and has gained considerable
weight.

She has no cardiopulmonary, GI or GU complaints.  She is to
see Dr. Bruce Godfrey's replacement in August and to get a
mammogram at that time.  Hopefully, she will be able to lie
on the table when that occurs.  She is now able to drive a
car, but walks with a cane and cannot lie down with any
degree of ease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She weighs 192 lbs stripped and her
blood pressure is 160/90 in the left arm standing, pulse is
72 and regular.  She appears as a well developed, overweight
white female in pain, having to hold on while standing,
easily weeping, but pleasant.  There is no icterus, cyanosis
or edema.  The eyes reveal 2+ arcus.  Pupils are round,
reactive and equal.  Nose and throat examination is
unremarkable.  Neck veins are flat.  Carotids are 2+ and
equal and without bruit.  Thyroid small and smooth.  Lungs
are clear to P&A. The heart is not enlarged.  There is a
regular sinus rhythm and no significant murmurs.  S1 and S2
are normal.  Liver and spleen cannot be felt.  She has good
peripheral pulses.

IMPRESSION:  
1.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.  She has had an eye exam at
Mitchel Memorial Hospital this past year, but her diabetes is poorly
controlled as her blood sugars have been in the 150-200
range.  I have told her to increase her Glynase to 3 mg
twice a day until she is able to diet.
2.  L2-L3 disk with fusion. 
3.  Mild hypertension, on no medication.  Will not start any
until she loses weight.

(584) 728-8734

SUBJECTIVE:  The patient returns having been in Maine for
the winter in the past five months.  Her husband visited
ever three weeks or so.  She is walking somewhat better with
less pain but moves very slowly.  She says that for the past
two weeks she first had some substernal pressure which moved
down into her abdomen and now instead of having one bowel
movement every one or two weeks she is having a bowel
movement three times a week which is formed and not bloody. 
 She put herself on Pepto-Bismol and is gradually getting
better.

She has not had any chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations,
cough or hemoptysis.  She has no visual signs.  She has not
been seen by the ophthalmologist recently.  Her hearing is
good.  She has mammograms yearly.  She sees her gynecologist
on a yearly basis, Dr. Giles, having changed from Dr. Godfrey.
 She is not sexually active.  

She is not dieting and has not lost any weight.  Her back
pain is somewhat better.  

MEDICATIONS:  She is on the following medications:  
1.  Lipitor 20 mg q.d. 
2.  Glynase 1.5 mg b.i.d. 
3.  Avandia 4 mg q.a.m. 
4.  Trandate 100 mg q.d. 
5.  Tegretol 300 mg in the a.m. and 200 the evening (changed
to 200 mg b.i.d.).  
6.  Neurontin 200 mg b.i.d. 
7.  Premarin 0.625 mg 30 days a month.  
8.  Provera 5 mg 12 days a month.  
9.  Enteric coated aspirin 81 mg q.d.
10. Calcium 1200 mg q.d. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Her diabetes has been poorly regulated
and hopefully the Avandia will make her feel better.  She
states that she takes the Avandia in the morning and she
feels very weak at lunchtime such that she has to get an
orange juice.  She says that her blood sugar has dropped but
when she checks it, it has been around 100 mg%  and I
explained to her that it is a normal blood sugar but it may
be that the drop causes her to have symptoms.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She weighs 192 lbs stripped which is a
weight gain for her.  Her blood pressure is 122/76 in the
right arm sitting with a wide cuff.  She appears as a well
developed, pleasant white female, grossly overweight, moving
slowly and can only get up on the examining table with help
because of her back pain.  There is no icterus, cyanosis or
edema.  The pupils are round, reactive and equal and react
equally to light and accommodation.  Nose and throat
examination is unremarkable.  Neck veins are flat.  Carotids
are 2+ and equal and without bruit.  Lungs are clear to P&A.
 Breasts reveal no masses or discharge.  The heart is not
enlarged.  There is a regular sinus rhythm and no
significant murmurs.  S1 and S2 are of normal intensity. 
Liver and spleen are not felt.  Bowel sounds are normal. 
There are no abdominal masses or tenderness.  This is a
female escutcheon.  Rectal was deferred.  She has fair
peripheral pulses and decreased vibration sense in her feet.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Diabetes mellitus, poorly regulated.  Will check
glycohemoglobin today.  
2.  Diabetic neuropathy.  
3.  L2-L3 disk with fusion.  
4.  Hypercholesterolemia on Lipitor.
5.  Weight management problem.

SUBJECTIVE:  The patient comes in stating that she has had 5
days of substernal pain like a ""ball pressing in on her
chest.""  She has also had abdominal pain and has felt quite
poorly.  She did call this service this past weekend she
states and never received a call back.  She called me this
morning, and I saw her immediately.  The pain has not gone
down her arms and it is mostly located in her chest.  She
feels occasionally like she is going to throw up, and she
says that her blood sugars have been quite high.  She does
have diabetes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her lungs are clear to P&A.  Her
blood pressure is 130/80 in the right arm sitting with a
pulse of 64.  Her neck veins are flat, carotids 2+ and equal
without bruit.  Heart is not enlarged.  There is a regular
sinus rhythm, and no significant murmurs.  Liver and spleen
are not felt.  EKG taken shows a possible old anterior
myocardial infarction, which is a distinct change from her
last EKG with poor progression of the R waves across the
precordium.

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Question myocardial infarction. 
Because of her prolonged pain and changes in the EKG, I
think that she should be observed in the BH emergency
ward and attend her there.

The patient returns not having been seen since last September by
me and at which time she had some chest pain which did not turn
out to be anything significant.  She is followed up by Dr. Horne
who felt that she had a lot of anxiety and she was at that time
on lisinopril as well as her other diabetic medications.  She
comes back from Maine.  She is on the following medications:
1.  Lipitor 20 mg q.d.
2.  Glynase 1.5 mg b.i.d.
3.  Glucophage 500 mg b.i.d.
4.  Cozaar 50 mg b.i.d.
5.  Avandia 4 mg q.a.m.
6.  Trandate 100 mg q.d.
7.  Tegretol 300 mg in the a.m. 150 mg in the p.m.
8.  Neurontin 200 mg b.i.d. (she was told she could discontinue
this)
9.  Premarin and Provera discontinued.
10.  Aspirin 81 mg q.d.
12.  Calcium 1200 mg q.d.

She states today that her abdomen has been distended for the past
5 days.  She has not had a bowel movement in 10 days.  She
ordinarily has a bowel movement once every 2 weeks.  She takes
nothing to move her bowels and she is extraordinarily upset about
her daughter who is homeless.  She has provided for her daughter,
helped her get a job, and the daughter is emotionally ill, and I
have advised the patient that she should be in a mental
institution.  The patient no longer care for her daughter and her
daughter cares nothing about her father and mother.  It is a
hopeless situation and 45 minutes were spent in discussion of the
daughter's illness and what the patient would do about this.  I
have told her to use some Dulcolax suppositories and Dulcolax by
mouth for probable impacted feces, although this is not an
uncommon thing for her and I have ordered a set of blood tests to
check on her diabetes, kidney function, etc.  She has a good
physician in Maine where she is planning to move in June and
she will return to me next week for a complete physical.  She
does have diabetic neuropathy mild and diabetic nephropathy mild.
 Her back has healed.  She no longer uses a cane to walk except
on climbing stairs.  She no longer has any chest pain or
shortness of breath.  She is extraordinarily anxious and
hopefully she will listen to the advice that I gave her.  Total
time spent during this visit was 45 minutes.

RE: LINDSAY, Anastasha 
SDP#: 5563788 
 
Dear Dr. Ho:  
 
I had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Lindsay today in follow up at the Saint Davids Pavilion Neurology. I last saw her on 07/27/2112. She is a 72-year-old woman who is status post a right MCA distribution cortical infarct in April of 2112 with residual left hand weakness. Since I last saw her Mrs. Lindsay has not done very well. She has had multiple recent falls and her gait has become even more unsteady. She tends to veer to either side and does have a frequent feeling of lightheadedness. She has hit her head on a couple of occasions with these falls. 

  
Of note her blood pressure medication has been essentially doubled since I last saw her. She is now taking 10 mg of Zestril every day instead of five and taking Atenolol 50 mg q.d. instead of 25 mg p.o. q.d. She does have intermittent weakness of the left hand which is likely recrudescent of her prior stroke symptoms and not new strokes. She does not have discoordination, vertigo or diplopia. She does have intermittent chest pains as well which she loath to bring to the attention of her physician.  She is reluctant to use a cane because her family states that ""her husband does not use a cane and he is older, why should she have to use a cane"". She has been switched to Plavix 75 mg p.o.  q.d. from aspirin. This was done without my knowledge as well.  She continues to have difficulty ""feeling my feet"" and this has been a chronic problem for her as well.  
 
On examination she is alert. She is a garrulous and tangential historian and needs to be frequently refocussed. Her speech is fluent in English. English is her second language and she is less fluent in that language. Her visual fields are full to confrontation. Her extraocular movements are full with no nystagmus. Her face is symmetric other than a mild left nasolabial fold flattening. She has a mild left pronator drift and slowed finger tapping on the left side. She has no ataxia on finger-to-nose-to-finger testing. Her gait is slightly wide-based and unsteady. She can veer to either side and frequently has to hold on to someone next to her for stability.  
 
IMPRESSION: I do not feel that Mrs. Lindsay has had a new embolic event, however I am quite concerned about her continued falling and difficulty with both her continued peripheral neuropathy and likely hypoperfusion. This appears to be pressure dependent and I would suggest that we back off on her antihypertensive medications at this time. In looking at her recent CBCs she has also been consistently anemic and with her complaints of chronic fatigue I think this could certainly be a factor. Atenolol could certainly be a factor in this as well and perhaps a different antihypertensive medication could be considered or it could be discontinued altogether. Furthermore with her recurrent chest pains she should seek an opinion from her primary care physician regarding this and I have counseled her to do so.  
 
I will see Mrs. Lindsay in follow up in 6 months time but I am available to discuss her care at any time in the interim.   
Sincerely,

Educare-Fargo A MSIII Admission Note

Pt: Lindsay, Anastasha	

MR#: 	 5563788

Date of Admission: 10/07/15

Attending: 	



Source: Pt, Pt's daughter and husband, chart.



CC:  Dizziness, unsteady gait, difficulty speaking per family



HPI:  74 yo F with pmh of DM, CRI, Breast Ca, CVA, who is s/p cataract surgery on 09/25/15 presents with two days of unsteady gait, weakness, mild dysarthria and hallucinations.



She has a baseline amount of increasing forgetfulness, decreased appetite, and increased somnolence over the past 2 years.  She frequently forgets whether or not she has taken her medications.  She rarely leaves her home as her walking is limited by joint pain and shortness of breath.  She moves around the house infrequently and when she does it is usually from the bed to the couch per her daughter.  She has had several falls in the recent years.  She does not cook and is overall much less active than her husband who lives with her.  At her baseline, her family is concerned that she has been developing Alzheimer's Disease.  



Twelve days ago, she underwent cataract surgery on her R eye and was in her usual state of health for several days thereafter.  However, two days ago, she started to hallucinate mentioning she was seeing flies, birds and spots.  Her family noted that she had difficulty forming words and also spoke incoherently at times.  She also complained of dizziness, had an increasingly unsteady gait, and did not want to eat both expressing no interest in food and saying she was worried about not being able to swallow.  She has also been falling asleep very rapidly recently, so much so that she has fallen asleep on her plate at the breakfast table.  However, she has also woken up frequently at night, often talking incoherently and once even getting up and attempting to cook breakfast at 3am.  Her family also mentions that her face had recently become swollen. Her family reports that her symptoms were worsened after she took her Diamox, and thus they stopped giving it to her.  



She was brought to the ED on 10/06/15 as her family was concerned that she had another CVA.  Her VS on admission were BP 120/41, HR 54, RR 18, T 96.4, O2 sat 96% on RA.  She had a negative CT, MRI, CXR and labs were drawn.  In the ED she reportedly had an episode of choking while eating a pancake. Currently, she reports that she is seeing many small black dots, is tired and has no dizziness, HA or pain.



ROS:  Notable on ROS is progressive dysphagia over the last year that she reports has gotten much worse of late.  She also reports occasional transient stabbing pain in the center of her sternum that often accompanies intense emotions and is not made worse by activity.   She has occasional palpitations.

She reports no recent fever, wt loss, cough, hemoptosis, orthopnea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, sick contacts.  She reports some urinary incontinence.



PMH: 

Breast Ca- Diagnosed in 10/2111, she is s/p R lumpectomy and XRT for her tumor that was HER-2/neu 2+.  She is followed by Dr. Ursula Marshall at SDP.  

DM- Controlled by insulin.  Her most recent HbA1c was 6.0 in June 2115.

CVA- 3 yrs ago, had abrupt onset of L hemiparesis that resoloved within 48 hrs. Has PFO.

Rest ECG:

 The baseline cardiac rhythm was normal sinus rhythm. The rest electrocardiogram revealed poor R-wave progression and  nonspecific ST segment and T-wave abnormalities.

Stress ECG:

    No ST segment changes were observed during this test.  Arrhythmias: None.

2. Echo: 3/29/12:  Nl dimensions.  EF 58%.  Mild mitral regurg.  Mild tricuspid insuff.  Patent foramen ovale.



A/P:  74 yo F with pmh of DM, CRI, Breast Ca, CVA, who is s/p cataract surgery on 09/25/15 presents with two days of unsteady gait, weakness, mild dysarthria and hallucinations.  She has dementia at baseline and has recently had the addition of Diamox, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, to her medications.  This could have had the effect of decreasing her intravascular volume, thus leading to a prerenal state and her increased uremia, and decreased renal clearance of her renally cleared medications, thus leading to acute delirium on chronic dementia.  



Common causes of delirium include FEN disturbances, infections, drug toxicity, metabolic disorders, low perfusion states, withdrawal from alcohol or sedatives, and idiopathic.  In addition, there is the possibility of CVA, however the MRI and CT were negative and the time course and symptoms are not consistent with a CVA.  Of concern though is that she has somewhat atypical signs of delirium such as dysarthria and ataxia.



Metabolic causes of delirium commonly include Na, Ca, Mg, B12, NH3 imbalances.  Her Na, Mg and Ca are wnl.  Her BUN is elevated at 77, which is close to twice her baseline, and in the setting of a fragile patient, this could be enough to tip her over to delirium.  Her glucose was 215 on admission, which is elevated, but only mildly so for a diabetic and not at high enough levels for MS changes to occur.



Infection is possible as her WBC is slightly elevated at 12.1 with 78% poly's.  However, there is no obvious source of infection and she has a normal CXR and U/A, likely ruling out a PNA and UTI respectively.  She has no signs of infection at the site of her eye surgery.  She could have a bacteremia secondary to other infection or due to her procedure, but without a fever, this is highly unlikely.



Her mental status change could be drug induced, as she is on multiple medications with the recent addition of Prednisolone and Vigamox eye drops as well as Diamox that was recently stopped by the family.  Eye drops generally do not get particularly high systemic absorption, although there is an anatomic proximity to the CNS.  However, cardiovascular drugs, antidepressants, and corticosteroids are all known to induce delirium and she is on all of them, including two SSRI's.  The new Diamox could be enough to tip her over as it is a diuretic and by itself it can cause confusion, and by inducing more diuresis, it can cause a prerenal state, thus decreasing renal clearance of her other drugs and increasing their levels, thus leading to delirium.   Indeed, her baseline Creatinine is from 1.6-1.9 and was 2.4 on admission to the ED and her baseline BUN is from 20-40 while it was 82 on admission to the ED.



There is no present concern for drug toxicity and her tox screen was negative.  There was no seizure activity noted and her symptoms have gone on too long to be a post-ictal state



Her BP on admission was 115/51 and her pulse was 62, which does not point to a low perfusion state as a cause.  She had a recent stress test that was negative.  However, it is possible that she has some orthostasis, which would fit with her recent history of falls at home.  However, this would not cause the delirium.



Her dementia has been developing over a few years and the possible etiologies include Alzheimer's, vascular dementia, pseudodementia, thyroid abnormalities, B12 and/or Folate deficiency, tertiary syphilis and chronic infarct dementia.  Chronic infarct dementia is a distinct possibility with MRI of brain showing chronic infarcts in the right posterior frontal and left parietal regions.  Her stasis, DM and high homocysteine levels (18.8 in 2113) are risk factors with PFO for multi-infarct dementia.



Plan:

1. Delirium:  

500 cc bolus of NS, followed by maintenance IVF of 1/2NS at 80cc/hr.

TSH, B12, Folate, RPR, ESR.

D/C her HCTZ, Avapro, Atenolol and recheck her lytes in the AM.  

Call PROMPTCARE in AM for consult re the d/c of Diamox.

Seroquel 12.5 mg overnight.



2. Renal failure:

	likely pre-renal given FeNa<2% and response to fluids in ED

	continue gentle hydration

	D/C HCTZ, Diamox as likely precipitants of delerium and renal failure



3. ID: 	 Cont to monitor for signs/sx of infection.  None currently present.



4. GI:	Elevated Pancreatic Enzymes: 

No signs or symptoms currently.  Cont to follow.

Elevated AST and AlkPhos: Consider ordering a GGT.

Dysphagia: consider a barium swallow.

 

5. FEN: 	Speech and Swallow consult.  Soft diet.



6. Proph: Nexium, Heparin.  PT/OT

Intern addendum:

Pt seen and examined with Gary Aragon, agree with assessment and plan. In brief, 74F with dementia presenting with acute on chronic renal failure and delerium. Etiology likely multifactorial, however, diamox is the only new medication and may explain both her worsening renal failure and delirium. Will pursue broad differential as outlined above.

As noted above on the face. LT and temperature intact. Joint position intact.  Vibration intact.  No evidence of extinction or graphesthesia.



Gait:    Deferred







Labs/Studies:

BUN/Cr 58/2.08 Glu 111 Tn negative W 9.5 plt 262 INR 1.1



A/P: 76 RH F with prior CVA with minimal dysarthria at baseline HTN, HL, here with sx most consistent with idiopathic Bells palsy of the L. face given lower motor neuron distribution of her findings. Other considerations include recrudescence of her prior CVA sx, vs. HTN urgency/emergency.



Plan:

MRI/A of the brain with susceptibility to r/o CVA

BP control goal SBP &lt; 160 mm Hg

If negative for CVA, dx likely idiopathic bells which is a clinical dx. 

If above etiologies CVA, HTn related recrudescence of CVA sx negative, would favor initiating impiric tx for idiopathic bells with steroids and valacyclovir

May continue to follow up with PCP

If sx do not improve after trial of tx for Bells, then call Internal Medicine for appt. 415-726-3969

CC/HPI:  

27yo male from Cedar Hill Lakes, Nevada w/ history of insulin-requiring DM previously followed at Cottage Sanatorium, admitted to Linden Health Care Center after becoming unresponsive during a visit to his sister in Maryland. By report, patient was sitting on the couch at his sister's house, slumped to the floor and had seizure activity x 45seconds that was witnessed by EMS sevices. Accu-checks done at that time were >500 and attempts at intubation were unsuccessful. He was transported to ER, where additional attempts to secure his airway were also unsuccessful, by 2 physicians. There appeared to be some sot of stricture in the upper airway (not obvious on CT scan). However, pt had witnessed emesis, and was placed on 100% nonrebreather mask, with Versed and propofol for sedation with adequate O2 saturation. A x-ray confirmed dependent lung infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonia, and pt was started on Clindamycin.



On arrival to the ER, patient was also found to have a blood pressure of 248/146. He received 50mg dose of labetolol in the ER as well as several additional doses in the ICU. In the ICU, patient did not have any further witnessed seizure activity. A Head CT demonstrated no focal lesion, IC hemorrhage or other abnormality. Pt was treated with dilantin and IV insulin infusion. Serum ketones were negative. Additional workup revealed LVH by EKG criteria, as well as renal insufficiency Cr 2.6. Urine tox was positive for benzos, but was otherwise negative.



Patient also developed leukoytosis (WBC ?) with temp of 102 degrees. Although he had minimal neck stiffness by neurology consult exam, he underwent a lumbar puncture that demonstrated a colorless clear fluid, with glucose of 108, TP 44. Grams stain was negative. Tube #4 contained 21RBCs and 7 WBCs with a diff of 96% PMNs and 4% lymphs. CSF cultures and blood cultures were also done, and are pending.



During his hospital course, patient maintained adequate oxygenation with nasal trumpet in place. ABG on 08/25/61 am was 7.36/PCO2 45/ PO2 366, with bicarb of 25 and 100% sats. His FIO2 was subsequently weaned. He remained hemodynamically stable with BP 184/88 (MAP 114) HR100, RR23, 97% on cannula. Cardiac enzymes were negative. After patient's mother arrived from Georgia, she requested transfer to BMH.



Had no reported history of hypertension or seizure disorders. Mother reports patient having occasional spells in the past, lasting 5-10minutes where patient would become non communicative, associated with elevated glucose.



PMH:

1.	Insulin dependent DM, diagnosed age 12. Was followed at Cottage Sanatorium but has not had PCP or regular care for some time.

EKG: NSR, borderline LVH

CXR:  perihilar opacities, o/w clear.



Assessment and Plan:  27yo h/o insulin dependent DM, not medically followed, p/w witnessed seizure episode in context of severe hypertension.



1.	Neuro - seizure episode / unresponsiveness with non localizing neuro exam. Concern for hypertensive encephalopathy. Pt had LP at outside hospital which did not suggest meningitis. Other possibilities include infarct, encephalitis. Neurology consulted, with recommendations for:

n	EEG 

n	MRI w/ susceptibility  to evaluate for posterior leukoencephalopathy, MRA head/neck, MRV brain

n Dilantin (continued from OSH)

n	Check tox screen, ammonia. Mother has brought in some unknown pills which we will try to identify.

2.	ID - increased WBC, low grade temp s/p LP. No bacterial source for now, but CXR with opacities suspicious for pneumonia. Will start Vancomycin and cefepime empirically, and narrow per culture results. Concern for encephalitis, as HSV can present w/ HTN and seizures. Will ask Linden Health to add HSV PCR to CSF taken from LP prior to transfer. Start Acyclovir empirically in interim.

3.	Resp - s/p multiple attempted intubations at OSH, currently breathing adequately on RA, with audible obstructive physiology. Given need for MRI, may have to sedate and intubate. Will call anesthesia. Continue intubated until MS more alert, for airway protection. Will start ARDSnet for criteria meeting low PaO2/FIO2 ratio and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.

4.	CV- severe hypertension w/ evidence of potential end organ damage (kidney/brain/cardiac). Will control BP w/ Nipride drip, with addition of labetalol for HR control. Target goal 25% decrease to SPB~160 today, and SBP 120 the following day. Check CK/TPNs. Continue IVF for potential rhabdo.

5.	Renal - Renal failure w/ Cr 2.6, unclear baseline. Suspect acute on chronic component given DM w/ poor follow-up. Will check Urine sediment, lytes to evaluate. Reading by me is +hyaline/waxy casts but no WBC or RBC casts. Kidney U/S pending, also with Doppler to evaluate for RAS. Also check urine renin/aldo and 24hr metanephrine for pheochromocytoma, serum metanephrine, and 24hr protein for nephritic syndrome in presence of HTN and hematuria.

6.	Endo - tight glucose control; CZI drip for DM. Has gap but No ketones at OSH; did not arrive in DKA. Will need reg insulin after drip DC'd in future.

7.	Access - PIV

8.	Prophylaxis - nexium, heparin SQ, peridex, HOB 30.

Hematology Note



Fellow: James Tyler

Attending:  Cole Morgan



Date of consultation:  October 04, 2061



Diagnosis:  thrombocytosis, reactive vs. essential thrombocytosis



HPI:

27 yo African American male with recent complicated hospital stay at BMH presents to hematology clinic for first time for follow up of his thrombocytosis.



This 27 yo male with history of type I DM who does not get regular medical care in late August was  visiting family in Maryland and had sudden witnessed seizure activity.  At the time, blood sugar was >500.  Upon initial arrival to the ER in Maryland, he has BP 248/146; plt count was in 800's.  The patient was intubated, treated for HTN with labetolol and placed on IV insulin and dilantin  and transferred to BMH for further care.  



At BMH, MRI showed several small areas of infarct read as concerning for embolic CVA- echo was done showing no vegetations, no PFO, NL EF with LVH; TEE without vegetations as well.  LP was done and sent for HSV which was negative.  He underent a renal workup which showed  nephrotic range proteinuria; labs also showed rhabdoymyolysis.   Renal doppler US showed no sign of RAS.  He was continued on abx for his  aspiration PNA.  Other parts of the secondary htn workup were done including evaluation for hyper aldo, pheo.



The vent was weaned and he was extubated on the 4th.  HTN was controlled with labetolol drip with additional oral agents being added.  He continued to have intermittent fevers and was on broad antibiotics which were originally weaned off.



Hematologically, the hct and wbc fell as he was hydrated.   Plt count stayed stable in the 600's for several days before increasing on the 3rd gradually up to the 1000's.   Retics were depressed at presentation and iron studies were c/w ACD and he was started on epogen.  Initially it was felt that his thrombocytosis was most certainly reactive; CRP was >150 with ESR >100.  He left the ICU and at this point his WBC trended down and he was afebrile and more clinically stable.  But his platelets kept climbing to nearly 1.5 million.  A bone marrow biopsy was done showing no cytogenetics to suggest CML and there were elevated megakaryocytes read as concerning for a myeloproliferative process.  As well, he suffered a DVT in his subclavian/IJ on the same side as a central venous catheter.  Given his thrombocytosis and elevated plt count, he was platelet pheresed twice in the hospital.  As well, hydrea was started at this time, initially at 500mg bid and then escalated to 1000mg bid when his counts were up to 800-900 despite the medication.  As well, he suffered a small GI bleed due to an ulcer.  For this reason he was not anticoagulated but placed upon daily ASA.



He was discharged from the hospital two weeks ago and has done fairly well since then.  His energy has been good.  He denies any fevers/chills/sweats.  No bleeding/bruising.  No further swelling in his arms/legs.  He does have some occasionally blurryness in eyes immediately after taking his anti-hypertensives but no numnbess/weakness/dizziness.

Assessment and Plan:



Interesting case of a 27 yo male with insulin dependent diabetes and apparent untreated HTN who presented with seizure in setting of hypertensive emergency and is found with nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency, several small embolic-appearing strokes and has developed marked thrombocytopenia to 1.5 million and had subsequent provoked DVT.  He was treated for concern of essential thrombocytosis in hospital with platelet pheresis then hydrea.  Today, he presents looking well and still has a thrombocytosis despite the hydrea.  It is still not possible to tell for sure if this is still a reactive thrombocytosis vs Essential thrombocytosis.



At the moment, we will continue to treat this as ET and will continue hydrea at the current dose and ask him to take aspirin 81 mg qd.  If this is a reactive process, time should be a good diagnostic test at this should improve after he is further from his complicated hospital/icu stay.



At his next visit with us next month we will recheck his C-reactive protein, ESR, iron studies/ferritin for some idea of whether his body could still be mounting an inflammatory response to drive a reactive thrombocytosis.  If his plt count comes down, we will be able to start tapering his hydrea at that time.



Of note, in the near future, we may be able to help determine between reactive and essential process with measurement of the JAK2 kinase level.  



In the meantime, he will be meeting with his new PCP and renal physician next week.

Hematology Clinic Progress Note 

Fellow: Inge Logan, MD
Attending:  Cole Morgan, MD, PhD

Date of visit:  March 27, 2062

Diagnosis:  Mr. Goins is a 27 yoM with thrombocytosis here for interval follow-up on hydrea.

Hematologic History:
Mr. Goins is a 27 yo male with history of type I DM formally without regular medical care who was  visiting family in Maryland and had sudden witnessed seizure activity in late August.  At the time, blood sugar was >500.  Upon initial arrival to the ER in Maryland, he has BP 248/146; plt count was in 800's.  The patient was intubated, treated for HTN with labetolol and placed on IV insulin and dilantin  and transferred to BMH for further care.  

At BMH, brain MRI showed several small areas of infarct read as concerning for embolic CVA.  Embolic work-up included an echo which showed no vegetations, no PFO, NL EF with LVH; TEE without vegetations as well.  LP was done and sent for HSV which was negative.  He underwent a renal workup which showed nephrotic range proteinuria with labs also notable for rhabdoymyolysis.   Renal doppler US showed no sign of RAS.  He was continued on abx for his  aspiration PNA.  Other parts of the secondary hypertensive work-up were done including evaluation for hyperaldosteronism and pheochromocytoma.

The vent was weaned and he was extubated on the 4th.  HTN was controlled with labetolol drip with additional oral agents being added.  He continued to have intermittent fevers and was on broad antibiotics which were originally weaned off.

Hematologically, the hct and wbc fell as he was hydrated.   Plt count stayed stable in the 600's for several days before increasing on the 3rd gradually up to the 1000's.   Retics were depressed at presentation and iron studies were c/w ACD and he was started on epogen.  Initially it was felt that his thrombocytosis was most certainly reactive (CRP was >150 with ESR >100).  He left the ICU and at this point his WBC trended down and he was afebrile and more clinically stable.  But his platelets kept climbing to nearly 1.5 million.  A bone marrow biopsy was done showing normal cytogenetics and no evidence for CML.  His bone marrow did demonstrate elevated megakaryocytes, concerning for a myeloproliferative process.  As well, he suffered a DVT in his subclavian/IJ on the same side as a central venous catheter.  Given his thrombocytosis and elevated plt count, he was platelet pheresed twice in the hospital.  As well, hydrea was started at this time, initially at 500mg bid and then escalated to 1000mg bid when his counts were up to 800-900 despite the medication.  As well, he suffered a small GI bleed due to an ulcer.  For this reason he was not anticoagulated but placed upon daily ASA.  He was discharged from the hospital in September.   

Since then he has been followed in hematology clinic.  Initially, his platelets were still in the hi 500's despite hydrea at 1000 bid.  His hematocrit was mildly depressed at this point as well (29-31%). He was re-evaluated on 12/05/61.  His platelets were 502,000.  An epo level was drawn and his hydrea was increased to 1500/1000mg.  He was re-evaluated on 12/26/61 and found to have a hematocrit of 26.2%, WBC of 2.7K, and platelets of 508,000.  His hydrea was decreased to 500mg bid. 

Interval History:
Since his last visit, he left for Wynne for one month.  When he returned, his creatinine had increased to 4.0.  A renal biopsy performed last week showed diabetic nephropathy.  He is being evaluated by Dr. Xing for dialysis and renal transplant evaluation.  

In terms of his blood disorders, the patient has been at his baseline fatigue, slightly improving over the past few months.  He has no fevers, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss.  He had one episode of transient global blurry vision 3 weeks ago which resolved on its own and has not recurred.  He has no headaches, other sensory deficits, or focal neurologic symptoms.  He has no oral ulcers or skin lesions from his Hydrea.

Assessment and Plan:
Mr. Goins is a 27 yo male with insulin dependent diabetes and apparent untreated HTN who presented with seizure in setting of hypertensive emergency, subsequently found to have nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency, and several small embolic-appearing strokes.  In this setting, he has developed marked thrombocytosis to 1.5 million and had subsequent provoked DVT.  He was treated with platelet pheresis, then hydrea.  It has been unclear if this is still a reactive thrombocytosis vs essential thrombocytosis.  We are following his CBC on hydrea.

His platelets are moderately elevated (757K).  He has no evidence of recurrent thrombosis.  His current hydrea dosing cannot be increased due to his anemia.  We would advise starting erythropoetin, monitoring his blood pressure closely.  At his current platelet count, his risk of thrombosis is not greatly increased, especially as his platelets are dysfunctional due to uremia.  We would advise continuing current hydrea. 

Continue current hydrea
Monitor counts monthly
Agree with starting erythropoetin in Internal Medicine. 
Return in 4 months for follow-up of counts

The patient was seen and discussed with Dr. Morgan.

Internal Medicine

BARTON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL



History of present illness

			

  This was a followup visit for this 28-year-old black man with the medical problems of type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, thrombocytosis, and chronic renal insufficiency. The patient states that since I last saw him, he is being evaluated further for renal transplant. In addition, attempts were made to place an AV fistula for dialysis in his right arm and this did not work out. Given that this one did not work out, a decision was made to wait to see if there was a transplant candidate for him to get a renal transplant rather than put all of the pieces in place for hemodialysis if in fact he would need it. Most recently, the patient's creatinine was 6.4 and his BUN was 46 two weeks ago.



Major Problems





Diabetes mellitus

Type 1 diabetes mellitus.  The patient's diabetes is currently well controlled on his current regimen of NPH and Regular Insulin.  Most recently, his hemoglobin A1c was 6.6 on 02/27/2062.  The patient states that all of his fingersticks at home have been consistently between 70 and 110.



Chronic renal insufficiency

The patient is being evaluated for renal transplant and possible candidate that his family members and friends will be tested to see whether there are a match shortly.



Hypertension

The patient is on a tremendous amount of medication to treat his hypertension. Currently, he is on labetalol 600 mg PO BID, furosemide 20 mg PO QD, clonidine 0.3 mg PO QHS, lisinopril 40 mg PO QD, and nifedipine XL 90 mg PO QHS. BHypertension is currently well controlled on this regimen.



Erectile dysfunction

The patient was experiencing erectile dysfunction largely on Toprol.  For this reason, the Toprol was discontinued and the patient is having less of a problem with this issue currently.



Anemia

The patient's anemia is due to multiple different factors.  He has recently been started on erythropoietin, which he is getting via injection in the Internal Medicine three times a week.  Most recently, his hematocrit was 29.4% two weeks ago.



Thrombocytosis

The patient is on Hydria 500 mg PO QD for this problem and he is being followed by Hematology.



Hyperlipidemia

The patient's hyperlipidemia is new.  Most recently, his lipids were done on 02/27/2062 and at that time his total cholesterol was 294 and his LDL was 209.  This is a new problem for the patient, given that his lipids were fairly normal six months ago.  Given this, the patient was started on Lipitor 20 mg PO QD for hyperlipidemia.  We will repeat his lipid panel at the time of his next visit in eight weeks.

A/P:  28 yo man with DM1, ESRD-HD, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, thrombocytosis, here with hypertensive emergency. His BP has remained high, so will attempt to reduce by 25% MAP for a few hours and then start an oral agent.  Nitroprusside will be used first but if he needs an extended treatment, will change to nicardipine (Bj Q Sugudoyta 1165 Glb;7(9 Kk 1):414-8) given his ESRD.  His change in mental status is likely due to hypertensive encephalopathy, but it is hard to exclude other sources of end-organ involvement such as the heart (especially considering his thrombocytosis) given his ongoing confusion.  Other sources of his confusion might include meningitis given his leukocytosis. 



1.	CV

a.	Pump

i.	Has an S3, but no signs of L or R heart failure.

ii.	Will reduce afterload prog

b.	Rhythm

i.	Sinus tachycardia, will give IVFs to reduce high-reninemic natriuretic state.

i.	No EKG changes consistent with ischemia, will cycle cardiac biomarkers x 3, give ASA, Lipitor.

ii.	Will reduce afterload with Nitroprusside, IVFs, po anti-hypertensives.

2.	Neuro

a.	His mental status and leukocytosis are likely due to hypertensive encephalopathy but potentially concerning for possible meningitis. Will perform lumbar puncture, hold Abx since he has been in the hospital for more than 6h, give if CSF studies indicate it.

b.	Neuro following.

3.	HTN

a.	Will reduce MAP by 25% to ~100, will start with Nitroprusside, switch to Nicardipine. Will re-start some oral agents once reduced.

I have reviewed the resident's note on the record and seen and

examined the patient personally.  I concur with the resident's

findings.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is an extraordinarily

complex 47-year-old patient with renal insufficiency, nephrotic

syndrome, and severe anemia who was scheduled to receive some

intravenous iron today but the presence of multiple abnormalities

in her blood prompted her to be referred here instead for

admission.  She herself complains of generalized weakness but

does not have any localizing or acute new symptoms.  Remainder of

history and physical examination were reviewed and verified and

are as noted.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert.  Speech is

normal in rate, rhythm, and quality.  Skin is warm and dry.  She

is in no distress.  She has some bibasilar moist rales but heart

sounds are completely normal.

LABORATORY DATA:  As noted and have multiple abnormalities.  It

was reflected on the record.  Calcium is 5.5, albumin is 1.7,

creatinine is 7.0, and the remainder as noted.  Electrocardiogram

does not show any acute changes.

IMPRESSION:  This patient has anemia, hypocalcemia, and

hypomagnesemia.  We discussed this with the Internal Medicine who

will be admitting her to see if they can get her in better

metabolic balance.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:

1.  Anemia.

2.  Hypocalcemia.

3.  Hypomagnesemia.

4.  Nephrotic syndrome.

5.  Renal failure.

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be admitted to hospital.

This patient was seen with resident, Dr. Elmore.  Resident's

note was reviewed.  The patient was seen and examined by me, and

I confirm the resident's findings.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In brief, Ms. Kimbrough is a

46-year-old woman with history of hypothyroidism, anxiety,

diabetes, and nephrotic syndrome.  She is also dialysis

dependent.  Her last dialysis was yesterday, she developed acute

onset chest pressure with severe shortness of breath and

diaphoresis while at home.  Called EMS and was brought to the

Emergency Department.  The patient is unable to give a full

history and at this time secondary to her significant respiratory

distress.  Please review resident's note for full details of

obtainable past medical history, social history, review of

systems, medications, and allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  I confirm the physical exam is as

documented.  The patient is awake in severe respiratory distress.

 Pulse is 126, respirations 40, blood pressure is initially noted

at 253/129, and oximetry is 92% on facemask.  Physical exam

reveals a diaphoretic woman who is breathing rapidly with

accessory muscle use, nasal flaring and tripoding.  She has rales

halfway up bilaterally with inspiratory and expiratory wheezes. 

Cardiac exam reveals tachycardia.  Abdomen is obese but soft. 

Extremity exam reveals bilateral 3+ edema up to the knees. 

Rectal exam reveals trace heme-positive stool that is brown.

On route, the patient received multiple doses of sublingual

nitroglycerin as well as IV Lasix.  She is known to make urine, a

Foley catheter was placed immediately.  IV access was

established, and the patient received large doses of diuretics. 

Was immediately started on IV nitroglycerin and a BiPAP.  On

BiPAP, the patient's oxygenation was 100%.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs were obtained, which showed a hematocrit

of 36, and BUN and creatinine of 15 and 5.1.  BNP was noted at

700.  Cardiac enzymes:  CK was 334, CK-MB 4.9, and troponin was

less than assay.  However, labs were obtained within half an hour

of her symptoms starting, magnesium was low at 1.6.  Urinalysis

was negative and urine HCG was negative.  EKG was sinus

tachycardia without any ST or T-wave changes concerning for

rate-related ischemia.  There were no prior EKGs available. 

Chest x-ray showed bilateral CHF.  The Nephrology fellow covering

hemodialysis was notified that the patient would need immediate

hemodialysis and this was scheduled for 6:00 a.m.

DIAGNOSIS:  End-stage renal disease, hemodialysis dependent, and

CHF.

ASSESSMENT:  Given the patient's constellation of symptoms, it is

likely that she had an ischemic event that caused flash pulmonary

edema and subsequent symptomatology.  Given the current regimen,

in the Emergency Department, the patient gradually improved.  The

respiratory rate was noted at 23.  Her heart rate came down to

113 and blood pressure was well controlled on the IV

nitroglycerin noted finally at 140/77.  The patient was taken to

hemodialysis at 7:45 and admitted to the hospital thereafter for

This patient was seen with resident, Dr. Penn, whose note was

reviewed and confirmed by me.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 46-year-old woman with

end-stage renal disease secondary to minimal chain disease, on

hemodialysis, presenting with severe hypertension, headache,

nausea, and vomiting in the setting of blood pressures in the

200s/100s today.

Please review resident's note for full details of past medical

history, social history, review of systems, medications, and

allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  I confirm the physical exam is as

documented.  The patient is awake, alert, and appears to be in

mild to moderate discomfort.  Vital signs reveal pulse of 108,

respirations 22, blood pressure 226/129, and oximetry is 96% on

room air.  The patient is afebrile.  HEENT exam reveals well

visualized disks bilaterally on funduscopic exam.  There is no

papilledema noted.  Posterior pharynx is clear.  Lungs are clear

to auscultation with good air movement throughout.  Heart is

regular.  Abdomen is soft.  Extremity exam reveals no cyanosis,

clubbing, or edema.  Neurologic:  The patient is intact.  There

is a left brachiocephalic shunt noted with a good thrill easily

palpable.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count is 5.4, hematocrit 45, BUN and

creatinine 31 and 6.0, potassium is noted at 5.3%, cardiac

enzymes flat, and coags are unremarkable.

IMAGING STUDIES:  EKG is sinus rhythm without any ST or T-wave

changes concerning for ischemia.  Head CT shows no acute

processes.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was given IV fluids and

treated with Zofran for her nausea, labetalol 200 mg p.o.

followed by 10 mg intravenously, which brought her pressure down

very nicely to 168/86.  After fluids, Zofran, and blood pressure

control, her symptoms improved dramatically.  She was admitted to

the Observation Unit to monitor her blood pressure overnight with

anticipated discharge in the morning.

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

DIAGNOSIS:  Hypertensive urgency.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47-year-old female who returns to the clinic for a followup visit.  The patient has multiple medical problems including severe and extreme hypertension as well as high blood pressure and chronic renal failure for which she is currently attending dialysis sessions 3 times per week.  The patient also is currently being treated for hot flashes with Prempro.  The patient states that she ran out of her blood pressure medications including the patch 2 days ago.  She also complains of frequent popping and loss of hearing in her right ear.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A middle-aged female in no acute distress.  Blood pressure is 182/94, weight is 211 pounds, and pulse is 76.  Chest is clear bilaterally.  Heart, regular rate and rhythm, positive S1, S2.  Negative S3, S4, no murmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, positive bowel sounds.  Lower extremities, no edema, nontender.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1.  Chronic renal failure, on dialysis.  The patient appears to be doing much better and has stabilized on her regular dialysis sessions.  She is still waiting for donor for a renal transplant.  She will follow up with nephrology as scheduled.  She is currently being immunized for her transplant and will receive her third hepatitis B shot as well as her second hepatitis A shot today.

2.  Right ear problem.  The patient has wax buildup in her right ear and I recommended that she use olive oil on a nightly basis to resolve the earwax.

3.  Diabetes mellitus.  Control is much better.  There is a recent hemoglobin A1c of 6.3.

4.  Severe hyperlipidemia, which has improved after the patient was started on dialysis.  Of note, was also a very high HDL.  The patient is currently on no hypolipemic medication.  We will check a fasting lipid profile at this point.

5.  Severe hypertension.  Prescriptions for nifedipine and the clonidine patch were refilled.

6.  Hyperparathyroidism.  We will check a PTH level today.

Neurology MEDIQUIK Senior Note



9/26/75

5:00AM

Patient Name: Percy Carrillo

MRN: 1668727



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Please see neurology PGY2 note for full details. In brief the patient is a 62 yo man with mental retardation, HTN, hyperlipidemia, head trauma with SDH with evacuation, DM who presents with gait instability and difficulty with speaking and swallowing. Per guardian the patient was in his USOH until 9/24/75 evening at approximately 8:30pm he was found to have mumbled speech and having difficulty with ambulation with leaning to the left. On 9/25/75 in the morning he had a fall when getting out of bed and struck his head, and brought to the ED. No prior history of stroke or TIA. 



MEDS: ASA, Metformin, Glyberide, Tegretol, Fosinoperil, Lipitor, HCTZ

			

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

VITALS: 	BP 130/85

MS:	AA&Ox3, speech fluent with slurring (unclear baseline), repeats and names well.  Comprehends simple commands.  Names president

CN: 	PERRL, VF full with BTT. EOMI but with nystagmus in all directions of gaze, even primary gaze. Facial sensation intact.  Face asymmetric. Tongue, palate symmetric.  SCM and traps 5/5. 

Motor:	UMN pattern weakness in RUE (4-/5), most notable in hands. Mild  proximal RLE weak (4+/5).  

Coord:	Impaired FTN in LUE, intact in RUE.   

Refl:	Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ at biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patella, and ankles.  Plantar response is flexor on right and extensor on left.             

Sens:              Decreased PP but NOT LT in LUE and LLE 



Imaging: 

MRI Brain (9/25/75)     DWI bright ADC dark right lateral medullary pyramid with associated increased T2 signal.

MRA Head/Neck (9/25/75)     Narrowing of basilar artery with flow signal throughout and no thrombosis  

CTA Head/Neck (9/25/75)     Diffuse atherosclerotic disease, occluded R-ICA with good collateralization of right hemisphere, severe irregular narrowing through out bilateral vertebral arteries and basilar arteries. 



IMPRESSION: The patient has numerous risk factors for stroke with HTN, DM2, and HLP. His exam is consistent with lateral medullary pyramid lesion with involvement of spinalcortical tract prior to decussation explaining ipsilateral weakness and also involvement of the spinalthalamic tract explaining contralateral deficit in pain sensation. His vessel imaging is notable and concerning for diffuse atherosclerotic disease, specifically in posterior circulation in distribution of acute stroke. The patient was reportedly taking aspirin, though reports are mixed and this needs clarification. Vessel imaging did not implicate that the patient suffered from acute vertebro-basilar thrombo-embolism, but that his posterior circulation disease is a chronic issue and the stroke was more likely due to distal vessel thrombosis. Anticoagulation can be considered in acute setting of small sized posterior circulation stroke with vertebro-basilar disease, but in this case by the time the patient became known to neurology service and by the time it was known he had a stroke it was some 24hrs after initial symptoms, and in this interval he did not show any signs or symptoms of stroke progression making unstable plaque unlikely. Given the findings of the WASID study that anticoagulation did not significantly improve recurrent stroke prevention benefits over aspirin for symptomatic vertebro-basilar disease (because warfarin benefits were offset by higher hemorrhage rates), the decision to place this patient on aspirin is supported. The long term management of this patient requires aggressive control of atherosclerotic risk factors such as HTN, DM2, and HLP. The patient is significantly at risk of major ischemic stroke due to occluded right carotid artery and diffuse posterior circulation disease, and it is conceivable that if he continues to have persistent symptoms in the future that a revascularization procedure may be necessary.   



RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.	Aspirin 325 mg po qd

2.	Continue Lipitor 

3.	HTN management as an outpatient, autoregulate x 24hrs for SBP<180 mmHg  

4.	DM2 management 

5.	Check lipids, homocysteine, lipoprotein a, hba1c

6.	Check TCDs to obtain baseline data

7.	Consider TTE/Holter as outpatient as unlikely this was a cardioembolic event

 MANAMANA nfectious Disease Consultation Note

Patient: Vincent Ware (71417347     2Y)
Student:  Casey Best, MS-4
ID Fellow: Tina Isaiah-Villagomez MD
ID Attending: Alexander Y Xian MD
Referring Physician: Webster MD
Date of Consult: September 20, 2073

Reason for consult:  cough, nightsweats and weightloss, two days prior to transplant

HPI: 66 yo M with h/o IDDM, large cell lymphoma in 2066, and now with myelodysplastic syndrome.  He was treated with CHOP in 2066 followed by radiotherapy, completed in Nov 2066.  He was free of disease since then until May 2073.  He sought primary care for a URI and was noted to be anemic (HCT 31).  His counts were followed and when his HCT dropped as low as 22 a Bone Marrow was done and showed myelodysplastic syndrome.  He was considered for a allogenic stem-cell transplant.  His major complaint is a dry cough that he has had since May 2073.   It is provoked by eating, drinking and lying down.  And only occasionally does he produce any sputum.  He has been on numerous antibiotics in the past four months for the cough and he also developed a periorbital cellulitis for which he was hospitalized at Educare-Fargo for which he received a 3 week course of Ceftriaxone, Nafcillin and flagyl (finished at the end of July).  In retrospect, he recognizes sinus pressure/congestion associated with periorbital cellulitis.  In August 2073 he had a questionable LLL PNA and was treated with cipro.  On pre-transplant work-up, CXR revealed increase    conspicuity of ill-defined LL zone opacity.      CT chest reviewed today revealed mutlifocal pneumonia with associated radiation-related changes.  

Throughout this time period he has only had a few days of fever for which he was at KCGH and given abx and defervesced.  He recalls    nightsweats    as the fevers broke.  He does admit to maybe a 10 lb weight loss in the past 4 months.  He denies SOB (unless he   s severely anemic), orthopnea, sore throat, dysphagia, odynophagia, CP, palpitations, angina-like symptoms, acid-reflux, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, dysuria, frequency, nocturia, joint or muscle pain.  He does have mild peripheral neuropathy in his feet bilaterally.

      IMPRESSION: Chest PA and lateral views are compared to prior  done on 9/18/2073. Paramediastinal opacification is changed.  Cardiomediastinal silhoutte is stable. Nodular opacity in the  left perihilar region appears less apparent. No new consolidations are seen. There is a new left-sided Hickman catheter with its tip in the SVC. No pneumothorax is seen .
      
Impression:
66 yo M with h/o IDDM, large cell lymphoma in 2066, and now with myelodysplastic syndrome who presents with fourth months of cough of unclear etiology.

The differential diagnosis is broad and includes both infectious and non-infectious diagnoses.  Our leading diagnosis is either radiation fibrosis or a primary interstitial lung disease, such as COP.  However, we also think that several infectious etiologies should be considered.  Endemic mycoses (histo, blasto and crypto), cryptococcal pneumonia, nocardiasis, aspergillus, mucormycosis and MAC are some diseases to consider in this patient.  While the clinical picture of granulomas on chest CT and cough is consistent with the diagnosis of mycobacterial disease, the patient is very low risk for this infection and his lack of fevers, progressive weight loss and systemic illness argues against this diagnosis.  

I (AYX) have interviewed and examined Mr. Ware, and confirmed all of the findings documented in this note.   My highest suspicion is for an inflammatory process, such as radiation pneumonitis or BOOP/COP.  An occult infection is quite possible, such as pulmonary MAC or a mold (the lesion in his left lower lobe is especially suspicious).  Clinically he is unchanged over many months, so empiric antibiotics would not be indicated.    

 We recommend the following work-up:

-Expectorated sputum for gram stain and culture
-Induced sputum for
-PCP
-Modified AFB smear (looking for Nocardia)
-Fungal stain and culture
-Urine histo antigen
-Serum cryptococcal antigen
-Weekly monitoring of galactomannan and D-glucan
-Nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory viral panel (RSV, Adenovirus, Influenza A and B, paraflu A and B) and viral culture

If the above work-up is unrevealing, please consult pulmonology for a bronchoscopy -- sooner rather than later.

It is reasonable to start is levaquin 500 mg QD now to treat empirically for typical and atypical pathogens (this medication is scheduled to begin in two days, per protocol).

Our recommendations were communicated to Dr. Dalton and Dr. Robin Jeffery of the patient   s primary team.  Thank you for this consult.  Our team will follow with you

EDVISIT^98044905^WARE, VINCENT^12/21/74^VILLA, SCOTT

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea on exertion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Ware is a 67-year-old man with

a history of diabetes and myelodysplastic syndrome, status post

stem cell transplant who presents to the Emergency Department

with a 2 to 3 week history of increasing exertional dyspnea.  The

patient denies chest pain, palpitations, or syncope but does

complain of bilateral lower extremity edema times several weeks. 

The patient has been worked up for the symptoms as an outpatient

and placed on Lasix for the past 2 weeks and had an

echocardiogram today, which was remarkable for atrial

fibrillation.  The patient was sent to the Emergency Department

for further evaluation.  Please see the written record for

further details.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin-dependent diabetes,

myelodysplastic syndrome, status post stem cell transplant.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Basal cell resection.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies smoking, alcohol, or illicit

drug use.

MEDICATIONS:  Lasix, vitamin D, Lantus, and acyclovir.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  I have examined the patient and agree with

the physical as documented.  Of note, the patient is awake and

alert, in no acute distress.  Vitals:  Temperature is 96.9, pulse

is 100 to 128, respiratory rate of 18, blood pressure is 118/70,

and oxygen saturation is 96%.  Lungs:  Clear bilaterally with no

rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Cardiovascular exam:  Irregularly

irregular rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.  No murmurs.  Abdomen:  Soft

with no tenderness, guarding, or rebound.  Extremity exam:  The

patient has bilateral lower extremity 2+ pitting edema, left

greater than right.  No calf tenderness.

MEDICAL DECISION MAKING AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Mr.

Ware is a 67-year-old man with diabetes and a 2-week history of

increasing dyspnea on exertion.  His chest x-ray did not

demonstrate pulmonary edema, but was significant for bilateral

pleural effusions.  The patient's EKG demonstrated a flutter with

a ventricular rate of 121 with inferolateral T-wave inversions. 

The patient was given IV and p.o. Cardizem with control of the

ventricular rate.  At the time of this dictation, the patient's

laboratory data are not available.  The plan is to admit the

patient to the hospital for further management.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  New onset AFib.

DISPOSITION:  Admission.

CONDITION UPON ADMISSION:  Good.

MRN: 98044905

DATE OF ADMISSION: 3/02/75
DATE OF CONSULT: 3/03/75
ID ATTENDING: Haney


ID FELLOW: Riddle

SERVICE ATTENDING: Vann
REASON FOR CONSULT: Cough, dyspnea, fevers s/p HSCT off immune suppression


HPI:

Mr. Ware is a 67-year-old man with a history non-Hodgkins's lymphoma (spinal mass, s/p CHOP, radiation, in long term remission) and secondary MDS s/p reduced intensity allo-HSCT 12/73.  His post-tx course was unremarkable.  Peritransplant he devloped a multifocal PNA of unclear etiology. Pretransplant imaging showed peribronchial thickening, and post transplant a tree &amp; bud appearance with more focal areas of consolidation. Per the patient, he had a dry hacking cough with occaisional fevers and night sweats that lasted from April through November of 73 and resolved on their own.  He had several courses of quinolones (and other abx) during this period without significant relief, but ultimately his symptoms improved on their own.  His immune suppression was d/c'd 7/74.  He deveoloped iron overload (Ferritin 1356) and started phlebotomy 9/74.   


Mr. Ware did well from a respiratory standpoint until 11/74 when he noticed intermittent fevers approximately every 2 weeks.   At first they were in the 99 range and they would last 1-2days and be associated with malaise.  He also again experienced symptoms of a dry hacking cough that occurs with change in positioning (not necessarily lying flat).  By the end of November, the fevers were a bit higher (100.5).  He saw his PCP who thought he might have PNA.  He obtained a CXR and gave hime a course ofr azithromycin (5d). His fevers improved.  In early December, he began experienceing SOB with exertional dyspnea.  He saw his PCP again who rx avelox.  He got another CXR which showed some ""fluid"" and was strated on lasix.  He was also referred for echocardiogram, PFTs, and chest CT.  On arrival, he was found to be in AFB w/RVR. 


He was admitted from 12/21-01/02. He was rate controlled and had minimal diuresis.  Cardiac MRI suggested constrictive pericarditis and possible areas of active pericarditis.  Right &amp; left heart cath which showed no evidence of cosntriction hemodynamically. He had 1 temperature to 101.4, and given his history he was seen by our service.  Blood cultures were negative. Induced sputum was negative for AFB x 3. He and influenza/rsv/paraflu/adnevorus nasal swabs which were also negative. Sputum cultures grew oral flora. CMV VL, glucan, and galactomannan were also negative. 


He improved w/regard to SOB but cough persisted.  He was seen by Dr. Vann who was concerned for an immunologic process given his bilateral pleural effusions &amp; question of pericarditis. He had a URI syndrome in January that lasted 3 weeks then resolved.  On February 19th, he noticed the onset of low-grade temps (100.0-100.5) with malaise and mild chills.  These happened nightly through. He saw his PCP 2/23 who rx moxifloxacin. He had no change in his symptoms.  He had some mild rhinorrhea and mildly increased SOB.  He denies CP, abdominal pain, HA, N/V/D, joint pain, skin rashes, dysuria.  His son had a ""head cold"" prior to the onset of his symptoms.  No other sick contacts.  He was admitted for further workup. 



He is up tp date received influenza &amp; pneumococcal vaccines.

CHEST CT 3/03: Pericardial effusion has resolved without apparent  change in bilateral pleural effusions since 12/14/2074. Prior granulomatous infection is evident. 



TTE:
The left ventricle is normal in size. Overall left ventricular function is mildly to moderately reduced. The estimated ejection fraction is 40-45%. There is global hypokinesis with regional  variation. There is septal ?bounce? raising the possibility of constrictive  physiology.
IMPRESSION &amp; RECOMMENDATIONS:
67yoM with h/o NHL in remission, secondary MDS s/p non myeloabaltive allo BMT now off all immune suppression since 7/74 presenting with fevers, SOB, and malaise.  He has not yet had documented fevers in the hospital, but his rhinorrhea after sick contact during this season is suggestive of a viral syndrome.  He has chronically mildly elevated LFTs which are stable.  He has a new mild eospinophila of unclear etiology. 
-nasopharyngeal swab AND pertussis IgM/IgG for pertussis given persistent cough and low grade temps
-f/u respiratory viral panel
-given mild eosinophilia, can check strongyloides antibody and stool for ova and parasites though no clear exposure history, would also check urinary histo Ag and cocciodes IgM/IgG (given old granulomatous disease on chest CT)
-would consider AM cortisol to r/o adrenal insufficiency 
-would repeat hepatitis serologies (HepB sAG, cAB, sAB, HepA AB, HepC Ab) given persistent mildly elevated LFTs
-would check toxoplasma DNA given risk of dz post-transplant

The patient was seen and examined in the Emergency Department on

08/15/2087.  The patient was seen by Dr. Kaminski.  I have discussed

the management with her.  I have also seen the patient personally

and reviewed the medical record.  This is an addendum to the

medical record.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 50-year-old female who is

sent in by her primary doctor after having had EKG changes today.

 Her history, which I personally obtained and in review of the

record, she has a history of sarcoidosis, recently has had

increased cough and some shortness of breath, given albuterol

with symptomatic improvement yesterday and returned today with

some persistent pain, which she says is generally related to

cough.  She has had no fevers, chills, or shortness of breath.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As indicated and otherwise negative.  She is

asymptomatic at this time.  She has had no recent travel.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a nonsmoker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is very well appearing,

pleasant and in no acute distress.  Her vital signs are stable. 

She is normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pharynx and ENT is normal. 

Neck is supple and nontender.  Chest is clear.  Heart is regular

with normal pulses.  Abdomen is soft and nontender without masses

that are appreciated.  Skin is warm and dry.  She has no CVA

tenderness, no back tenderness.  She is awake, alert, and

oriented.  Sensory and motor exam are normal.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a woman who complains of having had

some chest discomfort.  She has a history of sarcoid and has EKG,

which I reviewed, which shows lateral T-wave changes as suggested

by her referring doctor.  She is pain free.  Initial lab results

show hematocrit of 40, INR of 1, and a troponin which was

negative.

Plan at this time is for hospital admission to rule out MI given

her EKG change.  She looks clinically stable.

of occasional brief palpitations now with one hour of continuous

palpitations and ECG consistent with atrial flutter.  She was

given 20 mg of diltiazem IV by EMS.  In the Emergency Department,

she was given 20 mg without significant response, followed by 40

mg ID and was achieved a good response.  As the patient required

a significant amount of diltiazem to slow her rate and convert

her and she is also feeling somewhat nervous, we will keep her in

the Observation Unit overnight.  She should get an oral dose of

diltiazem overnight.  She should get cardiac monitoring in the

morning.

PLAN:  To discuss with KEKELA Cardiology and obtain consultation as

to possible discharge on beta-blockers versus calcium channel

blockers.  If the patient does not have a new symptoms she would

be stable for discharge in the morning.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular

response.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Left arm pain.

CRITICAL CARE TIME:  35 minutes.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53-year-old female

with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension and

atrial fibrillation who comes in to the ER complaining of

sensation of a racing heart since 5:10 p.m. in the evening.  She

said it was acute onset and felt like palpitations.  She also

said it felt like a burning.  She had mild shortness of breath

and left arm achiness.  She had no nausea, no vomiting, no fevers

or chills.  She had no trauma, no lightheadedness, and no

syncope.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes,

and atrial fibrillation.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Not related.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco or occasional alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Palpitations, otherwise negative.

MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, the patient missed two doses today,

aspirin, simvastatin, glyburide and NovoLog.

ALLERGIES:  Erythromycin and IV dye.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97, heart rate 155,

respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 136/52, O2 100% on 2 liters. 

The patient is awake and alert, well developed, well nourished,

talking in complete sentences, in no acute distress.  ENT: 

Atraumatic, normal to inspection.  Eyes are normal.  Neck: 

Normal to inspection, supple, and nontender.  Respiratory:  Clear

to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and

rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  GI:  Abdomen is soft and

nontender.  Skin is intact, warm, and dry.  Back is nontender. 

Musculoskeletal:  No lower extremity swelling or edema. 

Neuropsychiatric:  Oriented x3.  Mood and affect is normal. 

Cranial nerves II through XII tested and intact.  No motor or

sensory deficits.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Initial EKG showed a rate of about

150, unclear.  It seemed that there was T waves in V3.  There is

no evidence of ST elevation MI.  We thought this could be an SVT.

 It was not really consistent with an atrial fibrillation.  Our

plan was to give adenosine, however, during the IV placement. 

Prior to giving adenosine, the patient converted to a normal

sinus rhythm with mild tachycardia at around 100, but it was

clear that there was T waves.  At this point, we decided to give

her baseline metoprolol dose and she missed two doses.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs checked include sodium of 139, potassium

3.7, chloride 104, bicarbonate 23, BUN 14, creatinine 0.81,

glucose 268.  ALT 19, AST 18, CK 350, alkaline phosphatase 128,

total bilirubin 0.5, CK-MB 5.2, troponin I less than 0.04,

calcium 9.1, and mag 1.9.  White blood cells 10.29, hematocrit

42.7, and platelets 438, 000.  INR is 1.  UA is negative for

infection with trace blood present.

PLAN:  Our plan is to check two more enzymes because the patient

had the left arm heaviness during the palpitations.  If both of

those enzymes are negative, we feel that she is safe to go home

from the ED Observation Unit.  It is unclear the etiology of her

arrhythmia.  It did seem to be likely SVT, which broke

spontaneously.  The patient is to follow up with her primary

doctor.

DISPOSITION:  ED Observation Unit.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Satisfactory.

I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the patient,

reviewed the resident's documentation, the patient's chart,

discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the

patient.

54 yo male from Kazakhstan here for f/u of GI mucor.  Briefly, he was admitted 6/20/62 with DKA and MSSA bacteremia.  He was found to have perirectal abscess s/p CT-guided drains as well as L hip infected prosthesis and abscess s/p removal and drainage in OR on 7/07 and by IR 7/22, both sites positive for MSSA.  Hospital course c/b GIB and was found to have free air with perforated duodenum s/p ex-lap 6/22, gastrectomy with partial large bowel resection, splenectomy and primary anastamosis, with path positive for mucormycosis without clean margins.  He also had VRE/klebsiella LUQ abscess s/p IR drainage.  

He was initially treated with nafcillin and ambisome, but developed maculopapular rash on chest and arms thought to be secondary to nafcillin.  So he was switched to vanco/ambisome/linezolid/meropenem/amikacin for LUQ abscess.  After 6 weeks of high-dose ambisome, he was taken back to OR on 7/31 for re-exploration and was found to have some more necrosis around his esophageal-jejunostomy site that surgeons ""scooped out"" as much as they could, but were not able to get clean margins because of difficult anatomic restrictions. 
Given the inability to completely en-bloc resect Mr. Ethridge's GI mucor despite a long-trial of Ambisome, he was started on an investigational drug, posaconazole, provided by Emcor on a compassionate use basis.  This has had 50% success of curing mucor as salvage therapy in small trials.  He was started on this drug on 8/28/62 and has tolerated it well despite some nausea, diarrhea.  

He has been at EDUCARE-FARGO reports increase in strength and improved ability to bear weight on his hip.  He walks with a walker.  He had repeat CT abd/pelvix 10/26 which showed no intraabdominal collection and stable L hip collection.  He had abd drains removed 3 weeks ago but continues to have L hip drain, without much output.  He was started on TPN 1 week ago due to maltrition, despite po intake.  He has been trying to eat, but reports some nausea and diarrhea, especially after he eats and since starting posaconazole.  He reports good glycemic control.  He denies fevers/abd pain/nightsweats/chills/visual changes/HA/melena/cough/SOB.

Imp:

54 yo male with DM s/p long hospital course for DKA, multiple infections in hip and abd, and GI mucor s/p resection x2, but with residual disease.  Currently on posaconazole and tolerating well, but does have significant nausea, somewhat controlled with zofran.  Diarrhea can be a component posaconazole side effect, or due to dumping syndrome.



Plan:

1) continue posaconazole

2) need to have ortho f/u to evaluate L hip collection

3) RTC in 1 month 12/04/62 at 10am to f/u for posaconazole.  Will need EKG again at EDUCARE-FARGO before transfer here.



Mr. Ethridge seen and examined with Dr. Roberts.  He is very slowly improving in terms of strength, no doubt in part due to nocturnal TPN.  Hard to tease out the cause of his nausea, although anatomic reasons are as likely as medication side effects.  On balance, if his labs are ok, I'd favor continuing the posaconazole given most recent OR findings.  ECG without QTc prolongation.  Abdomen is bening.  Left hip still sore, but more and more stable.

Medical Record #: 	8381729

Date of Admission: 	01/08/64
Attending: 		Dr. Burton



CC/ID:	clotted AV fistula / renal failure



HPI: 	The patient is a 55 year old male with a past medical history significant for chronic renal failure (secondary to diabetes & hypertension) and gastrointestinal mucormycosis who underwent an arteriovenous graft placement ten days prior to admission. The patient was doing well until a few days prior to admission when he noticed a swelling in his new graft and a decrease in the degree of its pulse. Then on the morning of admission when he noticed his graft was without a palpable pulse or thrill. The patient then presented to the EDUCARE-PULLMAN ER for evaluation and treatment. 



	In the ER, the patient was found to have an engorged AV graft without dopplerable pulse or bruit. The patient was seen by surgery and an ultrasound of the upper extremity revealed a clotted graft and so the patient was admitted to the medical service for further evaluation and treatment.



Of note, the patient denies any pain  / numbness / coolness in his hand. He further denies any shortness of breath, increased swelling in his legs, or changes in his weight. He does indicate that he has suffered from decreased oral intake lately secondary to feeling tired and having a decreased appetite.

Source: Medical record, Patient



Chief Complaint: fistula clot



History of Present Illness:  Pt is a 59 yo Khazakhstani male, with h/o HTN, DM, mucormycosis, and ESRD on HD presenting with a thrombosed AVF in his left arm, established in April of 2064 by Dr. Jordon.  The patient has a history of multiple problems with access (clots, stenoses), requiring frequent thrombectomies and revisions.   The patient first noticed a problem on July 23, and by the 24th he said that ""the access had collapsed."" On July 25, interventional radiology attempted to thrombectomize the clot, with no success, requiring placement of a new tunneled catheter in left IJ to allow dialysis.  At present, patient is on the OR waiting list for tomorrow, for thrombectomy/revision.  



Of note, patient was admitted in April of 2064 after a nurse at the McLaren Hospital detected a new cardiac murmur.  Pt was found to have a RA thrombus by echo, presumed to be a complication from a prior catheter, started on a heparin gtt and transitioned to coumadin.

                                              6-19-59
 
 
 
HPI:  This is a regularly scheduled visit for this Eva Ruledge a 
44-year old woman with a history of hypertension and borderline obesity.  
She was last here in February with no complaints, but did have an elevated 
creatinine for which she was referred to the Internal Medicine for further 
evaluation.  The patient did not, however, present to the Internal Medicine as 
planned.  She states that she has been ""too busy.""  Her only complaint 
today is of some right leg pain, which she says is chronic and which is 
relieved to some extent by acetaminophen.  
 
Eva continues to take Procardia XL 30 mg. PO q.day.  A noted in her 
ambulatory record, the Procardia is prescribed as a b.i.d. drug, however, 
Eva believes it gives her headaches and refuses to take it other than 
on an almost p.r.n. basis.  
 
Review of systems is essentially normal.  Specifically, she denies any 
headaches, any chest pain, any shortness of breath.  She also denies any 
symptoms or signs referable to her urinary tract.  She has no history of 
dysuria, of frequent urinary tract infection, or of hematuria.
 
Physical Examination:  She is robust appearing.  Vital signs are 
significant for a blood pressure of 140/100.  HEENT exam is unremarkable.  
Lungs are clear.  Cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, a normal 
S1, S2.  No S3 is appreciated.  There are no murmurs or rubs.  Abdomen is 
slightly obese, nontender, and with normal bowel sounds.  No masses are 
appreciated.  Lower extremities are without edema and joint exam does not 
suggest effusion or limitation of her range of motion.  Indeed, exam of 
her legs is entirely unremarkable.  
 
Laboratory:  Will include a repeat creatinine, a urinalysis and urine 
sediment and a urine creatinine.
 
Assessment and Plan:
 
1.   Hypertension:  Eva has had persistently elevated blood pressure 
     on her Procardia.  I have asked her to stop taking Procardia, which 
     she blames for headaches and to begin taking taking atenolol, 
     beginning at 50 mg. PO q.day.  I will see her in a few days in order 
     to make sure that she is not having any difficulties with this drug 
     and also to check her blood pressure once again.
 
2.   Right leg pain:  This would appear to be chronic and may well be 
     related to her work, which requires her to scuttle throughout the 
     hospital at fairly high speed (She is a Pulping Control Operator.)  I  have asked her to continue taking 
     Tylenol and we will re-evaluate her need for more powerful agents, 
     such as nonsteroidals if the need arises.

                                              6-19-59
 
 
 
3.   Elevated creatinine:  Unfortunately, Eva has not kept her Renal 
     appointment.  In order to prevent this from recurring a third time, I 
     have called and made an appointment for her with Dr. Eileen Xayavong.  
     She is to see him on the 29th of this month at 1:00 p.m. and I have 
     also left a message on his E mail mentioning Eva to him.  
     Hopefully, he can help ultrasound identify the etiology of this 
     elevated creatinine before there is further loss of her kidney 
     function.  
 
4.   Health Maintenance:  The patient was scheduled to have a Pap smear 
     today, but again was ""too busy to stay that long.""  She is to see me 
     again shortly, and a Pap smear will be done at that time.  Her 
     February mammogram was essentially not suggestive of malignancy and 
     will not be repeated until next year.

                                      PROMPTCAREIMA Clinic Note



Mrs. Rutledge is a former patient of Dr. Xia's who comes in today to establish a new PCP and for follow-up of her hypertension, diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine 2.2), and GERD.  She is currently on procardia xl, losartan, and atenolol for her hypertension.  She takes a baby aspirin qd for cardiac protection.  Her diabetes is controlled by diet alone, and her GERD by zantac 150 qd or bid prn.  Her last HbA1C was 6.9, with a malb/cr ratio of 222.2 and trace protein on U/A.  She has had a prior cardiac work-up for atypical chest pain with a negative ETT/SPECT in 2062 and a negative ETT in 2064.  An echo in 2062 showed an EF of 65% with no valvular abnormalities.



She is currently well with no complaints.  She is being followed in opthalmology for possible glaucoma.  She does not check her blood sugars at home, although she has a glucometer.  When asked if her sugars are ever low, she states that she has the same symptoms with hypoglycemia that she does with hyperglycemia: dizziness and hot flashes.  She's not had this recently.  She also does not check her BP at home.  She denies any numbness or tingling in her fingers, or any chest pain.  She did pull a muscle in her shoulder last night and still feels tender in that area.  She follows a diabetic diet (avoids sweets), gets no regular exercise, but works in Electrical and Avionics Mechanics so does have physical activity during the day.

Ext:  no edema, peripheral pulses present and feet without lesions.



Assessment:  51 yo woman with diabetes, hypertension, CRI from hypertension/diabetic nephropathy likely. 



Current Plan:

1.  Diabetes.  Checking A1C off medication.  Would like to have patient check FS when she's feeling ill or if A1C is elevated.  Will refer to NP for review glucometer use, diabetic diet.  She has been tried on glucotrol XL in the past and was hypoglycemia.  This is also probably not a good choice due to her renal insufficiency.  May try glyburide if A1C elevated.  Being followed by opthalmology with upcoming appt.  Podiatry referral deferred.  Consider repeat referral to nutrition.  Lipids very good (LDL 82) last check off medication.

2.  Hypertension.  BP borderline elevated today, but off atenolol.  HR also up.  Refilled all meds; will ask NP to check her pressure at next visit.  Will continue qd ASA for CAD/stroke prevention.

3.  GERD.  Continue zantac bid as needed.  Also recommended that patient start using Tums for calcium supplementation and relief of intermittent dyspepsia.  She will try this and get back to me about the effect.

4.  Chronic renal insufficiency.  Will get 24-hour urine to assess creatinine clearance and urine protein.  Checking chem 7 today for K and Creatinine.

5.  Health maintenance.  Patient due to dT shot, requested today.  Normal mammogram in 5/66.  Stool guaiac and flex sig can be done at next appt; will follow-up Pap.

Assessment/Plan:

1.	 Seizures-likely in setting of subtherapuetic Dilantin dose-will finish one gram load and start PO dilantin in am at 300 tid per neurology recommendations and check levels and await levels 10-15. Head CT negative for new process and no evidence of other reason for seizure. Patient on Keppra in past-needed now? Will ask neurology

2.	Pyuria-uncertian if significant due to the patient's likely minimal urine output-sent for culture-will await results-continue broad specrtrum coverage of potential pathogens with Vancomycin (1 gram given in ED) and ceftriaxone.

3.	High WBC-Abd CT reportedly negative as was CXR-will check final results and patient without symptoms-blood cultures pending-follow temp curve and WBC and continue abx until cultures negative

4.	Electrolyte abnormalities-patient on hemodialysis-will schedule for am-if not possible will have to treat for hyperkalemia.

5.	Renal transplant-continue Prednisone

6.	CVA-Will continue Aggrenox for now

7.	Other-continue home meds for now except lactobacillus as certain of purpose?

RE: Jacob Rodriquez, M.D.
    MR #863-35-65-5

Dear Dr. Faust: 

Thank you for kindly referring your patient, Jacob Rodriquez, to the
Internal Medicine for evaluation of pulmonary hypertension.
Although I'm sure you are familiar with his history, I will review
it now for our records. Dr. Rodriquez is a 77-year-old retired Electrician
at Wells Fargo who by his report has enjoyed excellent
health until the past year. He denies any prior history of
hypertension, coronary artery disease, chest pains, significant
childhood illnesses or malignancy. He describes his usual baseline
health as excellent. He is a religious walker, walking multiple
times each week as well as a woodwind and singing enthusiast. Dr.
Rodriquez states that in approximately April or Mayof the past year he
was first diagnosed with hyperglycemia. This was treated with
Metformin. Subsequently Hydrochlorothiazide and Zestril were added
apparently for hypertension (although the patient does not believe
he has been diagnosed with hypertension). He subsequently developed
diarrhea which he felt was related to Glucophage which was
subsequently reduced in dose. In June of the past year the patient
was noted to be anemic which was felt to be related to sulfa in his
Hydrochlorothiazide. At that time he also was found to have lower
extremity edema which worsened with the discontinuation of the
Hydrochlorothiazide. The patient states in September of 2119 he
traveled to trinidad and tobago. While in trinidad and tobago he had a
marked increase in his lower extremity edema to the point that he
found it difficult to ambulate. He denied any difficulty with chest
pains or shortness of breath. He had no hemoptysis and no focal
unilateral leg swelling despite the long period of immobility
during the trip. He was seen by a Trinidad physician who prescribed an
ethacrynic acid which reduced his lower extremity edema
significantly. However, he subsequently developed diarrhea to this
medication and it was stopped. Subsequently his lower extremity has
once again worsened and has been treated with increasing doses of
Lasix and with the recent addition of Zaroxolyn. At the present
time Dr. Rodriquez states that he has no overt shortness of breath. He
still able to sing vigorously and to play woodwinds without any

RE: Jacob Rodriquez, M.D. 
January 18, 2120


limitation. He does find ambulating difficult due to the swelling
in his lower extremities. He has no chest pain, has no cough, no
sputum production, no hemoptysis. He has no fevers or chills. He
believes his weight is increased by 35 pounds in the past several
months. He believes this is entirely due to edema accumulation. He
denies any difficulties with disrupted sleep although he does note
that he's becoming increasingly fatigued during the day and is
often napping in the reclining chair which is new for him. He
denies any history of snoring. He has noted no new joint complaints
although he has had a pruritic eruption on the anterior surface of
his right lower extremity as well as on his left arm. This has been
present for approximately two or three months. Other than that he
believes his bowel and bladder function is normal. Review of
systems is otherwise unremarkable. 

His past medical history is significant for:
     1. Type II diabetes as above. 
     2. An apparent diagnosis of labile hypertension noted in his 
        chart. 
     3. Anemia thought secondary to Hydrochlorothiazide. 
     4. Past history of right bundle branch block. He has no      
        history of rheumatic fever. 

Current medications include Atenolol 25mg daily, folic acid,
Glucophage 850mg bid, Lasix 120mg daily, Lisinopril 15mg daily,
compression stockings, Metolazone 2.5mg daily was added recently. 

Drug allergies include possible hemolytic anemia due to
Hydrochlorothiazide. 

Family history is significant for diabetes mellitus. 

Social history is assuming for the fact that the patient is an
immigrant from trinidad and tobago. He has been living in Haleyville
since the early 2059's. He is a Electrician at Wells Fargo. He
has minimal exposure to chemicals in his research towards his
bachelor's degree but none since then. He is a non tobacco user. He
uses alcohol minimally. He's never had any blood transfusions. He
lives with his wife. They have no pets. He does not enjoy any
unusual hobbies not noted above. He has been exposed to
tuberculosis in the past and has a history of a positive PPD. 

On physical examination today Dr. Rodriquez weighs 193 pounds. Blood
pressure is 136/90. Pulse 83 and regular. Respiratory rate is 20.
Temperature is 96.8. Resting oxygen saturation is 98-99% with
ambulation in the hallway. This fell to a minimum of 97% with an
increase in his heart rate to 100. HEENT exam is significant for a
clear oropharynx. Sclera are white. Conjunctiva are minimally pale.

RE: Jacob Rodriquez, M.D. 
January 18, 2120


The thyroid gland is normal. Jugular venous distention to
approximately 10 cm. was noted. Neck was supple. Examination of the
chest revealed diminished breath sounds bilaterally with dullness
at both bases. There was no egophony and no wheezes. Otherwise the
lungs were clear. Cardiac exam with a regular rate in rhythm,
normal S1 and S2, an intermittent S4 was appreciated. No RV heave
or lift was appreciated. No pulmonary artery tap was appreciated.
The pontic component of S2 was moderately enhanced. No appreciable
murmurs were detected. The point of maximum impulse was in the
anterior axillary line. Examination of the abdomen revealed a
nontender abdomen with a palpable liver edge, three fingerbreadths
below the right costal margin. This was nontender and smooth.
Minimal splenomegaly was also appreciated as well. Normal bowel
sounds were present. Examination of the extremities reveal three
plus symmetric edema to the top of the thigh in the lower
extremities, one plus edema was also present in both upper
extremities. No clubbing was noted. There were no skin changes
consistent with collagen vascular disease. Multiple follicular
lesions were noted on the anterior aspect of the right thigh as
well as on the left arm. Neurological exam was grossly nonfocal. 

Objective data include a CBC which most recently demonstrated a
white count of 11.8, hematocrit of 32.1, platelet count of 250.
Differential was not remarkable. LVH is elevated at 599, AST is
most recently 22. A urinalysis on 12/07/19 was negative for
protein. No reportive cast was made. A CEA was notable for a level
of 2.4 on 1/05/20. An echocardiogram obtained on 12/22/19
demonstrated normal LV size with mild concentric LVH and preserved
LV function. The right ventricle was mildly dilated and
hypertrophied with mild reduction in RV function. There was trace
MR with moderate TR. A peak systolic artery pressure of 64 plus
right atrial pressure was noted. 

In summary Dr. Rodriquez is a 77-year-old gentleman with a clear cut
pulmonary hypertension. The etiology of this is not clear at the
moment. Differential diagnosis could include chronic thromboembolic
disease, occult underlying pulmonary disease (doubt), obstructive
sleep apnea, and collagen vascular disease. In addition some
patients develop a marked pulmonary artery hypertension in the
setting of stiff left ventricle even with preserved left
ventricular function although this I think would be a diagnosis of
exclusion. The degree of his edema is quite striking and I agree
with increasing his diuretic regimen. I'm embarking on a course of
evaluation to exclude the most likely causes. In specific he will
be having a CT with IV contrast to rule out chronic thromboembolic
disease this afternoon. This has already been arranged by Dr.
Faust. In addition I'm sending serology including an ANA, an
antidouble stranded DNA and an anti SCL70. I've also asked Dr. Rodriquez
Page 4
Freeman Faust, M.D. 
RE: Jacob Rodriquez, M.D. 
January 18, 2120


to undergo polysonography to exclude obstructive sleep apnea. He
will be following up with our pulmonary function lab to have formal
pulmonary function testing performed in addition to having an
arterial blood gas drawn. If this evaluation should be unrevealing,
he may require more invasive diagnostics. I've already consulted
formally with Dr. Eddie Roy, the physician with most
experience in pulmonary hypertension at this hospital and he would
be able to assist us in the further evaluation of Dr. Rodriquez if our
workup is nondiagnostic.  

Dr. Faust, thank you again for referring Dr. Rodriquez for evaluation.
I'll plan on seeing him in approximately three to four weeks after
his diagnostic tests have been performed. Please do not hesitate to
call me with any further questions or concerns. 

Sincerely, 




Jose Church, M.D.

confirm the resident's detailed note.  Please refer to it.  

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Foot ulcer.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 78-year-old gentleman 

who is a diabetic developed left foot ulcer six weeks ago after he 

had shaving of some calluses by a podiatrist.  The wound has not 

healed and then got infected.  He was started on Keflex, then when 

the initial cultures came back showing resistance to Keflex so he 

was switched to Cipro, however, his final cultures showed MRSA.  He 

comes in with increasing redness and pain.  

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, diabetes, peripheral vascular 

disease, mitral regurgitation, anemia, sleep apnea and pulmonary 

hypertension.   

MEDICATIONS:  Documented on the chart.

ALLERGIES:  Documented on the chart.  

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  He is a Electrician.  He drinks 

alcohol occasionally, he does not smoke.  Family history of kidney 

stones.  

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  He is afebrile, vital signs 

are stable.  GENERAL:  The patient was awake, alert in no distress. 

He does not look toxic.  HEART:  He had a small heart murmur.  

LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  

EXTREMITIES:  He had multiple ulcers on his left foot, stage two or 

three, an ulcer on his heel as well as the distal third and fourth 

toes.  There was some mild surrounding cellulitis.  He had 3+ pedal 

edema.  The casts were symmetric and nontender.  There is no 

adenopathy.  

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The patient had a white count of about 16, 

mildly elevated but no bandemia.  His BUN and creatinine were 50 

and 1.8.  Blood cultures were sent. 

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  He was given a dose of Vancomycin.  

Surgery was consulted.  The primary came and saw the patient as 

well and he was admitted to the hospital.   

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Diabetic foot ulceration with cellulitis, rule

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Marsh is a 73-year-old male who comes for first visit to TRMC to initiate longitudinal care and follow up of multiple medical problems.



PROBLEMS:

1.  Chronic renal failure.  He has been on dialysis for the past four years.  He is currently dialyzed two times per week.  He apparently had been three times per week in the past.

2.  Hyperlipidemia.  Fasting lipid analysis one year ago showed total cholesterol 225, triglycerides 265, LDL 161, and HDL 40.  He has not been treated.

3.  Hyperparathyroidism.  PTH level one year ago was 143.  He is on calcium replacement.

4.  IgG monoclonal gammopathy.  This was noted on immunoelectrophoresis.  It was at very low levels.



MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 81 mg q.d., Nephrocaps one q.d., and PhosLo 2001 mg t.i.d. by his report.



REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  He states he was told he was hypertensive at last dialysis. No significant weight change, febrile signs or symptoms, headache, blurred vision, tinnitus, chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, abdominal pain, nightsweats, diarrhea, skin rash, bruising, joint pain, or focal weakness.  



ALLERGIES:  No known allergies.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient appears well.  Blood pressure on multiple measurements range from 150-160/78-82, weight 144 pounds, and heart rate 72 and regular.  Chest: Clear to percussion and auscultation.  Cardiovascular exam:  No extra sounds or murmurs.  Abdominal exam:  No masses, tenderness, or organomegaly.  Extremities: No edema.  Skin: No rash.  Musculoskeletal exam: Grossly intact.



ASSESSMENT/PLAN:

1.  Chronic renal failure.  The patient will continue on dialysis.  I have requested screening blood tests.

2.  Hyperlipidemia.  This needs to be treated.  I have asked him to return for reestablishment of baseline.

3.  Hyperparathyroidism.  Secondary to chronic renal failure.  He is on calcium replacement.

4.  Low-grade IgG monoclonal gammopathy. Will recheck values and follow.

5.  Hypertension.  A degrees systolic hypertension warrants therapy.  He is due for dialysis tomorrow, however.  I gave him a prescription for atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.

6.  Adult health maintenance.  I gave him a prescription for aspirin, which he should be taking and asked him to return in two weeks for a full annual review.

  I instructed him to show renal staff the prescriptions tomorrow at dialysis.

KEKELA INPATIENT DIALYSIS ADMIT NOTE





NAME: Marsh, Carl

MRN: 99579205



Primary Care MD: Xavier T. Mccoy



Outpatient Nephrologist: Keith Tierney

Outpatient Dialysis Unit:  Sanford Memorial Hospital, S and T

Estimated dry weight: 61 kg

Dialysis access: left AVF



Reason for admission:    body jerking    since last night



HPI: 



74 year old Turkmenistan male with a past medical history of ESRD presumably secondary to HTN presents to the KEKELA ED with complaints of    body jerking    since last night.  The patient was in his otherwise good state of health when he went to his normal dialysis session yesterday.  The session was uneventful, and he finished dialysis around 7:30 pm.  Around 9 pm, he started noting un-controlable jerky movements of his jaw, arms, and legs.  He was unable to stand by himself, and had difficulty with any motor activity.  It was so bad that he was unable to feed himself, and needed help from his wife to do so.  The jerking continued throughout the night without getting better, and his daughter called his PCP's office today, at which time he was instructed to proceed to the KEKELA ED.  He has had a similar episode like this before in January of 2092, when he developed the exact same jerking movements after a long three day weekend when he went without dialysis (see note in LMR by neurology consultant).  It was deemed at that time that his myoclonus was due to    electrolyte disarray,    and he was admitted to EDUCARE-FARGO and received dialysis the same day with complete resolution of symptoms.  He has been symptom-free since that time.



He reports no other new events.  He denies any new medications.



Past Medical History: 



1.)	ESRD secondary to hypertension

ASSESSMENT:



74 year old male who presents with:



1.)	Myoclonus   unclear etiology without obvious precipitants; the last time this happened, it was in the setting of not getting dialyzed after three days.  While he did get dialysis yesterday per his normal schedule, it is odd that his potassium today is 5.5, suggesting perhaps either dietary indiscretion (which he denies) or, perhaps, inadequate dialysis.  In addition, he says that his dialysis center has been taking him off    early    a few times in the past week, though he notes that he got a full run yesterday (3    hours)

2.)	chronic HD

3.)	h/o MGUS   shoulder fat pads



PLAN:



1.)	Admit to Renal Medicine service, Dr. Tierney attending

2.)	Will plan on dialysis tomorrow for two reasons: (1) high potassium, (2) see if this helps with myoclonus

3.)	Will contact dialysis center tomorrow to see if any problems with his runs, and what his most recent URR or Kt/V was

4.)	continue Phos-Lo 2001 tid with meals

5.)	Kayexalate 30 po tonight for elevated potassium



Discussed with Dr. Tierney

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old man male who comes in for follow up of chronic kidney disease and other medical problems.


PROBLEMS:
1.  Chronic renal disease.  He has dialysis twice per week.  He tells me he is on the transplant list.  The transplant team would like a positive CVS treated with levofloxacin
2.  Hyperlipidemia.  Fasting lipid analysis 2 weeks ago showed total cholesterol 255, triglycerides 203, HDL 39, and LDL 175.  He had been taking Crestor but says the bottle emptied and he did not know to refill it.
3.  Secondary hyperparathyroidism.  Recent PTH 829, calcium 10.1, and phosphorus 6.7.
4.  Superficial back pain.  He had an abscess drained overlying the right scapula several months ago.  Since then, he has had some mild pain.


MEDICATIONS:  He did not bring any tonight.  As listed:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg daily.
2.  Nephrocaps 1 daily.
3.  Phoslo 2001 mg t.i.d.


REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  No significant weight change, febrile signs or symptoms, headache, blurred vision, tinnitus, chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, abdominal pain, nightsweats, diarrhea, dysuria, polyuria, bruising, joint pain, or focal weakness.  


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is in no acute distress.  Chest:  Clear to percussion and auscultation.  Skin exam:   There are two small cavities overlying the right scapula  filled with dirt and slight surrounding erythema..  Abdominal exam:  No masses, tenderness or organomegaly.  Extremities:  No edema.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  Chronic kidney disease.  On dialysis.
2.  Hyperlipidemia.  I prescribed Zocor.
3.  Secondary hyperparathyroidism.  I am concerned about bone status.  Bone mineral density exam requested.
4.  Skin changes after abscess drainage.  Area was cleaned and covered.
 The patient has history of elevated total protein and amylase.  Will need follow up.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 61 year old gentleman
here for his first visit to me as his PCP, referred by Dr.
Xavier.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS/PAST MEDICAL HISTORY BY PROBLEMS:
 The patient has no acute complaints today.  His medical
history includes:
1.  Hypertension.  He is currently on hydrochlorothiazide 25
mg q.d. and aspirin q.d.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.  The patient is on 30 mg q.h.s. of
simvastatin.  His last lipid panel in April of this year
showed total cholesterol of 196, triglycerides 169, HDL 52,
and LDL of 110.  He has no LFTs on file.
3.  Psychiatry.  According to the patient, he carried a
diagnosis of major depression with paranoid features.  He is
being followed by Dr. Uhler, psychiatrist at Marshfield Clinic as well as Betty Villasenor, a therapist at Marshfield Clinic.  He is currently on Depakote, Tegretol, Risperdal,
and Paxil although he does not know the doses of his
medications.  He still feels depressed but his paranoid
symptoms have subsided.  He has no manic or hypermanic
episodes.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 325 mg q.d., Paxil, Risperdal,
Tegretol, Depakote doses unknown, simvastatin 30 mg q.h.s.,
HCTZ 20 mg q.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs.
 He quit drinking alcohol 16 years ago.  He has not been
sexually active for 16 years and is currently not
interested.  He lives by himself in  Denver Drive, walks
about 20 minutes per day, and is from Louisa originally.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother and father died of MIs in their 70s.
 There is no history of sudden cardiac death.  No cancer,
liver, kidney, or thyroid disease in the family.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 132/84, heart rate 84,
and weight 202 pounds.  The remainder of the exam is
deferred.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  Hypertension.  The patient is well controlled on his
current regimen.  I will therefore not change anything
today.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.  The patient is at his goal LDL
level.  I will continue to follow his lipid panel yearly.  I
will also check LFTs today, given that he had a statin.
3.  Psychiatry.  The patient will follow up with his
psychiatrist and therapist.  He will let me know his actual
medication and medication doses at his earliest convenience.
 Also, I will recheck an LFT as stated above, given that he
is on possibly hepatotoxic psychoactive medications.
4.  Healthcare maintenance.  I have emphasized to the
patient the benefits of weight reduction as well as
increasing his exercise.  He is not interested in any
exercise as in walking and I have therefore counseled him to
walk longer and faster.  He had a negative flexible
sigmoidoscopy in November 2083 and I will give him stool
cards today.  His last tetanus was 10 years ago and he is
not interested in the booster today.  His immunizations are
otherwise up to date according to him and he will need the
remainder of the history and a full physical exam at the
next visit in 3 months' time.

EDVISIT^37199514^WILKERSON, EDWARD^01/17/93^HODGES, CHAD

Please see the written documentation undertaken by Dr. Caldwell,

the resident who saw the patient primarily.  I have seen and

examined the patient personally, reviewed the written

documentation and agree with the assessment and plan.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Wilkerson is a 68-year-old

gentleman without significant past medical history, who is

actually being seen here by his primary care physician who

happens to be a resident rotating ____ normally sees him in MIMAIMA

Clinic.  According to Dr. Caldwell, his PCP, he generally does

not have very much past medical history, but when he gets

infected, he gets confused.  He presents today with confusion. 

His visiting nurse today noticed that he has been having weakness

and fatigue over the last few days, but today, he was confused as

he has been when he has been ill in the past.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Dementia, SVT, hypertension, and diabetes

type 2.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a former smoker.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Otherwise, negative.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise negative except as previously

dictated.

MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, omeprazole,

Risperdal, Tegretol, verapamil, and Tylenol #3.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is a healthy, well-appearing Caucasian

gentleman who nevertheless is disoriented to time.  He knows

place and name.  His heart rate is 101, respiratory rate is 20,

blood pressure is 121/92, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room

air, and his temperature is 101.5.  He had left lower lobe

crackles in his lung exam.  The remainder of his physical exam

was otherwise normal.  Mucus membranes were moist.  Abdomen was

soft.  Extremities had no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had a normal chest x-ray, negative

urinalysis.  White blood cell count was 7.12.  He had a

creatinine of 1.24, up from his baseline and a lactate of 3.8. 

His chest x-ray showed no acute process.

IMPRESSION:  My impression is that the patient has severe sepsis

by virtue of evidence of change in his mental status and his

creatinine, he was given a liter of normal saline in the

Emergency Department as a bolus.  Given that pneumonia and

urinary tract infection were highest on the list, we decided to

treat him with Rocephin and azithromycin.  He will be admitted to

the Medical Service.

Edward Wilkerson
MRN: 37199514
Please refer to Student Doctor Nicky Li for HPI, ROS and past medical history. 




Briefly, 68 yr old male w a h/o HTN, HL, DMII, peripheral neuropathy, schizoaffective disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder s/p SVT ablation on 4/10 who post-operatively has been confused with gait disturbance. Neurology was consulted for an evaluation of gait disturbance and encephalopathy. On exam patient is normotensive and afebrile with cognition remarkable for inattention, disorientation, perseveration and preservation of speech and visual spatial processing. His physical exam is further remarkable for asterixis and bilateral upper extremity tremulousness. His cranial nerves are intact. His has four limb give way weakness without focality. Reflexes are 3+ and symmetric in the upper extremities and 2+ and symmetric in the lower extremities. Toes are down. Finger to nose is preserved. He is unable to stand without assistance. Differential includes toxic metabolic disturbance (i.e. hyper ammonia in the setting of depakote use vs. drugs of abuse, vs. alcohol withdrawal vs. additional superimposed toxic metabolic disturbance)




Recommendations:

-please check Liver function panel

-check ammonia

-Check B12, folate, RPR, TSH

-please start multivitamin and thiamine 100mg daily
-please check carbamazepine and valproic acid levels; please verify carbamazepine dosing as prior records suggest 400mg QD and patient is on BID dosing

-serum and urine toxicology screen

-obtain collateral history regarding possible alcohol abuse and monitor for alcohol withdrawal

-would hold amitriptyline given anticholinergic properties

-if above workup negative and unrevealing would consider NCHCT but defer imaging at this time

Chest: Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to prior exam dated 5/31/2072 and show mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and an atherosclerotic aorta. There are small bilateral posterior pleural effusions. Adjacent parenchymal opacity may reflect atelectasis or early pneumonia in theappropriate clinical setting. Mild diffuse elevation of        the interstitium appears chronic. Right upper lobe granuloma.
      
     IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly with small bilateral posterior
     pleural effusions. Adjacent parenchymal opacity could reflect
     subsegmental atelectasis or early pneumonia in the appropriate
     clinical setting. These findings were communicated by me to Dr.
     Ximena Webber at 2:25 p.m
         
A/P:  63M with known CRRTx since 2060 with known CKD and baseline Cr 2.5 with urethral stricture and in-dwelling Foley. Pt. now with fevers, UTI, and diarrhea.  He will be admitted to George Rutledge, M.D. on the Internal Medicine.

Chief Complaint

L post-auricular pain



History of Present Illness

Developed mild pain in L ear and postauricular area the last two weeks.  No trauma, no hearing loss, no vertigo, no URI symptoms



Problems

      Hypertension

Tolerating Zestril without problems. BP still elevated on Zestril 20mg.

      Obesity

She was started on Xenical by Internal Medicine.  She is taking it only Qd instead of AC, since it is giving her too much loose stool.  She feels increase flatulence, bloating sensation on Xenical.

      Depression

Stable on Prozac.  No adverse side effects.  No SI or HI.

      Knee pain

from medial meniscal tear.  No edema, erythema. Celebrex effective initially but now not.  She is taking on top of Celebrex also Motrin.  She is going for return visit with Dr. Vogel to discuss surgery.

      Anemia

Fe studies, vitamin B12, folate levels all normal. Asymptomatic without CP, SOB, or lightheadedness.  No abnormal vaginal bleeding.



Medications

      Zestril (LISINOPRIL)    20MG,  1 Tablet(s)  PO QD

Assessment and Plan

Summary: 50yoF with obesity, knee pain, hypertension



1)  hypertension: tolering Zestril. K and Cr are fine. Will increase Zestril to 40mg QD.  Patient also given a prescription for Hctz 12.5mg QD but told not to start it yet until his next BP check and start only if BP > 140/85.



2)  L knee pain: Celebrex not effective anymore. Patient told to stop and continue Ibuprofen 800mg TID with meals.  Patient will see Dr. Vogel and discuss surgery.  No benefit from PT.



3)  obesity:  taking only Xenical once a day. No significant weight change yet, but recently just started on Xenical.  Will follow.

ADMISSION NOTE



CC/ID: 51 yo F with no known h/o CHF or CAD, but with multiple cardiac risk factors, p/w dyspnea



HPI: Pt has had difficulty with bp ctrl due to poor med compliance (SBP 160-190 in clinic). Had been on Atenolol and Zestril but pt self-D/C'd Zestril several wks ago because she thought the Zestril made her feel nauseated. Since then, has had gradually developing DOE   from baseline of walking over 4-5 flights of stairs without difficulty to dyspnea on only a flight of stairs. She underwent L knee arthroscopy for medial meniscal tear on 11/19/78 without immediate complications. At 3 am that night, though, woke up with severe dyspnea, with some relief upon sitting up. Associated with some wheezing; tried some of husband's nebs   only slight relief. Later over the day, dyspnea worsened to the point that only few steps would make short of breath. Some association with non-radiating substernal chest tightness in evening; no N/V, lightheadness, diaphoresis, or pleuritic CP, F/S/C, or cough. Next day, dyspnea persisted so pt came into ED.



In ED, found to have BP of 230's/120's, satting 70's on RA. CTA PE-protocol showing no PE or DVT but with pulm edema and bibasilar atelectasis vs. PNA (unlikely). Given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1    2.7 L diuresis; started on nitropaste, Captopril, Labetalol    BP down to 140's. Also given ASA and Lopressor x 1 and started on Heparin IV. Given Levoflox x 1 for ? PNA on CXR. Had to be on BiPAP for several hrs   transitioned to 3L NC, satting mid-90's. Transferred to floor for further mgmt.



Has had recent 8/78 ECHO   EF 67% with mild MR, TR, and AI; nl LV size and function without WMA.





ROS:

-Has had mild R subscapular dull pain on night before admission; not associated with her chest tightness or dyspnea; resolved on own on day of admission.

-Pt thinks L leg may be more swollen than her R

CXR: pulm edema 



A/P

51 yo F with no known CAD or CHF, p/w acute CHF in setting of severe HTN, c/b troponin leak



1.CARDS:  Suspect that pt had flash pulm edema from HTN due to poor med compliance as well as from  fluid re-mobilization post-surgery. Acute ischemic event possible given some EKG changes as well as mildly elevated troponin, but these findings could be also explained as demand ischemia event.



-Serial EKG's

-Cardiac monitor, telemetry

-Troponin elevation likely due to demand ischemia; subsequent level was lower, indicating resolving. Doubt ACS at this time but will continue to follow enz's

-ASA, Lopressor

-BP ctrl with ACE-I & B-blocker, aiming for SBP goal of 140's-160's for overnight  (BP had been as high as 230's)

-Lipitor; Check fasting lipids & glucose, homocysteine

-Lasix as needed, aiming for TBB goal of neg 1-2 L; Strict I/O's, qd wt's

-ECHO and Adenosine-MIBI (when more stable)

 

2. Leg Edema: Doubt DVT, but given recent surgery and lack of mobility, will check LENI's

-Fragmin for DVT prophylaxis

-F/U LENI's



3. Miscellaneous:

  	Nexium

  	MVI, Folate, Thiamine

  	PT consult

  	Nutrition consult



4. Anemia

-Guaiac all stools; Bid Hct's for now

-Check iron studies, hemolysis labs, peripheral smear, retic count

Microbiology:

NA



Radiology:

CXRAY:

Interstitial pulmonary edema, improved from the previous

examination.



EKG: Resolution of the previously Nov-2078 present ST Elevations in V1-V2; LVH

	

Assessment/Plan:

 51 yo F with hx of diastolc dysfunction and recent admission with flash pul edema in the setting of elevated BP, p/w similar symptoms, i.e. acute CHF in setting of severe HTN, no troponin leak, no new ischemic EKG changes



1.CARDS

-Serial EKG's

-Cardiac monitor, telemetry

- Serial Markers

-ASA, Lopressor

-BP ctrl with ACE-I & B-blocker, aiming for SBP goal of 140's-160's for overnight  (BP had been as high as 220's)

-Lipitor; Check fasting lipids   

-Lasix as needed; Strict I/O's, qd wt's

-No need for ECHO or Adenosine-MIBI on this admission given no new EKG changes 

 

2. HTN:

- seems to be well controlled at this time

- if becomes difficult to control will titrate BB up and consider affing another agent 

- may need to be worked up for 2/2 cause of HTN, such as RAS



3. Hx of med noncompliance:  

- will need repetitive reinforcement re importance of adherence to medical regimen

- will discuss potential benefit from being plugged into the CHF clinic

- consider nutrition consult

 

4. Anemia

-Guaiac all stools; 

- Resend iron studies, peripheral smear, retic count, folic acid, B12

- Consider transfusing idf HCT < 30



5. FEN: Low Sodium, Low Cholesterol, Low Fat Diet; Replete lytes as needed



6. Prophylaxis: 

Nexium

IORIO, Olivia (9290228)



OFFICE VISIT:  10/14/84



This 28-year-old young woman, status post two failed renal transplants, re-presents for evaluation.  She is less depressed, more upbeat.  Now a year since her father's death (? drug overdose).



She is on tapering prednisone after her severe rejection for noncompliance. She has multiple access problems, history of seizures, and severe hyperparathyroidism.  



Medications:  Her meds include Prednisone 2 mg in the a.m., Nephrocaps, Prilosec 20 q.d., Midodrine 5 mg only before dialysis, Diltanin 400 mg b.i.d., Tegretol 250 b.i.d., Renagel 4 caps at breafast, lunch, dinner, 3 capsules with snacks plus 2 tablespoons Alternagel, Doxepin 50 q.h.s., Coumadin 5 mg, Xanax 4-5 tablets of 0.5 q.d., Celexa 20.



Allergies:  She has allergies to Cipro, Demerol, penicillin, and gets red man syndrome from Vanco if given rapidly.  



She has seasonal allergies and takes Zyrtec 10 mg, Flonase 2 sprays each nostril, Albuterol 2 puffs 4x a day as needed, and Advair 2 puffs as needed.



Social History:  She is taking 1 course at computer school.



Physical Examination: Her blood pressure was 170/90 - this is much higher for her.  She has conjunctival injection, which is her acute red eye of uremia.  Neck is supple.  Carotid upstroke is normal.  Thyroid is not enlarged.  Chest is clear. She is chronically ill appearing.  She has an S4, no S3.  Abdomen is soft, nontender.  Bowel sounds are normal.  She has a graft in her leg.  She as 1+ to 2+ edema. She has been gaining 4 kg in the interdialytic period.



Impression:  Blood pressure is up.  Hold the Midodrine, readjust her dry weight.  She claims it is 45 kg, I think it may be lower.  May need antihypertensives if blood pressure remains elevated. Reinforced the need for calcium/phosphorus management. She will be seeing Dr. Ebert.","Record date: 2085-04-26

SOCIAL HISTORY:former Construction Worker, lives with mother



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: blood pressure is 130/70, pulse 90 and regular.

     Fundi not well visualized. periorbital edema, conjunctival injection, neck was supple, 

     carotid upstroke normal chest clear to auscultation and percussion, S4 no S3 gallop or rub,

     Abdomen, soft, nontender. Bowel sounds are normal. Extremity 

     1+ edema. 

     

IMPRESSION: end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, seizure

     disorder thrombosed A-V fistula, volume overload.



HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent revision of her left upper arm A-V fistulae by Dr. Schmitt

On 8/30/86 without complications. Because her arm was swollen her subsequent dialysis was done 

Utilizing a temporary femoral dialysis catheter. She was noted to be persistently anemic with a 

Hematocrit of 23.3% on 9/05/86. It was felt that her low hematocrit was due to both blood loss from

Persistent severe menorrhagia as well as a dilutional component from fluid overload. She was electively 

transfused 2 units of packed cells on 9/05/86 while on dialysis utilizing her revised A-V fistulae. 

The rest of her hospital course was uneventful. She was hyperphosphatemic in hospital and was given dietary counseling for use of her phosphate binders. She was discharged home with recommendations for a GYN

Follow-up to assess her persistent mennorhagia and for f/u with her vascular surgeon Dr. Schmitt. She will continue 3x/week dialysis in her Educare-Pullman outpatient unit.

ID/CC  30 year old with ESRD/HD with facial swelling 

HPI:     This patient presented to the ED with a 1 day h/o facial swelling.  She also reports diffuse abdominal pain x several days; as well as chills at dialysis on Wednesday.  She   s attended all dialysis sessions recently for her full time; she has had two infiltrations that resulted in early removal from the HD machine, but she made up her time on other days.  She feels she has been becoming increasingly volume overloaded for the last 1-2 weeks; she has requested an additional (4th) HD session each week but her OP center has not been able to accommodate her.

CXR:      Patchy opacity at the medial right lung base which may be related
	to atelectasis or pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.
	There is a graft like material in the midline that is unchanged in the previous study 
             and may represent an SVC stent.

Impression
Facial swelling, r/o SVC syndrome
  -It is unclear if the stenosis in the brachiocephalic vein explains the facial swelling. 
  -D/w Dr. Asher, intervention nephrology: thrombosis of another vein not seen at fistulogram might explain symptoms 
  -Infection may be contributing to presentation     she had chills at HD and low grade temp in ED
Pulmonary Infiltrate
ESRD/HD
S/p two failed RTx
Anemia 
Seizure d/o 


Recommendations
IV Abx to cover abdomen, lung, possible intravascular infection
  -Vancomycin 750 mg in HD
  -Suggest Aztreonam or alternative in this PCN/Quinolone allergic patient 
CT Angiogram
Blood cultures - will send from HD 
We will check full set of chemistries in HD
She was not therapeutic on her coumadin and appears to need a higher dose

32 yo WF w/ h/o 2 prior failed kidney transplants and now w/  a functioning DDKT placed on 6/16/89, a h/o SVC syndrome requiring angioplasty and declotting and HTN presents w/ acute onset of SOB. 
She says she has had LE edema X one month  that started in the RLE and then became bilateral.  She was started on lasix 20 mg po qd.  The swelling has not resolved. She then describes abdominal fullness/bloating yesterday and sudden onset of SOB last night while getting ready to go to bed.  When she woke up earlier today she still felt SOB and came to the ED.  She denies PND or orthopnea.  She denies chest pain.  Her initial vitals were T 98.6, BP 156/86, HR 97, 99% RA.  She says her BP&#8217;s at home were in a decent range (140&#8217;s) but didn&#8217;t measure her BP since the onset of her SOB.

A/P)
SOB: 
Very high pulm pressures with dilated pulmonary arteries especially in comparison to prior echos in the setting of sudden onset SOB and LE edema in a patient who is sedentary and has had thrombotic events in the past makes PE a likely possibility.  Her poorly controlled HTN, LE edema and rales 
make flash pulmonary edema another consideration.  
Despite her lack of a significant smoking history she had emphasematous changes on prior chest CT scans 
and so could be at risk for a COPD exacerbation but she had good air movement w/o wheezes.  Her face appears slightly swollen and she has had SVC syndrome in the past but her facial swelling is likely related to her steroids, she has only mild venous distention on her chest and she claims her fascial swelling is not worse then usual.
&#224;Agree w/ lasix 60 mg iv BID (but pt may be preload dependent w/ such severe pulm htn so we have to avoid volume depleting her)
&#224;V/Q scan and LE dopplers
&#224;If no PE and not better w/ lasix then will need to consider chest CT w/ IV contrast to r/o SVC syndrome and parechymal lund problems.
&#224;When pt feeling better I would check full PFTS to evaluate pulm htn and possibility of COPD.  I would also screen her for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency given the emphysematous changes on prior CT.


RENAL TX:  Cr only mildly above baseline.  Hopefully won&#8217;t worsen w/ lasix.
&#224;check prograf trough
&#224;continue prograf, cellcept, prednisone at usual doses
&#224;given LE edema check uprot/ucr ratio


HTN:  Poorly controlled.  It&#8217;s partly worsenend by her anxiety.
&#224;ativan 0.5 mg iv q 8 hrs prn anxiety
&#224;Labetolol 20 mg IV and start labetolol 100 mg po bid (bblocker effect will slow HR and help flash pulm edema from diastolic dyfct, the combined alpha and beta blockade will give it added efficacy given the severity of her HTN, Norvasc may not be ideal given her LE edema).


???DM:  pt on metformin for &#8220;diabetes prevention.&#8221;  Metformin is contraindicated for Cr greater then or equal to 1.4 in a female pt.
&#224;d/c metformin


H/O METABOLIC ACIDOSIS:  Pt on chronic bicarb likely to her baseline mild allograft dysfct.  This can be a sodium load that can worsen her pulm edema.

Attending MD Notes

I have examined the patient and discussed with the Nurse Practitioner the patient's care and agree with the plan.  Pt had episode of delerious speaking (full sentences, non-focal otherwise and was able to take a walk to calm down, has had similar before) and this self-resolved.  In ED, charming and without sx.  However, noted BP elevated.  Exam normal.  Plan:  obs o/n, reduce BP, and have patient f/u Monday for recheck to ensure it is not getting up again.

CC: hypotension/unresponsiveness, cough


HPI: Mr. Jacks is an Indonesian 83M w/ HTN, dementia, OA and severe central canal stenosis (recent RCH admission 1/23 - 2/03/50 for associated LUE weakness), significant smoking history, RUL nodule (since &#8217;42), and h/o bronchiectasis, who presents from his nursing home w/ reported episode of hypotension and unresponsiveness on 2/08 around lunchtime.  Per notes, the pt was found to be unresponsive briefly after lunch, BP was checked and found to be in the 80&#8217;s systolic, EMS was activated and an IV was placed.  He quickly became responsive without intervention, and BP came up to the 80s/90s.  Per notes, no reported CP, abdominal pain, HA, LH, focal neurological symptoms, SOB, palpitations.  Of note, the pt was recently hospitalized at RCH 1/23 &#8211; 2/03/50 during which time he had labile BP&#8217;s including HTN as well as question of orthostasis, and was discharged on Hydralazine, HCTZ, Lisinopril, and Labetalol, after having taken only Atenolol and Terazosin on admission.  At rehab on 2/05 (3days PTA), his meds were changed to Atenolol, Terazosin, HCTZ, and Lisinopril.


In the ED, the pt&#8217;s vitals were T 96.4, HR 63, BP 98/53, RR 20, 95% on RA.  Labs sig for Na 129 (up to 131 after NS), Cr 1.58 (baseline 1.0 to 1.1 but recently 1.4 to 1.6), WBC 9.2 up to 15.6 (83% PMN) during time in the ED, Hct from 38.3 to 32.6 (MCV 85) in ED after fluids (guaiac negative), Head CT negative, CXR w/ slightly more prominent bibasilar L &gt; R opacities.  He also c/o cough while in the ED, w/ no other symptoms, w/ report of some rhonchorous breath sounds.  Two sets of blood cultures were drawn, he was given IVF (NS) at 120cc/hr, and he started on Vancomycin and Cefepime for presumed PNA.


On the floor, the pt complains of cough, mildly productive, but no fevers/chills, SOB, DOE, CP, hemoptysis, or any other sx, but is somewhat of a poor historian.  Of note, pt had recent chest CT (I+) on 1/27/50 to evaluate known RUL nodule, which showed likely aspiration PNA w/ multifocal dependent consolidation.  Pt initially was given 2days of Levofloxacin, but per Discharge Summary pt was not clinically behaving as if he had PNA, so Abx were stopped.


PMH / PSH:
-HTN (recent med adjustments as above)
-Osteoarthritis w/ severe central canal stenosis, recent admission 1/50 w/ LUE weakness/ataxia, followed by NSG/Neuro, currently working w/ PT, in neck collar currently

     New small left pleural effusion.
     
     Enlarged prevascular lymph node and increase in size of
     prevascular lymph nodes.
     
     Central left peribronchial thickening, most likely represent
     secretions and/or reactive lymphoid tissues.  Follow-up chest CT
     in six weeks for resolution.

     Thyroid nodule.




EKG:  NSR at 75bpm, Q&#8217;s in III and AVF, left axis
___________________________________________________________________________


Impression/Plan:


83M w/ HTN, dementia, OA and central canal stenosis, smoking history, stable RUL nodule, h/o bronchiectasis, recent imaging suggestive of aspiration PNA, and recent BP med changes, who presents w/ hypotension and brief unresponsiveness at rehab per note.  Here w/ WBC elevation, cough mildly productive, no fevers/chills/myalgias or concern for influenza, but concern for PNA, especially aspiration PNA given prior CT findings, CXR w/ increased L opacity.  Will need to exonerate urine and blood as well; no meningismus on exam.  In terms of the hypotensive episode, likely in setting of mild hypovolemia plus several new BP meds from recent discharge, plus further titration at rehab in preceding few days.  Mildly dry on exam, w/ likely hypovolemic hypoNa but will follow. Hct drop since arrival, will re-check, possibly dilutional, guaiac negative.


** Infection / PNA
--obtain sputum sample
--Vanco and Cefepime given cough and WBC elev, presumed HAP (possibly aspiration)
--obtain U/A since none obtained in ED
--f/u blood ctx x 2


** Hypotension on arrival
--infectious workup / treatment as above
--will only give Labetalol and Hydralazine for now (holding ACEi, HCTZ given mild renal failure above prior baseline), add back Terazosin as necessary
--gentle IVF overnight, re-check a.m. lytes (likely mild hypovolemic hyponatremia) and orthostatics after volume challenge


** Anemia
--guaiac negative in ED, will guaiac all stools, type and cross
--f/u rpt Hct, consider iron studies, retic, etc.


** Renal failure
--at same Cr as last week&#8217;s admission, but up from his baseline; BUN/Cr ratio appears c/w pre-renal picture, will check urine lytes, assess response to IVF


** FEN
--Regular no salt added diet w/ Aspiration precautions; gentle IVF as above
--S+S consult


** Ppx / Other
--heparin sc, PPI, bowel regimen
--Full code for now, re-assess w/ son tomorrow

Team 4 admission note


Admission Date/Time: June 26, 2152 at 7:30PM
Patient Name: Yasseen Jacks
MRN#: 8841350
Attending: Uriel Mays MD
Code status: DNR/DNI per discussion with son
Historian: medical record, patient's son Ursula Jacks


Chief Complaint: agitation


HPI: 
Mr. Jacks is an Indonesian-speaking 85M with a history of dementia, lung nodule, CHF who presents with progressively worsening agitation at home.  As patient is currently very somnolent this history is based on phone interview with Ursula Jacks who is the HCP and is very involved with his father's care.  The patient was diagnosed with dementia by his PCP about 3 years ago and has been relatively stable living at home (on 2nd floor) in Keystone Heights with his wife who has been his primary caretaker; their two sons are very involved as well.  Over the last 6 months they have noticed increasing confusion, agitation, and labile emotions.  They noted he has been confused about location, time (recalls distant past but not recent past), and has occasionally not been able to identify his wife.  He has become emotionally labile and sometimes agitated.  His son notes that he recently had to physically force him to sit down and take his medications.  His wife has had to stay up at night to watch the patient to make sure he did not wander.  They are particularly worried about his ability to take the flight of stairs to their home since it takes him about 15 min to get up and appears unsteady. About 1 wk ago, while his wife was out of their home, he wandered out and locked himself out; when she returned he angrily accused her of locking him out.  Their mother has had increasing difficulty caring for him and has called the 2 sons for help daily for the past week.  They called his PCP about these accelerating changes and he was started on lorazepam 0.5-1mg Q4h prn which brought mild improvement.  Out of concern for his father's and mother's safety they brought him to the ED for evaluation and placement which their PCP has already begun to discuss with them.


They have not noticed fever/chills, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea/constipation (on aggressive regimen), complaints of pain, vision changes.  They have noticed recent urinary incontinence in the last few days.  


In the ED:  VS were T: 98.2    P: 71    BP: 169/84    RR: 18    SaO2: 93% RA.  Exam was notable only for rales bilaterally and mild-moderate agitation. CXR was normal. CBC was at baseline.  UA pending. CT brain could not be performed due to agitation.  They spoke to his PCP who felt this was all due to progression of his dementia.  He was given ativan 2mg IV (total) and haldol 5mg IV (total).  Also got labetalol PO 200mg PO x 1.  




Past Medical History: 


Diabetes mellitus (adult onset): diet-controlled. 

Hyperlipidemia

Thyroid nodule: stable for years, on methimazole

Anemia

Benign essential hypertension

Congestive heart failure

Dementia

Lung Nodule: increase in size of lung nodule when CT repeated in Feb (suspicious for BAC) Son Ursula spoke to Dr. Daniel (per son's report) and they discussed observing and not being aggressive with surgery etc as even though it could be cancer, an invasive operation, considering his multiple other problems, could be much worse for him than simple observation. They have an appt with Dr. Daniel in September.

IDENTIFICATION:  This 65-year-old man with a 5-year history of cardiomyopathy is is admitted with worsening heart failure and recent presyncope for further evaluation.  He was diagnosed with progressive shortness of breath in 2078.  He was treated with diuretics and other medications at that time.  He did quite well until December of last year when he had a cardiac arrest and underwent ICD placement.  He has had worsening symptoms over the last year with increasing shortness of breath on flat ground and a very severe shortness of breath with stairs.  He has had some episodic nature to this.  Two days prior to admission, he had relatively rapid onset of shortness of breath while trying to play pool.  This recurred several times associated with diaphoresis.  He had no palpitations at that time.  He has no chest discomfort.

His past medical history is significant for history of shower emboli and TIA in 2081.  He has diabetes.  He had spinal stenosis surgery in 2078.

His current medical regimen is Bumex 3, recently decreased from 12 due to worsening renal function.  He is on spironolactone described as 6.25 daily, digoxin 0.125, Toprol-XL 12.5.  He has been on carvedilol, which was changed due to dizziness.  He is on lisinopril 1.25 mg and has had great difficulty tolerating any higher dose due to dizziness.  He is on metolazone 2.5 weekly.  He takes Coumadin 7.5 mg most days.  He is on insulin and Lantus.  He has no known drug allergies.

His family history is essentially unremarkable.  Mother unknown, father had onset of angina in his 80s.  The patient lives with his wife and son and is a retired Fire Chief.  He had an 80-pack-year smoking history but quit four years ago.  He has one glass of alcohol every 1-2 weeks.

Review of systems is negative for any problems with fevers, chills, change in his bowel or bladder habits.  He has no problems with swallowing.  He has no problems with hearing or vision.  Review of systems is otherwise negative.

On physical examination, blood pressure is 84/66 in the left arm and 86/62 in the right arm.  His chest is completely clear to auscultation and percussion.  Temperature is 35.9.  His heart rate is 100 and a regular rhythm.  His cardiac exam reveals left ventricular heave, which is visible.  He has a palpable and audible third heart sound.  The right ventricular impulse is present also.  He has a systolic murmur, which is heard everywhere, not otherwise easy to characterize.  It does not change with respiration.  The second component of the second sound is slightly increased in radiation consistent with a PA systolic pressure in the range of 50-60.  His legs are cool.  Venous pattern is very prominent.  His pulses are intact peripherally.  He has no abdominal bruits.  His jugular venous pressure is 14 cm.  He has no cervical adenopathy or thyromegaly.  His liver percusses at approximately 5 cm below the costal margin.  He has some increased resonance around the umbilicus.  Laterally, there is suggestion of some fluid in the distention.  There is no peripheral edema.  His joints are without obvious deformities, although he describes arthritis in his shoulder, neck, and back.  He has no skin rashes or sores, several very small ecchymoses.  His standing blood pressure is unchanged.  He has atrially triggered ventricular pacing at 98.

ASSESSMENT:
1.  Etiology of left ventricular dysfunction is undetermined.  We do not know information of recent catheterization or echocardiography.  The degree of his mitral disease is not clear.  He clearly did not have coronary artery disease on one studied initially.  However, the episodicity is significant.
2.  Current hemodynamic status shows marked volume overload and low cardiac output, and is cold and wet pattern.  His history of recent diuretic use suggests that he may have had relatively rapid onset of fluid after his last diuretic change.  However, the episode while playing pool also raises the possibility of a ventricular tachyarrhythmia undetected.  It is also possible that this is related to angina.
3.  Other related risks.  He is on Coumadin due to his embolic shower before.  It is possible that he has had other emboli, possibly even to coronary arteries leading to recent decline in function.

There are no obvious contraindications to transplant.  At this time, we are not planning to evaluate him but to treat the urgency of his heart failure decompensation.  Our plan is to hold his beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for now, and to begin him on an IV diuretic infusion.  We will proceed with echocardiogram and catheterization if necessary to determine whether there are other conditions exacerbating his current decompensated state.

Lantus and Novolog Insulin Guidelines	



1.	Check blood sugars before meals and at bedtime.  In addition, some meals you may want to check your blood sugar (blood glucose or BG) 1 hour after taking your Novolog.  If it is over 150 you may need to take more Novolog with meals or decrease your carbohydrate intake.  You do not have to do this at every meal and you can alternate meals and/or days.  For example: Sat check before and after breakfast; Friday - lunch; Thursday - supper,etc.

2.	Be careful of the amount of carbohydrates (breads, pasta, cereal, fruit, etc) you eat at each meal and between meals.  Try to average about 60 gms. per meal and 15 gms.  for snacks.

3.	The goal for your blood sugars when you get up in the morning and before meals  is 80-110, 1 hour after taking Novolog (at the start of the meal) it is less than 140, and at bedtime 100 to 140.

4.	Your insulin may need adjusting several times before those goals can be met. When exercising you may need more carbs or less Novolog with meals.  



Long-acting insulin:  Lantus (insulin glargine)

           Take _14_ units at bedtime.  

           Do not mix with any other insulin.  Lantus starts to work in about 1 hr and lasts about 

                24 hours.  It has no peak.

           If your fasting blood sugar for two or more mornings is more than 120, increase your

                Lantus by 2 units at the next dose.  If it is more than 140 for two mornings then     

                increase by 4 units at the next dose.  

            If your fasting blood sugar is less than 70 then decrease your next dose of Lantus 

                 by 2 to 4 units.



Short-acting insulin:  Novolog  

Take 16 units of novolog with breakfast, 6 units with lunch, and 10 units with supper 

   (called  ""standing dose"") within 15 minutes of starting eat your meals. Do not take 

   standing dose if not eating.

Novolog starts to work in 15 minutes and lasts about 2 hours. It peaks in about 1 hour.  

You need to eat enough carbs to cover this insulin or you will have a low blood sugar.  

If blood sugar is < 80 take    your standing dose or sliding scale.  If < 60 do not take standing 

     dose.

Take  Novolog sliding scale (below) in addition to standing dose Novolog at mealtime 

If Blood sugar is   125 - 150 take  2 units more

                             150 - 200 take 3 units more 

                                         201 - 250 take 4 units more  	

                                         251 - 300 take 6 units more  

 			     301 - 350 take 8  units more 

	 >351 take 10 units more and call MD if blood sugar has not 

          decreased or has increased after 2 hours.



Bedtime High Blood Sugar:  If your blood sugar at bedtime is greater than 200 take Novolog by the sliding scale below in addition to Lantus. Do not mix the two insulins.  Do not take standing dose insulin at bedtime. Have your blood sugar checked 1 to 2 hours after taking novolog at bedtime to make sure you haven't gone too low.  If you are below 80 then have a snack and juice to hold you over until morning.

                                  If bedtime blood sugar is 201 - 250 take 2 units

                                                                          251 - 300 take 3 units

                                                                          301 - 350 take 4 units







Please follow up with your endocrinologist or primary care practitioner in 1-2 weeks.  Bring this paper and your blood sugar results from the time you were discharged.  For urgent problems or questions about your blood sugar or insulin call 387-8267 and ask for the page operator.  Have beeper #68537 paged (the diabetes specialist on-call will call you back if you leave a message). You may also try my pager anytime (30568) but I am not always available.

On exam, he looks great.  His blood pressure is 166/98 initially, 148/82 on repeat.  His heart rate is 110.  He weighs 163 pounds.  His head and neck examination is unremarkable.  His venous pressures are less than 7 cm of water.  The lungs are clear.  The cardiac exam reveals a tachycardic rhythm with no rub, murmur or gallop.  The abdomen is unremarkable.  His numerous surgical wounds are well healed.  His extremities are warm without edema.

Electrocardiography is notable for sinus tachycardia at 108 beats per minute, some nonspecific ST changes.  He underwent right heart catheterization and biopsy today.  His right atrial pressure was 5.  His wedge pressure was 17.  His PA pressures were 40/20 with a mean of 30.  The biopsy results are pending at the time of this dictation.

In summary, the patient is doing well now six weeks after cardiac transplantation.  We will be making changes to his immunosuppressive regimen as dictated by the results of his blood work and biopsy.  It is very gratifying to see how well he is doing.  We will be sure to update you on a regular basis.

Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Naranjo:


We saw Anthony Vigil in the Internal Medicine at the Dixmont State Hospital on 03/09/2087.  He underwent orthotopic heart transplant at the Dixmont State Hospital on 03/30/2084 and returns now for his annual evaluation.  In the interval since last seen, he has done reasonably well.  His last annual evaluation at Lorain Community Hospital revealed an ejection fraction of 55% by echocardiography and no coronary disease, although left anterior descending was tortuous.  Filling pressures were normal, then with a wedge of 15 and a right atrial pressure of 9 while the pulmonary artery pressure was 30/19 with a mean of 25.  The patient does have a herniated disk at L4 and stenosis at L5.  He has lower extremity cramps, which potentially due to his spine disease have been markedly exacerbated by Pravachol.  The Pravachol was therefore stopped, restarted, and stopped again.  He continues to take insulin and his last hemoglobin A1c was 6.6.  He has had two recent episodes of mild hypoglycemia.  He has had no dermatologic evaluation.  He denies angina, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmias.


Physical Examination:  Reveals a weight of 183 pounds, blood pressure of 121/71, pulse of 100.  Jugular venous pressure is 8 cm of water.  Carotid upstrokes are brisk without bruits.  There are diminished breath sounds in the left lung.  Point of maximum impulse is not displaced.  First heart sound is normal, second crisp and clear.  He has an S4 at the left sternal border.  The abdomen is without hepatosplenomegaly.  There is no peripheral edema.  Peripheral pulses are diminished.


The electrocardiogram reveals a right bundle-branch block pattern with an intrinsic rate of 98 beats per minute.  There are nonspecific T-wave changes particularly in the early precordium.


Current Medications:  Calcium with D 1250 mg twice per day, Cardura 4 mg, CellCept 1000 mg twice per day, diltiazem CD 240 mg twice per day, Ecotrin 81 mg per day, Lantus insulin 26 units at night, magnesium oxide 400 mg twice per day, vitamin, cyclosporine 100 mg twice per day, Neurontin 100 mg twice per day, NovoLog insulin as needed, prednisone 5 mg per day, vitamins C 500 mg twice per day, and vitamin E 400 units twice per day.


Impression:  The patient will undergo his annual evaluation over the next 24 hours.  This will include blood work, chest x-ray, echocardiogram, metabolic exercise stress test, cardiac catheterization, coronary angiography, and endomyocardial biopsy.  We will see him after completion of these studies and review the results with him.  We will transmit the results to you as well at that time.


Sincerely,

Mr. Sparks is a 74 yr. M who was seen by me as a new patient in Nov. 10 and again in Dec. 10. He RTC.



HPI: This visit was supposed to be a preoperative visit prior to his scheduled Feb. 02 right inguinal hernia repair with Dr. Yamaguchi. However, when I saw him in Dec he had inadequate BP control despite Dr. Arias doubling his Lisinopril. I DCed Atenolol and switched him to Labetalol 100 mg BID. Despite some confusion I believe he has done this. He had also been switched from Crestor to Lipitor due to safety concerns. Labs done pre-operatively are notable for:

Creatinine     3.4

Plan:

1. Hypertension: continues to be inadequate in a diabetic.We have limited options; increasing Lisinopril did not add much. Switch to Labetalol did not help, but he is also not beta-blocked (HR 72) so I am increasing Labetalol to 200 mg BID.

EDVISIT^42272668^SPARKS, CHARLES^8/13/2079^SORENSEN, SAUL

This patient was seen with resident, Dr. Leach.  Resident's note

was reviewed.  The patient was seen and examined by me, and I

confirm the resident's findings.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In brief, this is a 74-year-old

gentleman who presents with 2 days of chills, fevers, fatigue,

and increased urinary frequency.  He has no other complaints or

associated symptoms.

Please review resident's note for full details of past medical

history, social history, review of systems, medications, and

allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  I confirm the physical exam is as

documented.  The patient is awake, alert, in mild to moderate

respiratory distress, breathing with a respiratory rate at 34,

oximetry noted at 88% on room air, temperature is 102 Fahrenheit,

pulse is 104, blood pressure is 213/89, and oximetry came up

nicely to 93% on 4 liters and 100% on nonrebreather facemask. 

Neck is supple.  Mucous membranes are dry.  Lungs reveal slightly

decreased breath sounds at the bases; however, there are few

crackles noted in the left lower base.  Heart is tachycardic but

regular.  The remainder of the exam is unremarkable.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count is noted at 11.6 and hematocrit

28.2.  This is close to the patient's baseline.  BUN and

creatinine 69 and 5.8, 5.8 is quite elevated for this patient. 

However, he has been evaluated for recent diagnosis of renal

failure by the Nephrology Service.  Bicarbonate is 21 and

potassium is 4.3.  Urinalysis reveals some blood and protein,

otherwise not suggestive of an infection.  EKG is tachycardic

with left ventricular hypertrophy in a strain pattern.  Chest

x-ray shows diffuse fluffy infiltrates bilaterally with bilateral

pleural effusions, few Kerley B lines, and fluid in the lungs

fissures.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was covered with

ceftriaxone and azithromycin for his presumed pneumonia.  He also

received nitro paste for preload reduction as well as a Foley

catheter and Lasix, all for his CHF.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was admitted to the hospital.

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

DIAGNOSES:  Pneumonia, CHF, and renal failure.

STUDIES:
Plain Films:
     FINDINGS:
     Right hip: There is a transverse transcervical fracture through
     the sphenoid.  There is lateral superior displacement of the
     distal segment.  There is no evidence of dislocation.
     
     Pelvis: There is diffuse osteopenia involving the pelvis.  Again
     noted is a transcervical fracture to the right femur.  There is
     superior lateral displacement of the distal fracture segment.  The
     sacrum is not well seen secondary to overlying bowel gas.  Minimal
     degenerative changes of the lumbar spine are noted.
     
     Shoulder: There is no evidence of left shoulder dislocation or
     acute fracture.  The visualized lung fields and ribs are intact.
     There is minimal degenerative change involving the left a.c.
     joint.
     
     Chest: Comparison to 10/31/97.  Multiple pulmonary nodules are
     noted.  There is no evidence of focal consolidation or pulmonary
     edema.  No large pleural effusion or appreciable pneumothorax is
     identified.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
     Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Right transcervical femoral fracture.  No evidence of dislocation.
     
     No evidence of shoulder dislocation.
     
     Multiple pulmonary nodules consistent with metastatic disease.
     
     FINDINGS:
     Previously noted minimally displaced right hip fracture.
     Osteoarthrosis of the knee. Soft tissues swelling along the medial
     aspect of the knee is noted.  There are vascular calcifications.
     Generalized osteopenia.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Right hip fracture as previously described.  Osteoarthrosis of the
     knee. 
       
EKG: Sinus bradycardia.


ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN:


87yo F with h/o metastatic pancreatic CA s/p 1 dose of gemcitabine and biliary stenting, CKD, DM, and HTN who p/w right hip fracture s/p mechanical fall at home. The plan of care by issue is as follows:


(1)     Right hip fracture: Patient will require post-operative anti-coagulation. Patient is undergoing high-risk procedure and is also at increased risk for VTE given cancer dx. According to guidelines from ACCP:


#UFH 5000 Units SC TID [or LMWH &gt;3400 Units SC QD (her CrCl &lt;30, therefore renally dosed = LMWH 30mg SC QD)] to be started either in PACU or on the floor.
#Compression stockings
#Pneumo-boots
#Plan to continue VTE prophylaxis for 4-6 weeks post-op
#Encourage ambulation as soon as tolerated (per ortho, pt might be ambulatory as soon as tomorrow)


(2)     DM
Patient recently started on insulin at home. Will continue half dose of home insulin with IVF with glucose.
#RISS, until tolerating POs, then restart normal insulin.


(3)     Dispo
Plan to D/C when clinically stable post-op. Per PCP, patient would like to return directly home after surgery without rehab (home rehab). Family notes that patient currently lives at daughter&#8217;s home where there are many steps which would make home rehab difficult.


#Consider rehab placement, follow-up attending recs, discuss with family in AM

SOB x 24-36 hrs
****************************************************


HPI: 
Ms. Edgar is a 64 y/o anxious female who presents with SOB x 24-36 hrs, mild SSCPl  and a feeling that ""the fluid is coming back.""  She has a long history of COPD on home oxygen, NSCLC s/p LLL resection in Oct 2121, ?CHF, and hx of PE with coumadin recently stopped. She said she felt her fluid level increase x 1.5 weeks, called her doctor who increased her lasix to 80 QDay 4 days ago and then 80BID yesterday. She thinks this is helping with the fluid but still has increased SOB at rest since yesterday afternoon. She can't remember what her PE felt like but says that this is more like fluid overload. She has a mild nonproductive cough and no hemoptysis. No fevers or sick contacts. She had SSCP today at noon that was gone in the ED but she says returned while on the floor, with no radition, no n/v/diaphoresis, no palpitations.  She said she can normally walk with a walker ~ 100 ft, but could not get up yesterday or today d/t pain.  


She has a history of multiple COPD and CHF exacerbations that have led to hospitalization.


ED Course: The patient was HR 97, BP 120/54, RR22, 98% on 4LNC in the ED, temp not recorded.  She was in mild respiratory distress and received albuterol nebulizer 2.5 mg x 1, KCl 40 meq PO x 1, Percocet 5/325 x 2 tablets.

EKG: 

Q wave in III, intermittent PACs, very low voltage.  Largely unchanged from previous - PACs may be slightly more freuqent now but were present previously.
****************************************************



Imaging:
PE-Protocol CT Scan CHEST/legs , Impression and Critical Findings:      1.No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism.  Linear filling defect in      the apical segmental artery of the left upper lobe could represent      chronic embolus.     2.Suboptimal opacification of the femoral veins.  Evaluation of DVT      is suboptimal.  Ultrasound of the lower extremities for deep      indicated to rule out DVT clinically indicated.     3.Evaluation of pulmonary parenchyma somewhat limited respiratory      motion.  There is bilateral subsegmental atelectasis.  The patient      has undergone prior lower lobe wedge resection.
  4. There are multiple mediastinal and hilar      lymph nodes, which are some centimeters in size.  They are slightly      more prominent than in the previous exam.  The right hilar lymph node      now measures 0.9 cm in short axis. The visualized thyroid gland      appears normal.  There are atherosclerotic vascular calcifications of      the coronary arteries.

5.      Legs: There is suboptimal opacification of the femoral veins limiting evaluation for deep venous thrombosis.  Doppler ultrasound would be      indicated to look for DVT. Significant bilateral degenerative changes      of the hips are seen.

****************************************************


Assessment:

 64F with h/o NSCLC, COPD, CHF who presents with 36 hours of increasing SOB and a feeling that ""the fluid is coming back.""  Has been on increasing doses on furosemide this week which has improved edema per patient but breathing is still worse today.  No other major symptoms.  



Plan:





#
 SOB
Patient presents with increasing SOB in the context of increasing ankle size and sense that she is hypervolemic.  Increased lasix has improved her fluid status but did not fully resolve her respiratory issue, which is worse today than yesterday. Differential includes CHF with fluid overload, PE, malignancy with obstructive component, PNA, or COPD exacerbation with viral infection. Increasing pulmonary hypertension a concern (h/o hypoventilation syndrome, RVH on echo, worsening dyspnea).
-Large acute PE ruled out with CT
-? of whether mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes have increased in size since previous, no other obvious progression of NSCLC, CT findings would not account for her dyspnea
-CXR and CT negative for acute PNA
-CXR and CT show mild atalectasis, possible interstitial fluid, but show no effusions or other significant signs of fluid overload.  BNP is not very high.  However, patient has poor PFTs and small change in volume status may tip her into respiratory distress.  Cough c/w increased volume or viral infection
-Plan is to continue with diuresis as volume overload is most likely explanation of her respiratory status, furosemide 80 mg BID with PRN lasix as needed to maintain fluid status -500-1.0 L tomorrow.  Avoiding more aggressive diuresis as she has a history of over-diuesis with ARF.


-Continue home Tiotropium, Albuterol, Fluticasone Prop/Salmeterol 500/50 (Advair Diskus 500/50) 


#
 NSCLC
Likely not the cause of tonight's presentation with acute SOB, although chest CT must be re-evaluated for possible evidence of cancer.  Mild or no increased size of mediastinal lymph nodes may be concerning.  
-F/U with Dr. Lacey in AM, patient wants all information regarding imaging results and prognosis directly from Dr. Lacey
-Appt already scheduled for July 13th with Dr. Lacey for f/u


#Anxiety/Depression
Patient prescribed clonazepam 0.25 BID but is taking it 0.25 in AM, 0.25 in PM, and additional 0.5 QHS for significant anxiety.  Additionally takes seroquel, pregabalin, fluoxetine.  Patient is very anxious on exam with intermittent crying, fearful expression.
-Continue on home regimen Seroquel, pregabalin, fluoxetine
-Clonazepam  0.25 QAM, 0.5 mg QHS, 0.25 daily PRN while in house


#Cardiac: Continue with home meds, will diurese as above for possible CHF exacerbation
 -Continue ASA, metoprolol, furosemide, simvastatin  


#DM
Home regimen is 70/30 50 units BID and Levemir 40-50 units QHS, titrated to sugars. Lowered totalo dose of insulin to 100 (70% of home dose), distibuted between basal and mealtime insulin, with additional sliding scale
-Continue to up-titrate insulin 


#Chronic Back Pain
-Continue percocet and lidocaine patches PRN.


Other Chronic issues (GERD, endometriasl hyperplasia, skin care)
-Continue meds as described in medication section



#Care Providers: Dr. Lacey (Surg Onc), Dr. Arthur Qin (PCP), Daughter Xiang 045-200-7477


#
 Presumed Full Code: Code needs to be discussed with patient in the morning; due to patient's significant anxiety, the discussion was not appropriate at this time. Patient said she was too anxious to discuss her medical problems or possible treatment.


#Dispo: Pending.  Patient lives at home but has been in rehab previously.  Daughter is Xiang, 045-200-7477, who lives with and takes care of her mother.

Of note, PFTs showed obstructive defect FEV1/FVC 65% w/ FEV1 44% w/ low DLCO/VA 53% concerning for severe COPD w/ loss of alveolocapillary units but DLCO seems



# SHORTNESS OF BREATH. Multifactorial.
-Concern for worsening pulmonary HTN.  
Note there was a large PA, RVSP unable to be determined on ECHO but RVH w/ mulitple etiologies that could contribute to pulmonary HTN (chronic PEs, L sided CHF). Needs pulmonary HTN w/u w/ RHC. Will contact Dr. Quant.

NSCLC. Pt had a T1N0Mx adenocarcinoma resected 10/2121 and followed by Dr. Quentin Lacey from thoracic surgery. Chest CT appears stable from 3/27/2123 but will have him review given the one LN is .9-1.5 cm - will ask if it is amenable to biopsy.
-Diastolic CHF - normal TTE (LVEF 76%, No WMAs.) w/ 2-3+ pitting edema. BNP 423. Diurese until Cr increases. Goal TBB -1L. Will f/u on lasix 80 mg PO BID. 

-Morbid obesity w/ obesity hypoventilation syndrome continue on BiPAP

-Hx of PE. Will f/u w/ radiology re: chronic nature of PE 

-COPD &#8211; on 2-2.5L home O2. Diffuse emphysema. Standing nebs. VBG before BiPAP



# DM II - last A1c 5.1 on 2/13. Switch to Lantus/Aspart while in hospital b/c we do not have 70/30.

Persistent cough



HPI:



Ms. Edgar is a 64 year-old frequently hospitalized woman with CHFpEF (EF = 71%), COPD on 2.5L home O2 and chronic steroids (currently 10 mg prednisone), OSA on BiPAP, CKD, and chronic pain on chronic narcotics, who presents with persistent cough productive of green sputum after recently being treated for influenza.  According to the patient, she left the hospital, completed the course of Tamiflu and azithromycin on 2/24, and continued to feel poorly, with a chronic nagging cough that was productive of dark green sputum. 
No fever, chills, sweats, myalgias, or SOB.  Yesterday, she developed worsening pain, especially in her ribs, extending across the anterior surface; she said the pain is worse with movement but does not vary with respiration or cough.  She is unable to ambulate, as she states she does at baseline with a walker.  



This is her tenth hospital and fourteenth ED visit to MCH in the past year (there are records in the chart of OSH visits as well).  On interview she is tearful regarding her readmission, stating that she &#8220;tries so hard&#8221; to stay out of the hospital, &#8220;but what am I supposed to do when I am sick?&#8221;



ED Course:



In the ED, a CXR showed a RLL patchy opacity suggestive of pneumonia. She received 750 mg levofloxacin, 1 g vancomycin, nebulizer treatments, and morphine for pain control.  



ROS



On interview, she endorses only rib pain and back and hip pain that she says is chronic from her spinal stenosis.  She also complains of the chronic cough described above.  No CP, SOB, dysuria, pyuria, N/V/D.



MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY 



- Influenza: Recently discharged on 2/22/2124 after being diagnosed with influenza A.  She was treated with nebulizers, tamiflu, and azithromycin for 5 days.

RADIOLOGY:



CXR (3/4): RLL patchy opacity.



ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN



64 year-old morbidly obese woman with DM2, OSA, COPD on 2.5L home O2, OSA, recently treated for influenza A, presents with persistent cough productive of green sputum and rib pain.



#)  Productive cough: Has leukocytosis and haziness especially on lateral CXR.  In the absence of other symptoms (new O2 requirement, SOB, pleuritic chest pain, fevers/chills), a diagnosis of pneumonia is difficult to make.  However, she is on chronic steroids and narcotics at baseline and may not mount a typical symptomatic response.

-        Continue HAP coverage started in ED (vanc+cef)
 for seven days
-        Respiratory cultures ordered



#)  Multiple re-hospitalizations: as above, she has been admitted at ten times in the past year just to MCH alone.  A viable long-term plan for outpatient management is essential.

      -  Consider complex care committee consult this admission



#)  Prophy:  Fragmin 5000; senna+colace; H2 blocker (given chronic steroid use)



#)  F/E/N: regular diet.

September 28, 2132  Endocrine/Diabetes



Present Illness:  

Asked to see this 66 year old man who was transferred to LEPROSARIUM for care of an ischemic R foot. He has had a series of illness over the spring, beginning with a hospitalization for pneumonia in June. He later developed what was thought to be a splenic subcapsular hematoma (on Coumadin for chronic atrial fibrillation) and then subsequently developed LUQ pain and was found to have a splenic abscess that was drained. In the course of this illness, he also developed an ischemic R foot and was found (at what stage?) to have a popliteal aneurysm. 



At the time of his admission, he was found to have diabetes. He has been treated with Lantus insulin, most recently 15 Units at bedtime, on which regimen he has had consistent overnight drops, often to hypoglycemic levels. He reports that he weighed about 200 pounds before this illness but has lost about 50 pounds. 



Retinopathy:   He has had an eye exam in the recent past but I do not know any details.

Nephropathy:  BUN/Cr 8/0.77

Neuropathy:    Do not get a history of peripheral neuropathy

Cardiac:           Aware of having atrial fibrillation for about 4 years. Not aware of any history of coronary artery disease.

Vascular:         ? claudication preceding this spring&#8217;s illness.

RE:                  Oliver Jain
LEPROSARIUM:              962-85-18


Dear Dr. Colon:


I am writing to inform you that I am seeing Mr. Oliver Jain in followup.  Mr. Jain was admitted to my service in transfer for right lower extremity ischemia and gangrene following atheroembolization from a popliteal aneurysm, as you know.  He was admitted in early September and stayed until early October.  During his hospital stay here his wounds were addressed.  He underwent angiograms to evaluate his arterial anatomy and he underwent reconstruction of the right wherein covered stent graft was used to cover disease in his proximal femoral artery and then he underwent an above knee to below knee popliteal artery bypass using PTFE with ligation of the aneurysm.  He also subsequently underwent angioplasty of his posterior tibial artery.  Given his atheroembolic phenomenon he had very limited vasculature remaining in the foot and I was concerned that the forefoot gangrene would progress and he would wind up losing the right foot.  In the interim since his discharge he appears to be doing quite well.  The gangrene of the right foot has remained stable with clearcut demarcation of the right first, second and third toes.  He also has some heel ulceration that I am hoping to nurse through.  He denies any rest pain or pain in the foot.  He has no evidence of fevers, chills, rigors or shakes in the interim.  He has since been discharged to home and has been walking with a walking shoe.  His left lower extremity aneurysm is yet to be treated and he has not developed any symptoms with regards to the left lower extremity.  He has been taking his Coumadin regularly and has had therapeutic INRs as he reports.  


On exam today he is doing quite well.  He is in good spirits and appears much better than in the hospital.  His head and neck exams were unremarkable.  His lungs were clear.  Heart was regular.  His proximal groin and leg incisions have healed up nicely, however there is some dry eschar on the midportion of the wound.  With regards to the toes he has clearcut demarcation and heel ulceration.  There is no evidence of cellulitis, induration or infection of the right lower extremity.  He continues to have a stable looking foot on the left.  Given his extensive peripheral vascular disease I performed PVRs in the office today, which revealed that he has pulsatile PVRs at the right calf and ankle.  He also has slight pulsatile PVRs at the right transmetatarsal level.  This bodes well with regards to his revascularization as well as his potential to either heal or remain stable with regards to the necrosis on the right foot.  His left calf, ankle and transmetatarsal PVRs were similar.  


In summary, this is an unfortunate gentleman who developed atheroembolic phenomena resulting in digital ischemia as well as heel ischemia with the potential for limb loss in the near future of the right lower extremity.  He does have an untreated aneurysm on the left with potential for atheroembolization of the left lower extremity.  Given this concern, I will proceed next with a left lower extremity revascularization to exclude the popliteal aneurysm so that he does not develop limb-threatening gangrene of the left.  With regards to the right I will try to initiate some hyperbaric oxygen therapy and will probably re-evaluate his distal circulation with an angiogram at the time of his next admission or some time thereafter.  I am hoping to facilitate healing of the heel wound with the final outcome of a transmetatarsal amputation of the right lower extremity but will see how it goes.  My thanks again for this referral.  I apologize for not sending you correspondence earlier.  With this correspondence I will send you his operative diagram as well as his most recent discharge summary.


Sincerely,




Quincy T. Uselton, M.D.

HPI: Mr. Jain is a 67 year old male with a h/o DM, HTN, HL, Chronic Afib, PVD and bilateral popliteal aneurysm s/p R popliteal thrombosis w/ resultant RLE ischemia and dry gangrene of heel, toes and forefoot.  He has since undergone a R SFA to BK popliteal bpg w/ saphenous vein graft and 8mm PTFE w/ angioplasty to the R PTA.  In March of this year he underwent a distal bpg from the R posterior tibial artery to the plantar artery and then a R TMA later that month. His R TMA has healed well since then. He is also s/p L fem-pop bpg to repair his L popliteal aneurysm.  



He saw Dr. Uselton in follow up last week at which time graft surveillance duplex showed normal functioning graft on the left, however on the right he appears to have a high-grade stenosis at the distal aspect of the femoral popliteal graft.  The more distal graft on the right, which is the vein graft to the plantar artery in the foot remains patent.  



He denies recent h/o fevers/chills, N/V, abdominal pain, or neurological sx. He c/o some RLE edema for the past 3 weeks. His PCP put him on a water pill but it had no effect.



He continues on coumadin for graft patentcy. His last dose was Saturday.

SYMPTOMS



FINDINGS


The inflow (the left  mid superficial femoral artery)  is patent.  The 


proximal anastomosis is widely patent.  The proximal, mid- and distal graft is

  widely patent.  The distal anastomosis terminates in the popliteal artery 


(below the knee)  and demonstrates a significant increase in peak systolic 


velocity, correlating with 50-99% stenosis.  The distal native ( posterior 


tibial artery)  is patent.



IMPRESSION


1. Patent the left mid superficial femoral to popliteal artery (below the 


knee) BPG with &gt;50 % stenosis in the distal anastomosis


2. The mid- distal graft velocities of 41.0  - 22 cm/sec  suggest a 


compromised graft.





CXR-lungs clear, heart size upper limit of normal.





A/P:  67M w/ a h/o HTN, HL, DM, PVD and bilateral popliteal aneursyms s/p L fem-pop bpg; R popliteal thrombosis and subsequent R fem-pop bpg, R PT to plantar bpg and R TMA; presents with stenosis of the distal anastamosis of his femoral popliteal graft on the Right. He will undergo angiogram with possible angioplasty of graft stenosis.

She present for evaluation of abdominal pain that has been present for months but became unbearable prompting a visit to the emergency room.  Mrs. Haynes reports that over the past few months she has been experiencing weight loss, early satiety, night sweats and fatigue.  He abdominal pain is described as a sharp to achy pain that started in her right side, progressed to her epigastric and suprapubic are and then her left side.  Currently it is diffuse associated with nausea and vomiting.  She denies bowel problems has had some difficulty with urination and some frequency since admission but this is generally not a problem.  ROS is also pertinet for HA which are chronic and palpations both of which are hard to describe.

IMPRESSION:     1. Mediastinal, bilateral hilar, supraclavicular,     retroperitoneal, and gastrohepatic adenopathy likely represents     lymphoma rather than sarcoidosis given the patient age and     abdominal involvement.     2. Bilateral adrenal nodules.
 
Path: 04/10/2102 PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:A. SPECIMEN DESIGNATED ""4R LYMPH NODES, BIOPSY"" (including FSA):     Lymph node with non-necrotizing granulomata (see NOTE).B. SPECIMEN DESIGNATED ""4R LYMPH NODES, BIOPSY"":     Lymph node with non-necrotizing granulomata (see NOTE).


Impression:  Mrs. Haynes is a pleasant 67 yo female with biopsy demonstrating non-caesating granululoma in a left eye nodule and mediastinal lymph nodes.  Cx data was not obtained.  However, hx is not suggestive of past tuberculosis risk factors.  Clinical picture very suggestive of systemic sarcoidosis.  At this time she does not have an absolute indication for sarcoid treatment but she may benefit symptomatically from low dose steroids.  At this time she is reluctant to start steroids without discussing it with her family and Dr. Villalpando.


Recommendations:  
 
-Would consider Cardiac MRI given her hx of palpitations as cardiac sarcoid is an absolute indication for treatment.
-Would recommend checking PPD
-Would recommend starting prednisone 30mg po qday.  Will discuss this further with patient and family tomorrow.  There is no rush for treatment at this time and we could waite until Dr. Villalpando is available to speak with Mrs. Haynes.
-Would also recommend Bactrim prophylaxis while she is on greater than 15 mg Po prednisone.  1 DS M/W/F.
-Will follow.




Thank you for this interesting consult. Please call with questions.
 
Patient seen examine and case discussed with Dr. Layton.

Re:  Dalila Haynes
       783-61-34-3


Dear Dr. Kay: 


I saw Dalila Haynes today in consultation concerning the possibility of neurosarcoidosis.  She comes with her daughter who assists with the history.  I will review her history for the record.


She is a 69-year-old right-handed woman who was hospitalized at the Promptcare in July 2103 for evaluation of mental and motor slowing, memory loss, and weight loss.  Her daughter notes that she had deteriorated over the course of a month or two.  Her movements slowed down, and she became unsteady on her feet, and her memory deteriorated.  This culminated in a fall in July prompting her hospitalization.  During that hospitalization a head CT on 7/25/03 was reported unremarkable.  (There is mild ventriculomegaly on it.)  An MRI of the brain on 7/28 showed a few dots of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus. There was no abnormal enhancement.  This was consistent with small vessel stroke.  EEG showed generalized slowing of the background in the theta and delta range with no epileptiform features.  An LP showed normal glucose (74), elevated protein (102), lymphocytic pleocytosis (18-20 WBC, 56-69% lymphocytes, 29-40% monocytes, and 2-4% neutrophils) and 0-1 RBC.  CSF ACE was normal.  Cultures were negative.  CSF VDRL was negative.  Because she has a history of sarcoidosis, it was thought that this likely represented neurosarcoidosis.  She was started on prednisone 40 mg daily.  Her daughter has noted some improvement in her movements and cognition since starting the prednisone, but she remains abnormal.  She has lowered the prednisone to 10 mg daily now.  Reviewing the laboratory studies today, I see that although an RPR was non-reactive, a TA-IgG was positive, and the confirming treponemal tests (FTA) was also positive at the state lab.  She and her daughter are aware of no prior history of syphilis.  Other studies during her hospitalization included low serum Na (133) and Mg (1.3), normal vitamin B12, folate, TSH, and ESR (20).  CSF HSV PCR was negative.  HbA1C was elevated at 8.6.  


She has a history of asthma going back many years.  According to her daughter, she had a skin lesion excised from near her left eye about two years ago.  Apparently, this showed noncaseated granuloma, and that is when the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was first made.  She then had a mediatinoscopy on 4/10/02.  Biopsy of mediastinal nodes showed granulomatous inflammation without caseating necrosis, supporting the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.  She has type II DM, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, GERD, and she has had a thyroid adenoma.  


Her current medications are prednisone 10 mg daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, troglitazone, metformin, glyburide, sisinoril, pravastatin, vitamin D, calcium CO3, Colace, and an inhaler for her asthma as needed.  She is allergic to sulfa agents and to fluticasone nasal spray.  There is no history of allergy to PCN.  


Her parents both died of some type of cancer.  There is no family history of sarcoidosis or of neurologic disease.


She is a widow.  She has four children.  She used to work for Lowe's.  She now lives with a daughter. 


She has had no recent fever or chills.  Her weight has been stable and her appetite good.  There is no history of exertional chest pain or palpitations.  There is no history of cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.  She has had no rash or joint symptoms.


Pulse 126, regular.  BP 126/66.  She is obese.  Ears, nose, and throat are clear.  There are no cranial bruits.  The neck is supple with full carotid pulses and no bruits.  There are wheezes bilaterally.  The heart is regular with no murmur.  The abdomen is benign.  The extremities are normal.


There is general psychomotor slowing.  She is oriented to time, expect that she gets the date off by two days as Aug 31.  She is oriented to place.  She is inattentive.  She is able to recite the months in order, but she gets lost trying to recite them in reverse.  She has trouble registering 4 words, and she recalls only 2 of 4 after three minutes.  There is no aphasia.  She cannot copy interlocking pentagons and her copy of a 3D cube shows poor spacial representation.  


The visual fields are full.  The pupils are 3 mm and normally reactive.  The fundi are poorly visualized.  .  The eye movements are full and conjugate with no nystagmus; pursuit movement are saccadic.  Facial sensation is intact.  Facial power is normal and symmetric.  Hearing is grossly intact.  Weber and Rinne tests are normal.  The palate elevates normal.  Gag is present.  The sternocleidomastoid and trapezius power are normal.  The tongue protrudes in the midline.  Muscle bulk, tone, and power are normal.  There is a low-amplitude, high-frequency tremor in action and rest.  Temperature and pinprick sensation are diminished in the lower extremities with a distally-predominant gradient.  Reflexes are normal (2/4) and symmetric in the upper extremities and at the knees and absent at the ankles.  Plantar responses are flexor.  Coordination is intact.  Romberg is negative.  Gait and station are normal.


Her treponemal test for syphilis came back positive from the hospitalization in July.  Since syphilis, too, could cause noncaseating granulomas, and she has clearly has syphilis at some point in the past which was probably untreated, this raises some doubt about the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.  I will review that issue with you and with Dr, Villalpando.  She had CSF pleocytosis in July.  With that and the positive treponemal test (FTA), she will need a full course of intravenous penicillin for presumed neurosyphilis.  I will discuss arrangements for possible outpatient management of hatt with a PICC line and outpatient VNA services.  Concerning her need for prednisone, I think that will depend on our interpretation of the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in light of this new diagnosis.  If the evidence of sarcoidosis is not strong with this alternative diagnosis, then we can plan to complete the course of penicillin and taper and discontinue the prednisone and then follow her clinical course, her CSF, and her syphilis serologies.


Finally, from the MRI of 7/28, shows a couple of tiny foci of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus.  These are most consistent with small vessel ischemic strokes.  She has multiple risk factors for common small vessel disease and stroke, but in the context of her inflammatory CSF and evidence of prior syphilis, we must also consider cerebrovascular syphilis as the likely cause of this.


I would recommend treatment now with a 14-day course of high-dose (20-24 million units a day) penicillin.  She is already on prednisone which might help to prevent any possible Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.  I think that if she remains stable after the initiation of her PCN therapy, then we can plan to taper and then discontinue the prednisone, to follow her clinically and with repeated LP, and determine any need for future corticosteroid therapy on her course.  


Thank you for this consultation.




Sincerely,

NEUROLOGY RESIDENT CONSULT NOTE 





PATIENT NAME: Dalila Haynes
MRN: 78361343
DATE OF CONSULT: 1/30/04



 
Consulted by: ED for altered mental status and generalized weakness



HPI:   

69 yo F h/o systemic sarcoidosis (extensive adenopathy in the chest, abdomen, and adrenal glands, and has been on corticosteroids), CNS syphillis s/p treatment  who presents with several weeks increasing generalized weakness and several days of increasing confusion. Patient is unable to give a reliable history; history from daughter Inez Haynes, whom I called on the phone, and from LMR (primarily Dr. Keondre Viera's August neurology note). Her daughter reports that current decline is similar to her presentation in July 2103.


She was hospitalized at Promptcare in July 2103 for evaluation of mental and motor slowing, memory loss, and weight loss that had progressed over 1 to 2 months. Head CT on 7/25/03 with only mild ventriculomegaly. An MRI of the brain on 7/28 showed a few dots of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus. There was no abnormal enhancement. This was consistent with small vessel stroke. EEG showed generalized slowing of the background in the theta and delta range with no epileptiform features. She had normal vitamin B12, folate, TSH, and ESR (20). CSF HSV PCR was negative. HbA1C was elevated at 8.6. An LP showed normal glucose (74), elevated protein (102), lymphocytic pleocytosis (18-20 WBC, 56-69% lymphocytes, 29-40% monocytes, and 2-4% neutrophils) and 0-1 RBC. CSF ACE was normal. Cultures were negative. CSF VDRL was negative. She was initially treated with prednisone 40 mg daily tapered down to 10 mg daily. In follow up, it was noted that RPR was non-reactive, a TA-IgG was positive, and the confirming treponemal tests (FTA) was also positive at the state lab. This was thought to represent neurosyphillis and she was admitted and treated w/ 14 days of IV penicillin. Prednisone was subsequently tapered to off since her presentation was thought to be consistent w/ neurosyphillis and not neurosarcoidosis.



Per her daughter, patient had improved back to being independent of ADL's and walking with a cane witout assistance. Over the last few weeks, she has gotten progressively more weak with multiple falls. Has trouble standing now, seems unsteady on her feet, has been primarily in bed for the last few days, requiring assistance to get to the bathroom or she falls down. Over the last several days, she has become even more globally weak and confused. She has been talking about relatives who are not in the house, thinking that they are there; thinking that the closet is the bathroom. It was a slow progression over a few weeks and then accelerated over the last few days. Patient reports intermittent headaches.


On presentation to the ED, she was noted to be tachycardic in the 120's (baseline resting tachycardia documented for many months, being worked up by cards), normotensive, afebrile, oriented x 2, and moving all extremities.

IMAGING:
HEAD CT TODAY:
There is no midline shift, mass effect, evidence of acute territorial infarction, or hemorrhage. Ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with stable involutional change. There is no hydrocephalus. Chronic periventricular white matter changes are again noted. There is no significant soft tissue swelling or calvarial fracture. Prominent calcifications of a falx cerebri are incidentally noted. Imaged portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. There is bilateral exophthalmus.
      
CXR: today
Faint opacity seen in the retrocardiac region which  could represent early pneumonia. Clinical correlation and interval follow-up is recommended.


EKG: sinus tachy. no ST changes or Q waves. 



ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: 

69 yo F h/o systemic sarcoidosis (extensive adenopathy in the chest, abdomen, and adrenal glands, and has been on corticosteroids), CNS syphillis s/p treatment  who presents with several weeks of increasing generalized weakness and several days of increasing confusion. Exam notable for poor memory and some confusion about recent events.  Labs are unremarkable except minor electrolyte abnormalities. Head CT unremarkable. Her prior presentation was thought to be most likely due to neurosyphillis as detailed above, though there was still the possibility of neurosarcoid. She has not had a repeat LP to assess for resolution of prior abnormalities, and now that she has a recurrence of symptoms, she should have repeat LP. She should also have an MRI as a thalamic or frontal stroke is another possible etiology. This could be a more global failure to thrive in the setting of deconditioning followed by poor PO's, but this should be a diagnosis of exclusion. CXR raises a question of retrocardiac opacity suggesting possible PNA, but with normal WBC, no URI sx's or cough, and no fever, I think it is unlikely that she has PNA and will follow clinically.


-check her gait
-check ESR



-LP for standard studies and save 5-10 cc for additional studies depending on cell count/TP
-MRI of the brain
-EEG
-further lab w/u pending LP results
-remove foley catheter
-PT consult

HAYNES, DALILA

78361343

04/14/2104



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Haynes is a 69-year-old woman who comes in followup of her recent hospitalization and rehabilitation.  She is here with her daughter.  She notes that she is mostly feeling tired lately.  She is able to walk with help and is even unable to walk upstairs with assistance.  She is here in a wheelchair and says she is kind of tired and lets her daughter gives most of the history even when asked simple questions.  She has been checking her blood sugars and she shows me the results.  In the morning, the sugars have been fairly low in the 57-100 range, around noontime high at 144 up to 398, and in the evening high again 176-245.  She is taking Lantus 38 units at 9:00 p.m. and she is on NovoLog coverage less than 25-0 units, 125-152 units, 151-204 units, 201-256 units, 251-308 units and greater than 310 units.  She would like to switch over her Lantus to the Pens since the pen is so much easier for her.  She complains of hemorrhoids, although she says they are actually getting better, she had previously had four now she has two.  There is no bleeding.  There is no pain, kind of itchy and uncomfortable.  She is in fact not having any problem with constipation at this time.  She is having bowel movements every day.  She is not having any chest pain, no trouble breathing, no fevers, sweats or chills.  No abdominal symptoms.  She notes her stomach is really fine and it just not causing any trouble at all.



MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, lisinopril 40 daily, Lantus 38, NovoLog coverage, omeprazole 40 daily, metoprolol, potassium chloride, Lasix 40 daily, Pravachol 40 nightly, and Symbicort.



ALLERGIES:  Bactrim GI intolerance, fluticasone, cough and sucralfate unknown.



SOCIAL HISTORY:  She has never smoked, no alcohol, no street drugs.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Well developed, well nourished, no acute distress.  Blood pressure 121/65, pulse 106, weight 169.8, and temperature 98.6.  A delightful woman, English speaking and sitting in a wheelchair.  Quite alert, did know the president, could not recall the vice-president or against whom the president ran in the last election.  She did know the day of the week and she knew where she was.  She also remembered to remind me about a prescription when both her daughter and I almost forgot.  She is an absolutely delightful woman, appears well and alert despite the fact that she lets her daughter provides most of the history and responses.  She appears comfortable, breathing easily, no use of accessory muscles of inspiration, speaking in full sentences, no cough, no spine or flank tenderness.  Heart sounds S1, S2, regular rate and rhythm, no murmur, rub or gallop.  Chest is clear to auscultation anteriorly and posteriorly with no rales, wheezes, or rhonchi.  She is clear to percussion.  Extremities:  Without edema, cyanosis or clubbing, no calf tenderness.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1.  Diabetes.  Her A1c today was 6.6, which represents excellent control despite a fairly high glucoses she was recording.  I therefore did not want to increase her regimen despite the high glucoses.  We will continue for now.  I did give her an appointment with the diabetes nurse for help in management of her diabetes.

2.  Hypertension.  Her blood pressure is fine.  We will continue current regimen.  We will check electrolytes.

3.  Tachycardia actually improved relative to her last visit.  She is asymptomatic in this regard except for some fatigue.

4.  Fatigue.  This is most likely due to stepping down from the prednisone 60-40.  This is what the patient and her daughter believe.  She was somewhat fatigued before, but they note that it is worse with this.  She does need to come off the prednisone and Dr. Villalpando who she just saw is going to try to come up with another plan for her. Check cbc.

5.  Acid associated symptoms well controlled with omeprazole.

6.  Right knee mild osteoarthritis, not a problem today.

7.  CNS syphilis status post treatment.

8.  Question of CNS sarcoid currently on 40 mg of prednisone and hopefully she will be able to come off of that and perhaps get started on something else.

9.  Cholesterol.  We will recheck her cholesterol today and will check an SGPT.

10.  Thyroid nodules.  Ultrasound in July 2103 showed stability.

11.  Adrenal adenoma.  Her CAT scan in May 2102 showed stability and some adenopathy consistent with sarcoid.

12.  Lichen simplex chronicus.  Dermatology diagnosis from 2101.  Not addressed today.  Hopefully, she will be stronger at her next visit and we can recheck.

13.  Osteopenia.  She will continue calcium and vitamin D.  I encouraged weightbearing exercise as tolerated.

14.  Glaucoma suspect, not addressed today.

15.  Small vessel ischemic disease.  MRI from July showed changes consistent with small vessel ischemic stroke.  She is currently on aspirin and stable.

16. Hemorrhoids - anusolHC given. Given no bleeding and no pian, this hopefully will fuffice. Recommended avoiding constipation, as she is doing, with lots of dietary fruits and vegetables.

GILLIS, BETTY
78865189
04/22/2085


Ines Estep, M.D.
930 Scotia Way
Big Bear Lake, CO  98839

To Dr. Estep:

I saw Betty Gillis in cardiovascular clinic with Dr. Vicente Noel on 04/22/2085.  Betty Gillis is a very pleasant 73-year-old woman who was recently admitted to the Griffin Memorial Hospital in early February 2085 with a right MCA territory stroke characterized clinically by drooling and left hand weakness.  Fortunately, her symptoms have now resolved and she is back to her regular activities.  We understand that she has also had previous strokes.  In December 2082, she was suffering a dizzy spell and subsequently an MRI of her brain found a posterior circulation cerebellar infarct as well as a couple of basal ganglia lacunar infarct.  She recalls having only V2 clinical events.

She was worked up in the Griffin Memorial Hospital and had a Holter, which demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with minor ectopy only, an echocardiogram, which was reported as essentially normal with the exception of a positive saline contrast bubble study suggesting a patent foramen ovale, an MRI of her head which demonstrated the infarct and marked microvascular disease, as well as a CT angiogram of her head and neck arteries, which demonstrated mild atheroma for the most part with a left internal carotid artery stenosis that was less than 50%.  She is referred to us today for an opinion as to how to manage the possible patent foramen ovale.

This lady has never had cardiac problems otherwise.  There is no history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure.  She does not get exertional chest discomfort (chest pain or shortness of breath) and has no history of syncope or presyncope.  She has no history of PND, orthopnea or edema.  She remains fairly active despite her ataxic gait.  She tells me that she is able to walk several blocks without difficulty and never has any exertional chest pains or shortness of breath.  Moreover, she does not have claudication.  Functional inquiry is otherwise unremarkable save for her usual difficulties with psoriasis and eczema.  She denies difficulties with heartburn or GI bleeding recently.

Past Medical History:
1.  Stroke.
A.  Subcortical basal ganglia stroke.
B.  Cerebellar stroke in December 2085 with subsequent ataxic gait.
C.  Right MCA stroke with left hand weakness in February 2085.
2.  Hypertension
3.  Dyslipidemia.
4.  Insulin insensitivity
5.  Ex-smoker (1-1-1/2 packs per day for approximately 40 years, quit approximately 12 years ago).
6.  Possible patent foramen ovale.
7.  Degenerative joint disease/osteoarthritis.
A.  Status bilateral total knee replacement in 2084.
B.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease/hiatus hernia.
C.  Status post GI bleeding (query secondary to esophagitis)
8.  Osteoporosis.
9.  Bladder incontinence.

There is no history of other cardiac problems.  There is no history of venous thromboembolic disease.  This lady has not had frank diabetes.

Allergies:  She has no known drug allergies.

Current Medical Therapy:
1.  Aggrenox 25/200 p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Prilosec 20 mg p.o. daily.
3.  Doxepin 25 mg daily.
4.  Simvastatin 40 mg p.o. daily.
5.  Atenolol 12.5 mg p.o. daily.
6.  Fosamax 70 mg every week.
7.  BLANK 1 tab daily.
8.  Darifenacin 7.5 mg daily.

Family History:  Betty Gillis is adopted and does not know very much about her biological parents.  She believes that her biological father suffered a stroke at some point, but cannot say for certain how old he was.

Social History:  This woman is single.  She is a retired Secretary.  She is an ex-smoker (more than 40 pack years), but does not drink significant amounts of alcohol.  She has no other history of substance abuse.

Review of Systems:  Functional inquiry is positive for difficulties with psoriasis that are chronic and ongoing.  She has no other new symptoms.  There is no recent GI bleeding.  She has difficulties with bladder incontinence as well.

On physical examination today, her heart rate is 86 beats per minute and regular and her blood pressure is 122/78 in the right arm and 124/80 in the left arm.  Respiratory rate is 20 and she is pink on room air.  Head and neck exam is unremarkable.  There are no carotid bruits.  She has some kyphoscoliosis of her spine.  Her chest examination reveals no dullness to percussion and vesicular breath sounds only.  Her jugular venous pressure is not elevated.  Central pulses are normal in volume and contour.  Her apex beat is within normal limits.  Heart sounds include a normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs.  Her abdomen is soft and nontender.  There are no obvious masses.  Her aorta does not obviously appear to be enlarged.  Her pulses are palpable in her groin, but hard to feel behind her knees and distally.  They are symmetrical.  Informally, ABI test was not done today because she has several weeping eczematous lesions on her legs, which reflects psoriasis that has been excoriated.  A brief neurologic exam reveals dysmetria worse on the left than the right.

Impression:  Betty Gillis has had at least four strokes and has documented evidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease and cerebromicrovascular disease on recent imaging.  We reviewed the echocardiogram today and we wished to confirm with the reading echocardiographer that it is indeed positive.  (It does not look particularly positive to our eyes).  Certainly, if she does not indeed have a patent foramen ovale, there is no issue as to what to do about it.  If she does have one; however, it seems more likely that her strokes reflect her atherosclerotic vascular disease secondary to her atherosclerotic risk factors and that the bulk of treatment should be directed at modulating those.

Her hypertension is controlled today.  Her dyslipidemia is not bad.  However, the LDL is 76 and perhaps there is some added benefit to increasing her simvastatin to 80 mg p.o. daily.  We also note that she has had elevated glucoses in the past, as high as 191, as well as an elevated hemoglobin A1c up to 6.5.  It is probably worth having her screen formally to see whether or not she has type 2 diabetes mellitus versus insulin insensitivity only.  She may benefit from an oral hypoglycemic.

We recommend.
1.  We will review the echocardiogram with the reading echocardiographer to ensure that it does indeed show a patent foramen ovale.
2.  We suggest that she increase her statin from simvastatin 40 mg p.o. daily to simvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily.  We will leave this to her primary care physician to organize.
3.  We suggest that she be screened formally for diabetes mellitus type 2.

We will see her again as necessary, but for the time being, we have no plans to perform an intervention on this lady.

EDVISIT^78865189^GILLIS, BETTY^08/31/85^GUEVARA, ELIZABETH

The patient was seen with Dr. Izaguirre.  Resident's note was

reviewed.  The patient was seen and examined by me.  Please see

the resident's note for details of the patient's past medical,

social, family history, review of systems, and physical exam.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  EKG changes.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old woman with a

history of 2 ischemic strokes in the past, hypertension and high

cholesterol who presents with 1-2 weeks of feeling tired after

breakfast.  She went into Copley Hospital with this complaint today,

is a somewhat difficult historian but denies any chest pain,

shortness of breath, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, arm pain,

diarrhea, constipation, dyspnea on exertion, recent change in her

medications or any other complaints.  Today, she had the symptoms

and was seen at the outside office.  An EKG was performed there

for which she was sent here with a reading of a T-wave inversion

in V2 and V3.  There seems to be lead placement problem V1 and

V3.  Leads appeared ____, but there is a slight T-wave inversion

in what would be V1 and V2, which seems to be new from prior EKG.

 Placement of leads could not be confirmed at CH.  The patient

was sent in here and arrived chest pain free and otherwise

asymptomatic.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, high cholesterol, COPD,

arthritis, ischemic strokes x2, GI bleed in the past,

osteoporosis, and colon polyps.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Bilateral total knee replacements.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a past smoker, never used drugs.  Lives

alone.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unclear as the patient is adopted.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative except for some ____.

MEDICATIONS:  The patient takes PPIs, Prilosec, calcium,

atenolol, Aggrenox, iron, doxepin, Detrol, and simvastatin.

ALLERGIES:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is afebrile, normal and stable vital

signs.  Pulse 73 and blood pressure 129/80.  Awake, alert, in no

distress.  Her exam is essentially unremarkable including clear

and equal breath sounds, normal JVD and regular rate and rhythm. 

No murmurs on cardiac examination.  Abdomen is soft and

nontender.  Skin is warm, dry, and intact except for some

psoriatic lesions that are old.  She has no pedal edema and the

rest of her examination is essentially unremarkable.  EKG in the

Emergency Department shows sinus rhythm at 65 with an upgoing

T-waves in all the precordial leads.  Laboratory examination

reveals negative cardiac enzymes and is otherwise unremarkable. 

PTT 21 and INR 1.  Chest x-ray shows no acute changes.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  She was seen by the CH

cardiologist, Dr. Brock.  In the Emergency Department, given

the patient's vascular disease, the plan is to admit for 2 sets

of enzymes and a stress in the morning.  She is well appearing at

the time of admission.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  EKG changes.

RADIOLOGY/STUDIES:

     1.  Scattered punctate foci of DWI hyperintensity that are not

     well evaluated on ADC or exponential images, in the right MCA/PCA

     border zone distribution.  Given the pattern of signal

     abnormality, these most likely represent subacute infarcts, with

     possible subacute on chronic right posterior corona radiata

     infarct.

     

     2.  Evidence of prior right MCA territory infarct and chronic

     small vessel ischemic disease.

     

     3.  No hemodynamically significant stenosis of the extracranial or

     intracranial circulation.



ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN

75 yo woman with a history of stroke, HTN who presents with L arm numbness. While her deficits appear to have resolved, arguing against stroke, she clearly has multiple punctate foci of DWI hyperintensity that would be consistent with acute stroke. These strokes are in the PCA region and at the watershed region of the MCA/PCA and so could represent both anterior and posterior circulation emboli. Given that her carotid arteries are relatively clear, her heart or arch may be possible sources of embolus.

- Has had stroke workup in the past that has been unrevealing

- Would benefit from a repeat echocardiogram to assess for any new vegetations or thrombi

- Would also benefit from repeat Holter to assess for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation

- Admit to Internal Medicine service

Patient Name: Gillis, Betty

MRN: 8308652

Date of Admission: 9/03/87

Attending: Mercado

Admitting Intern: Dalton Edwards

Source of History: patient, online chart





CC: SOB



HPI: 75 yo woman with a history of R MCA, R cerebellar stroke, TIAs, Iliac vein thrombosis, PFO, and recent RP hematoma and rectus sheath hematoma (at GMH 8/13/87-8/26/87) currently off of anticoagulation because of her recent bleeds. 
Pt reports sudden onset of SOB this AM.  Not associated with any other symptoms.  A contractor who was at her home at the time called EMS who took pt to hospital.  En route she developed nausea and had 1 episode of NBNB emesis.  Otherwise, she denies CP, cough, fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting (other than the episode in the ambulance), change in bowel/bladder habits.  No exacerbating or alleviating symptoms.  Of note, she has some residual left sided weakness from her prior R MCA stroke and some balance issues from her cerebellar stroke.



In the ED the patient was tachypnic with SATS in the low 80s and  placed on oxygen by nasal cannula with improved sats on 4L to the mid 90s.  Then was able to be weaned to room air with sats still in the mid 90s.  She also was tachycardic to the 90s with BPs to the 90/60 with one episode of BP to 78 systolic.  She responded well to fluid with 2L in the ED and improved BPs.  CT showed stable RP and rectus sheath hematomas, no evidence of DVT or iliac thrombosis, and no evidence of PE.  CXR was clear.  



Of note, following her hospitalization at PROMPTCARE in July 2087 for TIA where she was found to have a small PFO and iliac vein thrombosis, she was started on Coumadin.  However, the patient was recently admitted to GMH with rectus sheath and RP hematoma.  Per the patient, she received 8 U PRBC there.  She also received FFP and vitamin K to reverse her Coumadin.  During her hospitalization she was in the ICU for hypotension and tachycardia.  An IVC filter was placed initially but subsequently d/c&#8217;d on 8/26/87.  She was discharged off of anticoagulation.

ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN

75 yo woman with a history of R MCA, R cerebellar stroke, TIAs, Iliac vein thrombosis, PFO, and recent RP hematoma and rectus sheath hematoma (at GMH 8/13/87-8/24/87) currently off of anticoagulation because of her recent bleeds.  Pt reports sudden onset of SOB at rest this AM.  



##SOB: Unclear etiology.  CT PE negative however given history of possible iliac vein thrombosis, highly concerning in setting of being off of anticoagulation in the setting of RP and Rectus sheath hematomas.  However, given her rapid recovery in the ED with nebs and oxygen and subsequent weaning to room air, there is lower concern for a PE.  History of iliac vein thrombosis is unclear and not fully imaged on CT today.  

-continue monitor SOB

-nebs prn

-consider reimaging with CT venogram to assess necessity of anticoagulation/IVC filter

-f/u GMH records



##Elevated amylase/lipase: only one episode nausea/vomiting en route with EMS.  Currently no nausea, benign exam, nl WBC.  

-CT with ?dilated pancreatic duct but no evidence of pancreatitis

Patient is a 34-year-old man who comes in for follow up on his newly 
diagnosed type II diabetes.  He has been very compliant with his 
medication regimen which consists of metformin 850mg PO t.i.d. and NPH 
insulin subQ q.AM.  He has had 2 episodes of sweating, but he did not 
check his blood sugar at the time.  He has not had any frank 
palpitations or lightheadedness.  He did have 1 episode where he had the 
sensation of several extra heart beats.  This was not accompanied by 
other symptoms including no chest pain.  He has never had a fingerstick 
blood glucose below the mid 150's.  I am looking through his log and see 
that his AM prebreakfast glucoses have been between 178-306 and before 
dinner they have been between 157-296.  He has already met several times 
with Makenzie Kim for diabetes education and for tailoring of his 
therapy and has met with a nutritionist to review the concepts of a 
diabetic diet.  
 
On physical exam, he is in no distress, his weight is 231, his blood 
pressure is 132/78 in the right arm sitting.
 
IMPRESSION AND PLAN: He still has high sugars. I will increase his 
insulin regimen.  He is amenable to adding a second injection and so his 
new regimen will be NPH insulin 15 units before breakfast and 15 units 
before bedtime.  And he continues to take metformin 850mg PO t.i.d. and 
I have given him a prescription for this, #90, refills 3, as well as 
syringes and needles, #60, refills 3.  He is to follow up with me in 
several months and sooner if he has new problems or concerns.  I have 
advised him about increasing his level of activity and about maintaining 
his diet and I have also asked him to contact me if he should have any 
symptoms of hypoglycemia and to obtain his fingerstick glucose reading 
at that time as well.

Palacios, NE  73819                             97198841

                                              12-25-90 







The patient is a 36-year-old man who comes in with a problem list that 

includes diabetes, high cholesterol, microalbuminuria, and probable lichen simplex 

chronicus.



Since I last saw him, he has changed insurances and needs new refills on 

all his medications. He has been without it for a couple of days. He has 

had no polyuria or polydipsia, and generally feels well. He has no chest 

pain, shortness of breath - no abdominal discomfort. He has no problems 

with is feet or eyesight. He has not seen an eye doctor in the past 

year.



MEDICATIONS:

Lisinopril, metformin, simvastatin, Glyburide. He is not currently using 

the metronidazole pill any longer. 



Laboratory Data: Last cholesterol was an LDL of 101 in September, Hgb 

A1C of 6.1.



PHYSICAL EXAM:

Patient is well appearing. His blood pressure is 140/82 in the right arm 

sitting, but this is also off his lisinopril. His weight is 168 lbs. 

Examination of the feet reveals response to vibratory sensation and 

light touch. There are no lesions. There is an approximately 2cm 

nonscaling plaque over the dorsal lateral aspect of the right ankle, 

which is pruritic.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1. Diabetes mellitus. Wait until he is back on his medications before 

checking his laboratory tests, including the microalbumin. He will come 

back in a few months to have these done.

2. Hyperlipidemia. I will check his lipids on his return visit.

3. Lichen simplex chronicus. Topical lidex was prescribed b.i.d. to the 

effected area only.



I will see him in several months in follow up visit on his laboratory 

work.

with diabetes and high blood pressure who presents to the

Emergency Room complaining of some sore throat symptoms for 3

days also reporting some chest discomfort that has been on and

off since Friday.  Denies any association with cough or

movement.  I guess it is at rest and also with activity and

noticing also increasing shortness of breath with activity.  No

lower extremity swelling and no PND.  Has been having off and on

chest discomfort.  However, in the past four months, had negative

ETT at Smithers Albany Center per his report.  Denies any

headache, fevers or chills or recent travel.  Did have a negative

ETT by his report at an outside hospital four months ago.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, diabetes

insulin requiring, and hypercholesterolemia.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known allergies.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, lisinopril, metformin, and

anticholesterol medications.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a current smoker, denies any

alcohol or IV drug use.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Hernia repair in the past.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, and

chest discomfort.

otherwise an overweight male in no acute distress.  Sclerae

nonicteric.  Lungs are clear to auscultation.  Cardiac exam S1,

S2, regular rhythm with no gallops, rubs, or murmurs.  Abdomen is

very soft and nontender.  No JVD on exam.  Back on head and neck

exam, TMs are clear bilaterally.  Oropharynx is clear.  Neck is

supple.

LABORATORY DATA:  Currently, still pending.

EKG normal sinus rhythm with no ST-T segment changes or evidence

of ischemia or infarct.

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  A 41-year-old male, diabetic, hypertensive,

presents with URI symptoms.  No evidence of exam or indication

DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: 



CXR: 

	No CHF.  On the lateral view only there is some increased patchy

	opacity in the posterior clear space which could represent

	developing atelectasis or, in the proper clinical setting, could

	represent a subtle focus focus of pneumonia.  There is new

	blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles consistent with a

	small amount of pleural fluid.



Abdominal Ultrasound:

NEGATIVE STUDY.



Exercise Stress Test:

  No ST segment changes were observed during this test.

        Arrhythmias:

          None.

        Comments:

        Fair exercise capacity. At peak exercise, patient complained of

        indigestion feeling relieved by belching after several minutes.

        Negative for ischemia.



EKG: 

NSR.  New TWI in V2, q in III, normal axis and intervals, no ST changes

	          	          

ASSESSMENT/PLAN:



The patient is a 74 yo female with poorly diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presents with acute closed angle glaucoma and nausea and vomiting. 



1.	Glaucoma.



Likely secondary to proliferative diabetic retinopathy.  As recommended by the ophthalmologic consultant, I will give the following meds

	-Xalatan qHS

-Pred Forte QID

-Timolol BID

-Trusopt BID

-Acetazolamide BID

-Alphagan

IOP will be monitored closely.  If it does not trend down, the patient may need surgery in the AM.



2.	Nausea and Vomiting



The differential diagnosis is broad and includes symptoms related to glaucoma, atypical angina, symptoms from an SBO given her history, chemical pancreatitis and viral gastroenteritis.  Of these, I believe that symptoms from glaucoma or gastroenteritis is most likely.  

-	I ordered a KUB on the floor which showed normal bowel gas per unofficial rads read.  

-	I think angina is unlikely given her history.  However, I believe that she needs a stress test given her severe diabetes.  I will be unable to arrange one for tomorrow (weekend day), but I believe she needs one as an out patient study in the near future.  I will give ASA, B blocker and ACE.  I will not give heparin given that her TIMI score is only 1. 

-	Chemical pancreatitis is possible although her exam is so bengin. I will therefore give pt full liqs tonight and follow her for pancreatitis symptoms.



3.	Chronic Renal Failure



This is likely secondary to diabetic nephropathy. Pt is at baseline creatinine



4.	Anemia



Pt is at baseline creatinine.  She was found to have sickle cell trait.  Iron studies, B12, folate WNL. Hct stable



5.	Diabetes



Will continue NPH and Regular insulin and cover with SSI.



6.	Prophylaxis



On nexium.  Holding heparin prophylaxis because the patient is ambulatory.

North East, AL 81699                       CHB9278143
(687) 396-2722                                12-15-72


CHIEF COMPLAINT: Ms. Xia is a 53 year old woman who comes in in 
follow up. She notes that she is still having occasional sweats at 
night. She is using the clonidine but she can't take it two times a day, 
it makes her too sleepy, so she takes it about 3:30 towards the end of 
her workday and then again before she goes to bed. She is having some 
right lower back pain and otherwise is feeling well.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative except as noted. She is also taking the 
Cozaar which she had been taking before. 

She was called back in today as a result of labs which were done 
recently which showed hemoglobin A1C of 8.7, an elevated urine 
microalbuminuria and hypertension which needed follow up.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam today, she is well developed and well 
nourished in no acute distress. Blood pressure 158/116, pulse 80, weight 
166. Pupils are equal and equally reactive to light. Lids and 
conjunctiva normal. Retinal fields normal. Disks sharp. Mouth and 
pharynx without erythema or exudate. No adenopathy or tenderness in the 
submandibular, cervical, posterior cervical, supraclavicular areas. 
Heart sounds: S1, S2, with a II/VI systolic murmur heard best at the 
right sternal border. No rub or gallop. Her chest was clear to 
auscultation anteriorly and posteriorly with no rales, wheezes or 
rhonchi. She was clear to percussion. She has normal bowel sounds. Her 
abdomen was soft and nontender, no mass, organomegaly, and no guarding, 
no rebound. Her extremities are without edema, cyanosis or clubbing. She 
has no spine or flank tenderness. Her neck is supple, no bruits. Her 
skin is essentially quite dry and itchy. She has multiple dark, 
hyperpigmented, post-inflammatory scarring on her lower extremities. Her 
mouth and pharynx are without erythema or exudate. 

IMPRESSION/PLAN:
1. Hypertension. Her blood pressure is really not well controlled. I 
will add atenolol to her regimen 50mg PO q.d. She drinks one cup of 
coffee a day and rarely has alcohol although she notes that she will 
occasionally have one, a scotch, on Friday or Saturday. She does not do 
drugs. She will return in three week for follow up of her blood 
pressure and at that time for a physical exam for which she will be due. 

2. Diabetes. The patient had been told in the past that she had diabetes 
but she was told she did not need any sort of treatment for it. Her 
creatinine was 0.8 last month and I explained to her that with her 
elevated hemoglobin at 8.7 she needs treatment. We will start her on 
Glucophage 500mg PO b.i.d. I expect we will need to increase this and if 
she tolerates this she should increase it to 1000mg over the next week. 
I also explained to her that if she does not eat or she is unable to eat 
or if she is NPO she needs to stop taking this medication. I suggested 
she actually take it with food to insure that she only takes when she is 
eating. I gave her a referral to Ophthalmology and to Podiatry. She also 
requested a glucometer machine and this was ordered for her along with

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Xia is a 57-year-old woman who comes in for evaluation of treatment of diabetes and hypertension, reporting that for the last 3 days she has had trouble with her vision, her blood pressure has been high.  She has been having a lot of headaches.  She has had pain in her right thumb that goes to her right lateral side area.  She has been having hot flashes but no fevers, sweats or chills.  Her sugars have been okay in the 99-120 range, the highest was about 135-140.  She does not really understand why she is feeling so bad with these headaches and other problems.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Conducted in detail and was otherwise negative.



MEDICATIONS:  She has not taken any medications for the last two days.  She does have her diabetes medications but no blood pressure medication.  She usually takes Cozaar 100 daily, Glucophage 1000 b.i.d., Glucotrol XL 5 daily, Lipitor 20 daily, Norvasc 10 daily.  She has not been needing Nexium of late.



ALLERGIES:  Clonidine caused sleepiness and codeine rash.



SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke or use street drugs.  She does have a little bit of white wine when she has guests on occasion.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam, well developed, well nourished, no acute distress.  Blood pressure 152/120, pulse 76, temperature 97.2, weight 166.  Pleasant, articulate in English, she appears comfortable.  Pupils equal, equally reactive to light.  Retinal fields have sharp disks.  Mouth and pharynx without erythema or exudate, no adenopathy or tenderness in the submandibular, cervical, posterior cervical, supraclavicular areas.  Thyroid nontender, non-nodular.  Neck supple, no spine or flank tenderness.  No bruits, no stridor.  Heart sounds S1, S2, regular rate and rhythm, no murmur, rub or gallop.  Chest is clear to auscultation anteriorly and posteriorly with no rales, wheezes or rhonchi.  She is clear to percussion.  Normal bowel sounds.  Abdomen soft, nontender, no mass, organomegaly, no guarding, no rebound.  Extremities are without edema, cyanosis or clubbing, no calf tenderness.  Sensation is intact to microfilament testing bilaterally on her feet.  Pedal pulses are present.  Feet are warm.  There is no rash, maceration, or lesion on her feet.



LABORATORY DATA:  Hemoglobin A1c from October was 7.2.  LDL from last May was 164.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1.  Diabetes.  Her diabetes has been near goal.  We will recheck glucose, hemoglobin A1c, UA, and microalbuminuria and see how she is doing today.

2.  Elevated cholesterol.  Her cholesterol was nowhere near our target of 100.  She is on an increased Lipitor.  We will check cholesterol, see how she is doing at this point, and an OT, PT to make sure she is tolerating the medication.

3.  Hypertension.  All of her symptoms today are most likely due to her hypertension.  I explained at great length that the reason for all of her symptoms is the fact she stopped taking her medication.  She seemed surprised that it would have such an immediate and strong effect and I explained to her that it does.  She has to take her medication every day.  I told her she had to leave the Carolyn Huntington right now, go immediately to the drugstore to pick up the medication and she said she would do that.  I also asked her to return next week so we can recheck her blood pressure and make sure it is controlled.

4.  Health maintenance.  I will schedule her for a mammogram.

5.  Colonic adenoma from 11/2076.  She will need follow-up colonoscopy every three years per GI.

ENT-Sclera were white, fundi disc sharp, conjunctiva clear, tympanic membranes normal, ear canal AS somewhat red. The oropharynx was pink without exudate. The neck was supple with out adenopathy. 

LUNG- clear bilaterally, without rhonci, wheeze or rales, Normal excursion was noted. 

Cor- heart rate was normal, rhythm was regular. No murmurs, gallops or rubs were detected 

Extremities: no clubbing cyanosis or edema. 

Skin- no abnormal lesions noted.







Impression

Ear- benign exam but symptomatic - try cortisporun otic

 

HTN- very high, no sign of end organ injury at this moment- will increase atenolol to 100, and have her rtc for recheck.  It would be helpful to know whether cramps came from hctz or amilodipine.

Dictated at: 05/06/2092 by EDWARD XAYASANE, M.D. 



 

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right leg pain and difficulty walking.   

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Wilhelm is a 68-year-old right-handed female who has had a three-week history of having right leg pain and difficulty walking. She states that her pain started about three weeks ago when she was bending and picking up a pot. She states she had a pain in her back that radiated around her right side down her groin into her medial leg, not past the knee. She states that it went away at that time. The next day she felt worsened and had difficulty working and saw her physician.  An MRI was ordered. Since then, she feels about 60-75 percent better. She states that her pain is constant and describes it as a sharp pain. She does state she feels weak and her knee would buckle. She does not have any numbness or tingling. She states she uses a walker to get to her bathroom, however, otherwise stays in the recliner. Her symptoms are increased with lying down and standing and decreased with sitting.  

 

Therapeutically, she has not received any physical therapy or occupational therapy. She is currently taking Darvocet, however, less frequently, and Celebrex for arthritis. Diagnostically, she has had an MRI scan in April 2092 that showed multi-level spinal stenosis, most prominent at L3/L4, especially on the right side, secondary to facet arthropathy and ligamentum flavum infolding, as well as possibly a mild disk bulge. Her mammogram was done in 2091 which was okay. She has not had a bone mineral density at this time.  

 

MEDICATIONS: Currently, the medication she is on is Celebrex, Hyzaar for her blood pressure, and Darvocet for her pain.   

ALLERGIES: She states that taking Tylenol With Codeine gives her toes a burning sensation, and ibuprofen causes tinnitus.   

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: She has got high blood pressure and shoulder arthritis.  

 

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: She had a left breast biopsy which she states was not cancerous.  

 

SOCIAL/FUNCTIONAL HISTORY: She is functionally currently not working. She is taking sick time. She has not worked for the past three weeks. She is a Head Nurse and worked at The Library Corporation for the last 35 years. She states her job is medium as far as intensity of work. Functionally, her activities of daily living are limited, and she uses an assistive device.  

 

SOCIAL HISTORY: She is widowed and she has four healthy children, ages 51, 50, 48, and 46. She does not smoke or drink.   

FAMILY HISTORY: She has aunts with diabetes and brother that had an myocardial infarction at 59.  

 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: On review of systems, no fevers, chills, recent infections, bladder, thyroid problems, rash, shortness of breath, palpations, chest pain, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or bowel or bladder or sexual problems or urination difficulty.  She does have some joint pain and swelling in her shoulders and her feet occasionally. She does not have any numbness or tingling. She does have some trouble walking secondary to the pain. She does not feel fatigued and her appetite is okay and she does not feel anxious or stressed. She does have some mild trouble with sleeping, however, this has improved over the last few days.  

 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination, well-developed, well-nourished, well-groomed, normal mood and affect, but slightly anxious with movement, female in no acute distress at this time. On musculoskeletal examination of lumbar spine, flexion was within normal limits. Extension she had her type of pain at about 10-20 degrees. Side-bending was unremarkable. On hip examination she had some decreased internal rotation on the right when compared to the left. Straight leg raise bilaterally was negative, however, supine, slight guarding on the right.  Femoral stretch was positive on the right but not on the left. On neurological examination, as far as motor examination, there is some slight decrease, half a grade, quadriceps and hip flexors; however, this was functional; otherwise unremarkable on the right or the left. Her reflexes were 2 plus in the achilles. Babinskis were downgoing, 1 plus at the patella on the right, and 2 plus on the left. Sensory examination slightly decreased at L3 on the right; however, normal throughout; otherwise, gait was antalgic on the right and she did not want to bear weight.  

 

IMPRESSION:  

1. Right L3 acute radiculopathy secondary to herniated disk and facet arthropathy.  

2. Functional limitations secondary to pain, causing her functional weakness.  

 

RECOMMENDATIONS:  

1. Transforaminal epidural steroid injection at L3 and L4 on the right.  

2. Physical therapy after her injection.  

3. Continue her medications of Darvocet and Celebrex.  4. Keep her out of work until she is able to receive the injection, as well as continue with her physical therapy to improve her strength, given her acute radiculopathy.   

The patient was seen and examined with Dr. Xayasane, who agrees with the plan above.

 Time of visit: 6/03/2097, 1330 hours
Time of note: 1630 hours

Patient seen and examined with the team.  Note of Dr. Ellis reviewed, findings confirmed.  Available electronic notes reviewed, X-rays reviewed, labs reviewed.  

73 y. o. woman who has worked as a nurse at TLC for 40 years.  Nonsmoker.  History of hypertension treated with Hyzaar.  Current illness began 5-6 months ago with fatigue, dyspnea on exertion that has progressed to the point that she has to stop to catch her breath after walking up only 4-5 steps in a stairwell.  She finds it difficult to get started on her work because of fatigue.  She has had a cough that initially produced yellowish, ""slimy"" sputum, but more recently has been dry.  She notes occasional wheezing.  She also noted muscle and joint pain involving the shoulders and lower extremities over the past 5-6 months that she attributed to ""arthritis"".  No polyuria, but has noted nocturia X2 for the past 5-6 months. During the same period of time, has noted very dry mouth. No abdominal pain, but some difficulty with constipation for the past two weeks.

Appetite diminished and she lost about 30 pounds.  She noted a nodule on the extensor surface of the left elbow that her PCP ""cut into"" recently.  She has also noted a nodule on the dorsal surface of the right foot that seems to ""get larger"".  

She experienced substernal chest pain with radiation to the back that lasted several hours, prompting her to come to the ER.  No associated diaphoresis, nausea.  Pain somewhat better with sitting up.  

Of note, she has known of having a cardiac murmur for many years.  

Exam:  Pleasant black woman in no distress.  BP 158/79, Pulse 80, regular; O2 sat 98% on room air.  Afebrile.  Skin darkly pigmented nodule left elbow extensor surface, similar nodule right dorsal foot just proximal to 4th/5th toe.  No other rashes.  HEENT:  pale conjunctivae, anicteric.  No nasal findings, no facial skin findings (specifically, no lupus pernio).  Dry mucous membranes.  Neck: small, soft, mobile 0.5 cm node left anterior cervical chain.  Chest:  inspiratory crackles at both bases.  Cardiac: No JVD.  Regular rhythm.  III/VI (I do not feel a thrill) harsh nearly holosystolic murmur heard throughout the precordium, but especially prominent at the RUSB with radiation to the clavicles, neck.  Also heard at the apex and radiates to the left mid-back (?same murmur).  The murmur intensifies when she stands.  No gallops.  No rub.  Abdomen soft and nontender.  No spleen tip.  Liver edge not palpable.  
Lymph nodes:  fullness below the left axilla, although not confident of discrete nodes.  

Data:  There is considerable testing available to us from her recent visits to the Walk-In Clinic and to Dr. Utter.  

A CXR from 5/2097 shows bilateral hilar adenopathy, mediastinal adenopathy, and interstitial infiltrates.

Serum angiotensin converting enzyme 68 (7-46 U/L)
LDH 354

EKG:  ST elevations V1-3.

Problems:

1.  Dyspnea on exertion, progressive.
2.  Interstitial lung disease.
3.  Bilateral hilar adenopathy
4.  Weight loss
5.  Symptomatic hypercalcemia
		Nocturia
		Arthralgias
		Constipation
		Fatigue
6.  Prominent systolic murmur(s?). Changes with maneuvers suggest this may be secondary to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.  There was evidence to suggest this on an echo from 2085, but obviously, need more recent data.
7.  Minimally elevated troponins.  Uncertain significance.
8.  Anemia, mildly microcytic.
9.  Elevated LDH.
10.  Renal insufficiency, likely secondary to uncontrolled hypercalcemia.
11.  History of hypertension.

Discussion:

Sarcoidosis, until proven otherwise.  She is obviously older than typical presentation of sarcoidosis, but she had previous lymphadenopathy that may have been a first presentation of the illness with spontaneous remission.  The lung findings, systemic symptoms, hypercalcemia, anemia, abnormal serum ACE level are all suggestive of this diagnosis.  

Her hypercalcemia is symptomatic and should be treated with volume repletion.  She should not receive diuretics at present.  Long term treatment will be dependent on the underlying diagnosis and its treatment.  I think she will need corticosteroids for her sarcoidosis and I expect this will improve the hypercalcemia, but we need definitive diagnosis first.  

The cardiac murmur is impressive, but likely unrelated to the pulmonary disease.  We need echocardiogram to better define valvular function.  The minimally elevated troponins are not felt to be of clinical significance at this point.  Appreciate Cardiology input on this finding.  

Suggest:

1.  Stop HCTZ,avoid diuretics until fully volume repleted.
2.  IV normal saline.  May need rates in the 150-200 range to control her hypercalcemia acutely, but she has had this for some time, so can be conservative with fluids approach.
3.  Agree with check PTH, vitamin D levels.
4.  Follow lytes, creatinine, calcium, Hct.
5.  Agree with check echocardiogram.
6.  We should ask the Pulmonary Service to see her in consultation.  Bronchoscopy with biopsy may be the best way to obtain confirmatory tissue for diagnosis of sarcoidosis.

HPI: 73 yo black woman with h/o HTN and recurrent non-malignant axillary lymphadenopathy, newly diagnosed with HOCM in the setting of fatigue, weight loss and hypercalcemia concerning for sarcoidosis during a work-up at her last admission to MEDIQUIK on 6/2-6/20/97. At that time, the patient noted that 3-4 mo PTA she had experienced worsening fatigue and dry mouth, as well as poor oral intake with associated 30 lb weight loss. 

In early May, she presented to the walk-in clinic with these complaints and a CXR showed increased interstitial markings and mediastinal lymphadenopathy subsequently confirmed by CT. A PET CT showed FDG avidity in multiple enlarged thoracic and axillary nodes. The patient was seen at the lymphoma center by Dr. Utter, and concern was raised for multiple processes including sarcoid, lupus-like syndromes, Castleman's, and indolent lymphoma. Labs drawn at different times in recent past were notable for a Ca of 11.8 with Alb of 3.5, a mild tranaminitis in the 40s, LDH of 354, ACE of 68, normal TSH, HCT of 30.2, ESR of 85, SPEP with diffuse gamma globulin increase, positive ANA at 1:2560 with nuclear pore staining (highly specific for biliary cirrhosis), elevated B2MG at 17.5, and elevated kappa and lambda free light chains at 66 and 83.5, respectively and negative HIV. The patient   s hypercalcemia was treated with IVF, lasix at times, and a dose of bisphosphonate, which led to a decrease in Ca to 10.1.

Axillary lymph node biopsy 6/08/97 revealed non-specific follicular hyperplasia, though to be consistent with a reactive process. Oncology was consulted, and a lymphoma work-up was pursued; flow cytometry revealed polyclonal CD19+ B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with no evidence for a monoclonal B or unusual T cell population. Repeat CT examination of the chest revealed no change in the bilateral axillary, mediastinal, and hilar lymphadenopathy and offered no further clues to diagnostic possibilities.  The patient underwent pulmonary function testing, which showed a reduction in the FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC ratio; total lung capacity and subdivisions were normal, resistance and specific conductance were normal, and single breath diffusion capacity was reduced. On 7/19/97, a bronchoscopy was attempted, but the patient was unable to tolerate the procedure, and it was not performed. Thoracic surgery was consulted and recommended that the patient be evaluated in the outpatient setting for biopsy under general anesthesia. Fungal antibodies were sent, and a trial of steroids was not attempted during hospitalization. 
 
Since discharge, the pt reports that she continues to feel very fatigued, and has not    felt like eating.    She reports significant acid reflux, saying    only water goes down    and a lack of appetite with very dry mouth. She notes continued weight loss of 15lbs since leaving the hospital, tolerating little more than 1-2 cans of Ensure/day per her family. She further denies N/V, diarrhea, fever/chills/dizziness or recent infection. Of note, she has been drinking little, but urinating 9-10 times a day, clear urine with large volumes. She has not had a bowel movement for several days. She has continued her medications as instructed at the time of discharge.

In addition, her family notes a dramatic change in her mood and activity level since prior to hospitalization. She used to be very active, working nearly every day and keeping up her household. She now spends most of her day in bed sleeping, relying on her children for help and awakening early in the AM unintentionally. She has felt too tired to pursue her usual nightly bingo game. She denies suicidal ideation, saying she has her four grandchildren to liver for.
   
ED COURSE: At the ED, the patient was afebrile, HR 59, BP 136/61, RR 16, O2 Sat 95%. She was given IVF and labs were drawn.

ECG: NSR @ 82bpm, LVH unchanged from prior study


Impression: 
73F h/o newly dx HOCM, chronic systemic LAD, fatigue, and weight loss concerning for sarcoid vs. PBC vs. neoplasm, presenting with acute renal failure in setting of little PO intake and likely hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia (as in vitamin D excess secondary to sarcoid) can cause polyuria via osmotic diuresis, with dehydration, anorexia, constipation, and PUD, fatigue and depression. This would thus represent a unifying diagnosis for this pt   s anorexia and acute renal failure, which is most likely prerenal.

Plan: 
ARF: - f/u Ca + Phos. Expect Ca to be high, Phos to be low. Cont IVF
   - Cre 2.2   1.8 (bl 1.2-15) s/p IVF 500cc x1, on D5    NS @ 100cc/hr, re-evaluate and re-bolus in AM
          - Maintain good UO, no Foley b/c recording stricts I   s + O   s, 700cc out of clear urine O/N
Fatigue/Weight Loss/LAD/lack of appetite: 
-prior labs somewhat concerning for PBC, esp with elev AlkP
-f/u anti-mitochondrial Ab, TSH, f/u pending labs from prior w/u
-consider re-attempting transbronchial biopsy, revisit w/ thoracics 
Anemia: -Hct stable, slightly microcytic. MVI

Internal Medicine B Admission Note


PATIENT: Goldy Wilhelm 
MRN:     9543443
ADMIT DATE:  12/15/97
ATTENDING: Gregory Thomson
PCP:   Casey Frey
CONTACT:  Gracen Logan (HCP, daughter) 625-248-3647; Flowers (son) 705-690-8475

CC:  N/V, poor PO intake
HPI: Ms. Wilhelm is a 74 year-old woman with a history of HOCM, HTN, DM, and sarcoidosis who underwent a Hartmann&#8217;s procedure with small bowel resection on 10/18 after which she was discharged to Harton Center on 11/07 and then re-admitted to MEDIQUIK on 11/17 with left-sided pleuritic chest pain and a saddle pulmonary embolus as well as large right lower extremity DVT.  She had an IVC filter placed and was started on anticoagulation and discharged again to Harton Center on 12/1 and now presents with nausea, vomiting, and several days of poor PO intake.  This is actually her fifth admission to MEDIQUIK this year &#8211; first in June when she was diagnosed with HOCM and then in July when she was started on empiric steroids for sarcoidosis.  She says her appetite has never returned to normal since her surgery (although her July admission note also documented malaise and poor appetite) and that she has had some mild nausea on a daily basis since her surgery.  The nausea and her fatigue became worse four or five days prior to admission and since then she has been vomiting many times a day.  The nausea is not related to meals and she has not noted any blood in the emesis.  She has had poor intake as a result of the nausea and has only had broth over the last few days.  She denies fevers, chills, headaches, cough, abdominal pain, or change in the character of her colostomy output.  


ED COURSE:  
On arrival to the ED, vitals were as follows: 98, 164/84, 84, 24, 98%/RA.  Her abdomen was non-tender and minimally distended.  CT of the abdomen was concerning for a distal small bowel obstruction although no focal transition point was identified.  She was seen by surgery and an NGT was placed.  She was given 2L of IVF and morphine 2mg IV x2.   


ROS
As above, otherwise reports baseline blurry vision (has been told of cataracts in the past). Denies SOB, cough, CP, chest pressure, orthopnea, palpitations.
Foley catheter in place but denies suprapubic tenderness.

     ADRENALS: No adrenal nodules.
     KIDNEYS/URETERS: No hydronephrosis, stones, or solid mass lesions. Two left renal exophytic lesions are identified, stable in size compared with the prior examination and consistent with renal cysts.
     PELVIC ORGANS/BLADDER: There is a Foley catheter in place. There is a fibroid uterus.
     
     PERITONEUM / RETROPERITONEUM: No free air is seen.  There is trace free fluid.
     LYMPH NODES: No lymphadenopathy.
     VESSELS: There are scattered vascular calcifications. An IVC filter is in place.
     GI TRACT: There is diffuse dilation of the proximal and mid small bowel with multiple air fluid levels.  There are loops of nondilated distal small bowel and the colon is not dilated.  There has been a prior  a prior colostomy. There is diverticulosis.
     BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: Unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for distal small bowel obstruction though no discrete transition point is identified.  Alternately, this could reflect ileus.  Close clinical follow up advised.   




EKG: NSR at 94bpm, leftward axis, biatrial enlargement, normal PR interval, narrow QRS, LVH, TWIs in I, aVL


ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN
Ms. Wilhelm is a 74 year-old woman with a history of HOCM, hypertension, sarcoidosis, diabetes, who underwent a Hartmann&#8217;s procedure with small bowel resection on 10/18 and was re-admitted on 11/17 with a saddle PE and large RLE DVT for which she was managed with IVC filter and anticoagulation who now presents with several days of nausea and vomiting and concern for small bowel obstruction on CT.  



SBO: Her clinical presentation and CT findings are concerning for small bowel obstruction (although ileus remains a possibility.  Lactate was within normal limits so small bowel ischemia unlikely.  Also abdominal exam remains benign at this time.  

Appreciate surgery input
NGT to low wall suction
NPO except meds for bowel rest
Serial abdominal exams
Check colostomy output guaiac
Acute renal failure: Her creatinine was up from a baseline of 1.0 to 2.1 on admission.  With IVF hydration in the ED it has already started to come down to 1.8 so it was likely pre-renal in the setting of poor intake and vomiting.  

Continue IVF while NPO
Will trend Cr and pursue further ARF work-up if not down on AM labs
Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in low 30s, last 32.6 prior to discharge on 11/30.  She does not appear to have an active source of bleeding and her bilirubin is within normal limits so she is unlikely to be hemolyzing.  She likely either has iron-deficiency anemia (although she has been taking iron supplements) or anemia of chronic disease &#8211; or a combination thereof.  Her RDW is only mildly elevated which likely indicates inappropriately low hematopoiesis.  

Transfuse 1U PRBCs
Check colostomy guaiac
Check iron studies, reticulocyte count
Elevated INR/hypercoagulability: She is baseline hypercoagulable with lupus anticoagulant and has had the recent large DVT/PE s/p IVC filter placement.  She comes in with an elevated INR and is likely supratherapeutic on her coumadin.  She does not need to be reversed as she does not seem to be actively bleeding.

Hold Coumadin for now
Follow up INR, goal 2-3
HOCM/HTN: 

Continue lopressor, verapamil
Sarcoid:

Continue Prednisone at 5mg daily
PAF

Continue Amiodarone &#8211; follow-up with PCP regarding indication for Amio


F/E/N:  NPO
PPX: coumadin, PPI, bowel regimen


CODE:  Full

Internal Medicine G Intern Admission Note

PATIENT:  Wilhelm, Goldy

MRN: 9543443

ADMIT DATE: 8/2/98

PCP:  Dr. Casey Frey



HPI: 74F with sarcoidosis, HTN, CHF, HOCM, PE s/p IVC filter now on coumadin, PVD s/p L BKA, and DM who presents from her rehab facility with failure to thrive and increasing lethargy for several weeks. Of note, pt had recent admission to MEDIQUIK (6/29-7/05) at which time she presented with similar complaints of fatigue/lethargy and routine CBC demonstrated an elevated WBC (15) and low Hct (23). She was ultimately found to have an Enterococcus bacteremia and intra-abdominal abscess that grew out E. coli. She underwent IR drainage of the abdominal collection and completed a course of Vanc/CTX. Outpatient f/u abd CT (7/18) showed near complete resolution of the intra-abdominal collection. Since that time, however, pt&#8217;s sons report increasing lethargy at her nursing facility. Patient has no complaints. Specifically, she denies fatigue, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, motor weakness and fevers and chills. However, given concern on the part of her sons, pt was taken to the MEDIQUIK ED. 



In the MEDIQUIK ED, she was afebrile with HR 70, BP 150/74, RR 24, and Sa02 100% RA.

Imaging: 

CXR (8/2/98): 1.  Increased interstitial markings may represent worsened mild pulmonary edema or interstitial infection.



Abd CT (7/18/98): Near complete resolution of previously seen left lower quadrant fluid collection. Stable small cystic lesions in pancreas which likely represent side branch IPMN.



Abd CT (6/30/98): New 4.8 x 4.0 cm thick walled fluid collection in the LLQ which contains a small amount of gas.  This would be amenable to percutaneous drainage. Small bilateral pleural effusions, decreased in size. Bilateral benign renal cysts. Gallbladder wall calcifications.



A/P: 74F with sarcoidosis, HTN, CHF, HOCM, PE s/p IVC filter now on coumadin, PVD s/p L BKA, and DM who presents from her rehab facility with failure to thrive and increasing lethargy for several weeks. 



1. Failure to thrive / lethargy: The etiology of this pt&#8217;s lethargy is unclear. It is notable, however, that her presentation on this admission is very similar to her presentation in July at which time she was found to be bacteremic with an additional intra-abdominal bacterial collection. At present, there is no clear source of infection, although her urinalysis is suspicious for a UTI. Elevated WBC in someone on chronic steroids is concerning for infection, but pt is hemodynamically stable and afebrile. In addition to bacteremia, UTI and re-accumulation of an intra-abdominal collection, other possible causes of her lethargy include toxic/metabolic causes (such as uremia), anemia, or depression. 

                - F/u blood,  urine, and respiratory cultures

                - Will hold off on empirically starting abx based on urinalysis (If we were to start abx, would 

                 recommend vanc/cefepime given micro history)

- Culture if spikes

                - Consider repeat abd imaging if pt continues to have a leukocytosis and doesn&#8217;t clinically 

                 improve



2. Anemia &#8211; Source of anemia has been unclear in the past. During last admission, pt was found to be guaiac positive on rectal exam but guaiac negative out of colostomy. GI at that time had deferred colonoscopy. It is possible that her anemia may be responsible for her failure to thrive. 

                - Type and screen

                - Will transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs and monitor for clinical improvement

                - Check post-transfusion Hct 



3. HTN &#8211; pt has long-standing refractory hypertension despite numerous anti-hypertensive agents

                - Per pharmacy recommendations, holding propranolol given h/o SOB

                - Continue clonidine, verapimil and hydral (titrate as needed)

4. Elevated INR &#8211; pt has a supratherapeutic INR. Given that pt is near discharge Hct from previous admission, do not feel that she is actively bleeding. As such, do not feel the need to actively reverse her. 

                - Monitor daily INRs

                - Hold warfarin overnight



5. Renal insufficiency &#8211; Cr 1.58 today (baseline 1.2). Likely secondary to prerenal 

                - Fluid resuscitation 

                - Recheck lytes in AM

Neurology resident consult note
 


Patient Name:      Leon

MRN:                      43634211

Date:                      0021

Consult reason:  
?abnormal gait



HPI:  53RHM who going to bed Wednesday was in usoh, but Thursday 2:30AM awoke w/ terrible HA, so came to ED; got CT head and LP, both negative for blood. However, BP was reportedly as high as 190/106 (and wife says she&#8217;s measured it this high at home at least once in past 2 weeks), and blood glucose 400s. I see no LMR note about the visit, but am told that he was given some medication for his BP, given some insulin and a Rx for insulin, and instructed to see his PCP the next day, and discharged. Friday he did see his PCP, who told him not to take insulin but to take oral DM meds instead, and told him to return to the ED b/c he still had a terrible HA, so he came back to the EDUCARE-PULLMAN ED tonight. He was given caffeine, ibuprofen, Tylenol, and compazine, reported that his HA was gone. However, a staff physician in the ED on exam noted a wide based gait. An MRI was originally ordered, but canceled when it came to notice that he has an implanted device to prevent syncope that precludes MRI. Neurology is now consulted.to comment on his gait and other sx. 



Patient and his wife tell me that his gait is baseline, and has been as it is for years; they have noticed no change and have no complaints. 

He is very unpleasant and un-forthcoming about his history, slow to cooperate w/ exam; says he wants to go home, resents being in the ED still now that his HA is gone. 



VS in ED tonight: BP 172/95 max, but mostly 150-160s; temp 98, hr 89, 100% RA

Blood glucose not measured tonight. 



ROS: 

Negative for: changes in vision or hearing, neck pain, tinnitus, vertigo, weakness, numbness, difficulty with comprehension, speaking, language, swallowing, eating, balance or gait. 

General review of systems negative for:  fevers, chills, rashes, change in weight, energy level or appetite, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and change in bowel or bladder habits (i.e incontinence). 



MEDS: metoprolol, omeprazole, simvastatin (he is unsure whether this is all)

ALL: nkda

PMH: 

-HTN; he denies prior dx of DM before yesterday night

-recurrent cardiogenic syncope, for which he has had &#8220;Reveal&#8221; device implanted, then explanted b/c of pain, then recurrent sycope and reimplantation of device, after which syncope stopped (see notes in LMR from Dr. Susan Root)



SH: denies t/e/d, works as &#8220;Pipefitter&#8221;

FH: HTN, DM



Neurologic Examination: 

MS: unpleasant, uncooperative w/ history, angry about being in the ED still

AOx3, appropriately interactive and conversational. Normal affect. 

Speech is fluent with intact comprehension and repetition, no paraphasic errors. 

Concentration and attention intact. 

CN: Visual fields full to confrontation; pupils equal and reactive 3&gt;2 direct and concensual; no ptosis; 

Extraocular movements full without nystagmus; facial sensation to LT normal. 

Hearing intact to finger rub bilaterally; face, tongue and palate are symmetric; SCM and traps 5/5.

Motor: Normal bulk and tone; no tremor, rigidity, or bradykinesia. No pronator drift. Finger tapping normal.

Sensory: Intact/symmetric LT/PP/T/JPS throughout.   

Reflexes: absent throughout. 


Cerebellar: Finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements, heel-knee-shin normal and symmetric b/l.

Gait: Slightly wide based. Normal arm swing, normal speed. Able to walk on toes and heels. Some difficulty w/ tandem walk. Negative Romberg. 



A/P:  53RHM w/ HTN urgency yesterday, newly diagnosed DM w/ FS in 300-400s yesterday, who yesterday presented w/ new HA and negative w/u for SAH, now back again for same HA, which has finally resolved in apparently in concert w/ some improvement in BP (current BP 150s) and w/ medications. Neurology was specifically consulted for his gait, which does appear a bit wide-based, but he and wife confirm that this is chronic, and I strongly doubt any relation to his current HA problems. Most obvious medical issues to focus on here are his poorly controlled HTN, which I suspect is the primary cause of his HA, and his uncontrolled DM, of which he obviously does not yet understand the import and does not seem likely to comply with insulin treatment without further education. 



In any case, I find no acute neurological issues. 



Recs: 

-BP management

-DM management. 



Thanks for this interesting consult. 

Case/plan discussed w/ KEKELA neurology attending by phone, Dr. Ivan Guy. 

Call w/ questions 86383.

Addendum: 

He did not mention this when I questioned him and wife about PMH, but digging through prior LMR notes I find this addition to his PMH: 

A note from Dr. Robert Irish, neurosurgery, from 3/2099 notes that he is s/p &#8220;cervical laminectomy and foramen magnum resection followed by removal of an intramedullary tumor near his foramen magnum.  He is doing much better today.  He states that his headaches are considerably better, and the left hemibody dysesthesias are much better tolerated since the initiation of Neurontin.&#8221;",,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

MULLINS,DOLORES U   728-41-92-0               VISIT DATE: 01/24/73

This patient was seen, interviewed and examined by myself as well 

as Dr. Hawkins whose note I reviewed and with which I agree.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 70-year-old female who 

presents with inability to control her left arm and left leg.  The 

patient had onset of her symptoms approximately two hours prior to 

arrival.  The patient denies any change in sensation but she 

definitely did notice weakness with decreased ability to control 

her left side extremities.  The patient states that her left arm 

control was regained after approximately one or two hours.  Her 

left leg control is better but still is not back to baseline.  

Review of systems, family history and social history as per the 

resident's note.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, 

hypertension.

MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Diltiazem, labetalol.

ALLERGIES:  TETANUS.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a well-developed, well-nourished 

female, in mild distress, appears concerned.  Temperature is 96.9 

degrees, pulse 65, respiratory rate of 18, blood pressure is 

163/104.  Repeat blood pressure is 174/80.  Oxygen saturation is 

97% on room air.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are 

equally round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular 

motions are intact.  No nystagmus.  NECK:  Supple with full range 

of motion.  2+ carotids, no bruits.  CARDIAC:  Regular rate and 

rhythm.  EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Extremities 

are nontender to palpation throughout.  NEURO:  Alert, oriented x 

3.  Follows commands, appropriate.  Cranial nerves II-XII are 

intact.  There is 5/5 motor strength in individual motor group 

testing of the upper extremities and lower extremities bilaterally. 

The patient is unable to stand without assistance.  Comprehension 

is within normal limits.  Further details of the physical 

examination are as per the resident's note.

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Labs are significant for a glucose of 162, 

BUN of 20, creatinine 1.3, sodium 145, potassium 4.2, chloride 108, 

bicarb 26, calcium 9.4.  White count is 8.1, hematocrit 39.0, 

platelets 341.  A UA shows no blood, no leucocyte esterase, no 

ketones.  Head CT shows no acute intracranial abnormality and mild 

involutional changes.  EKG shows a sinus rhythm at 57 beats per 

minute with non-specific T wave changes.  This is compared to an 

EKG from 2068 and was found to be without significant change.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen and evaluated 

in the Emergency Department with labs and studies obtained as 

documented above.  The initial concerns were for a focal seizure 

versus a TIA.  The patient was hypertensive on her arrival and, 

therefore, received labetalol for improved blood pressure control 

and the Neurology Service was consulted early in the patient's 

care.  The patient does not have any evidence of focal motor group 

weakness at this time, nor sensation changes.  The patient will 

require admission to the Neurology Service for further workup of 

her seizure versus TIA.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  TIA.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 

admitted to the hospital in satisfactory condition.

Rheumatology Consult Note

Name: Mullins, Dolores U
MRN: 72841920
DOB: 06/06/02
Location: 78Q-47-4
Consult date: 09/01/79
Referring Physician: Gay Langley
Source of history: patient interview, medical records
Code status: Full

Reason for Consult: bilateral LE pain up to knees
HPI:
77 yo F w/h/o type I DM and HTN.  At the beginning of this year, she began to have intermittent    burning    pain of her feet and sometimes her lower legs/feet.  This pain typically occurred on one leg more than the other, without an overall predominance of one side.  In the past month, she has had continuous, bilateral    burning    pain that began in both feet.  Several weeks ago, her pain worsened considerably such that she was having difficulty shopping.  Around this time, the pain spread up her legs to above her knees.  She also noted having difficulty putting on shoes and was told by a friend that her feet were swollen (she is unable to see her feet due to blindness).  Her pain continued to worsen until the night prior to admission, when she was in her bathroom and found herself in such pain that she was unable to get up to leave the bathroom.  A friend found her after 8 hours and EMS was called.  In the ED, she was found to have BP elevated to 190, Cr elevated to 2.8, FSG down to 51, and R-sided hydronephrosis.  Labetolol/diltiazem were given for HTN with good response, IV hydration was given with subsequent decline in Cr, and Foley was placed with resolution of hydronephrosis on subsequent MRI.   

She has never had    burning    pain of the kind that she presented with prior to this year.  Of note, she has had    years    of tingling without numbness in her lower extremities bilaterally extending to above her knees.  She also notes numbness of the tips of her R 2nd-4th digits.  ROS positive for subjective decline in urine output and constipation (1 BM/2days).  She denies fever/chills/sweats, recent weight loss, fatigue, hypoglycemic episodes, cough/rhinorrhea/sore throat, SOB, orthpnea, CP, palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, polyuria/polydipsia.

A/P: 77 yo F w/h/o DM and HTN who presented with several weeks of worsening bilateral LE burning pain exacerbated by movement and pressure.  She was found to have exquisitely tender joints up to and including her knees with visible synovial effusions of her knees bilaterally.  Aspiration of one of her knees revealed needle-shaped negatively birefringent crystals, diagnostic of gout.  This is consistent with her elevated uric acid and her elevated markers of inflammation (ESR/CRP).  Given that she has a long history of symptoms of LE diabetic neuropathy and that she has some diffuse soft tissue tenderness, she may also have some pain from diabetic neuropathy that may declare itself after her gout is treated.  However, her current inability to walk can be clearly attributed to gout.  

Recs:

- Colchicine po 0.6 mg qd for 2 weeks, then 0.6 mg qod for 2 weeks
- Continue to hold HCTZ     discuss with PCP need to restart as outpatient as it is a risk factor for hyperuricemia
- F/u with rheumatology in 4 weeks for initiation of allopurinol (please arrange appointment w/ Dr. Yau)



Procedure: R knee aspiration
Patient was informed of the risks of bleeding and infection and gave consent. The medial aspect of the right knee was sterilized using iodine swabs x3, sterile gloves used in a one-handed sterile lateral approach. 1.5cc of 1% lidocaine was injected to raise a wheal inferior to the R patella. A 18G needle was inserted into the knee and approximately 20cc of opaque, yellow fluid was withdrawn. A slide was prepared and examined under the microscope by myself, Dr. Yau, and Dr. Woodard.  Abundant intracellular and extracellular needle-shapped negatively birefringent crystals were observed.  Synovial fluid sample was also submitted for culture, Gram stain, cell count, and crystal analysis.

I saw this patient with Dr. Xavier Palacios.  I confirm that I have

interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's

documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the

evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient. 

Please see the resident's note for further details.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fast heart rate.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old female

with history of a left MCA stroke, atrial fibrillation,

hypertension, diabetes, and renal insufficiency who was

transferred from Southwest Montana Radiology for atrial

fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  The patient has

been in Southwest Montana for the last several weeks.  During her

rehabilitation stay, the patient was noted to have sinus

bradycardia and sinus pauses.  The patient's metoprolol was

stopped.  The patient was previously on metoprolol 6.25 mg every

6 hours.  The patient was noted to have atrial fibrillation with

rapid ventricular response on exam this morning.  The patient is

followed by Dr. Octavia Xue of Heritage Hospital Cardiology. 

Given the difficulty that Southwest Montana has had ____

the patient's atrial fibrillation, the patient was transferred

here to Riverton General Hospital for further management and

further placement.  The patient is asymptomatic.  The patient

denies any chest pain or shortness of breath.  The patient denies

any lightheadedness.  The patient has no other complaints.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's vital signs revealed the

following:  Temperature is 96.4, heart rate of 79, respiratory

rate of 18, blood pressure is 112/63, and oxygen saturations at

100% on room air.  The patient's oxygen saturation was

interpreted as normal.  General:  No acute distress, pleasant,

and multiple family members at bedside.  HEENT:  The patient's

head was normocephalic.  Mucous membranes were dry.  Posterior

oropharynx was clear.  Neck:  Supple.  No carotid bruits.  No

JVD.  Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No focal

rhonchi, rales, or wheezes.  Cardiovascular:  Irregularly

irregular, tachycardic.  No gross murmurs, rubs, or gallops were

appreciated.  GI:  Abdomen:  Soft.  No rebound or guarding. 

Minimal suprapubic tenderness to palpation.  G-tube in place. 

Rectal exam:  Deferred.  GU exam:  Deferred.  Skin:  Warm and

dry.  No rash or lesions were noted.  Back:  No costovertebral

angle tenderness.  Extremities:  Warm and well perfused.  Lower

extremity pitting edema rising up to the knees.  No palpable

cords.  Neurologic:  The patient was alert and oriented.  The

patient moved all 4 extremities with fair strength.  The patient

did have a right facial droop.  I did not ambulate the patient.

INITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  The patient is a 78-year-old female

with history of atrial fibrillation, and recent left MCA stroke

who was transferred from Southwest Montana for management

of her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  The

patient is hemodynamically stable at this time.  The patient is

asymptomatic.  The patient will need rate control and will need

to be admitted to Heritage Hospital Cardiology.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Upon arrival to the Emergency

Department, the patient had history and physical exam performed. 

The patient then had 12-lead EKG performed.  The patient's

12-lead EKG was notable for atrial fibrillation with rapid

ventricular response.  The patient did have some nonspecific ST-T

changes when compared to her prior EKG.  The patient's laboratory

studies so far has been largely unremarkable.  The patient's

first set of cardiac markers were negative.  The patient's

complete blood count was notable for an elevated white blood cell

count of 10.8.  The patient's hematocrit of 33.2.  The patient's

platelets were somewhat elevated at 560,000.  The patient's

portable chest x-ray has been ordered and results of the

patient's portable chest x-ray are still pending at this time. 

The case was then discussed with the Heritage Hospital

cardiologist on call.  The patient ____ will be admitted to

Heritage Hospital Cardiology and to a monitor bed.  I did try to

page Dr. Octavia Xue to let her know about the patient's

admission to Heritage Hospital Cardiology.  The patient and

patient's family were in agreement with the plan.  The patient

was started on metoprolol down her G-tube.  The patient had a

good response to the metoprolol.  The patient was given

metoprolol 6.25 mg.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSES:

1.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

2.  History of a left MCA stroke.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was admitted to Heritage Hospital

Cardiology.

CONDITION AT TIME OF DISPOSITION:  Stable and satisfactory.

077-765-3083                     04/03/2143


DATE OF BIRTH:  09/12/81.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 61-year-old ambidextrous female is referred by Dr. Orellana for followup of possible stroke or TIA.  The patient is interviewed and available records are reviewed.  In February, she developed left leg weakness on arising one morning.  There was also some possible ataxia of the left upper extremity with decreased control of both the arm and the leg.  This seemed to occur for two days in a row and on one occasion, she fell getting out of bed.  The symptoms resolved before she could be evaluated.  She attributed the symptoms to not enough air pressure in her air mattress and once this was corrected, she feels that the event has not re-occured.

The second event was apparently associated with some left facial weakness as well.

She was seen by Neurology on 02/10/43 after she was admitted.  The history includes also lightheadedness and foggy vision per that report.  Initially MRI of the head showed no acute events but did show a change in the right posterior cerebral artery and a lesion in the left temporal lobe.  Also, in the record is noted that at the time of the second event, her glucose was very low at around 32 and symptoms resolved after treatment with D50.  There was also further history that the patient had been seeing a chiropractor for treatment of neck pain in the several months leading up to the event.

On examination at the time of admission, there were no clear findings.  MRI was said to show periventricular white matter changes.  The area of abnormality adjacent to the left lateral ventricle was thought to perhaps represent an old prior small hemorrhage.  MRA of the brain showed absence of visualization of the right PCA about 1 cm beyond its origin but MRA of the neck showed no significant changes.  Subsequent echocardiogram showed mild LVH with no evidence of a shunt.

Currently, the patient is asymptomatic and presents for routine followup.  It has been unclear what the cause of her symptoms was.  Some have attributed the symptoms to hypoglycemia and another formulation was that of a thalamic TIA given the changes in the right PCA on MRA.  Another consideration was dissection from manipulation by the chiropractor.  There is no clinical history to go with the possible old small hemorrhage.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Notable for multifocal muscle aches and a chronic cough.  The patient also has some shortness of breath but there is no report of chest pain or fever or chills.  There are no medication allergies reported.

PAST FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY:  Past medical history is notable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, spinal stenosis, diabetes, depression, neuropathy, anxiety, COPD, arthritis, and sinus symptoms.

MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Lopressor, glyburide, Naprosyn, Neurontin, Paxil, Lescol, Advair, trazodone, Glucophage, and ?___?.

Not withstanding the above, the patient continues to smoke.  She uses alcohol occasionally.  She has a 12th grade education.  She lives alone and is a widow.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 148/86, pulse 83 and regular, respirations 20.  The patient is overweight.  Height is 5 foot 3 inches.  Weight is 217 pounds.  Range of motion of the neck is reduced in all quadrants, though without clear spasm.  Poor neck posture is noted.  Funduscopic examination is normal with regard to disks and vessels.  Cardiovascular testing, carotids are 2+ without bruits.  Temporal arteries are normal.  Musculoskeletal testing, gait and station show a slight slowing of gait that has been present for years.  Romberg is negative.  Tandem gait is normal.  The patient does move slowly in general, this is probably not reflective of true bradykinesia.  There is some asymmetry of the shoulders with elevation on the right compared with the left.  This affects movements of the arms and range of motion of the arms but it appears to be orthopedic in nature and not neurologic.  There is no focal muscle weakness or atrophy noted.

NEUROLOGICAL TESTING:  Mental status is essentially normal to orientation, memory, attention, language and fund of information.  Cranial nerve testing, pupils are 3 mm and briskly reactive.  Extraocular movements are full.  Visual fields are intact.  There is no facial sensory loss, but there is a mild facial asymmetry that did not look pathological.  Visual fields are intact.  Hearing is intact.  Oropharynx is normal.  Palate elevates well.  Tongue is midline.  Sensory testing shows absent vibration sensation in the feet bilaterally but sensory testing is otherwise intact.  Reflexes are absent in the lower extremities and 1+ in the upper extremities.  There is possible withdrawal at the left toe but the right toe seems downgoing.  Coordination testing today seemed intact.

Prior neurologic evaluation from 02/10/43 is reviewed.  Homocystine level was elevated at 14, normal zero to ten.  Recommended treatment included folate, pyridoxine, and B12.

IMPRESSION:  Transient neurologic symptoms, question etiology.  Comment.  I would agree with prior examiners that the symptoms probably do not relate to the position of the bed or air in the air mattress.  I do not think the symptoms are approximate enough to the chiropractic manipulation to be relevant.  Symptoms could have related to hypoglycemia or could have been vascular in nature.  In this regard, the PCA stenosis or occlusion may be relevant.  It is not immediately clear how to fit in the old hemorrhage.

PLAN:  Although, she should be on some type of antiplatelet agent.  She was on aspirin at the time of the event and therefore would be considered an aspirin failure.  We therefore suggested Plavix 75 mg daily.  We were subsequently called by the pharmacy and informed that she is already on Aggrenox.  It probably does not matter which medication she chooses; however, she should be on one or the other and not both.  For treatment of the homocysteine level elevation, we have added simply multivitamins two daily.  I am not sure how significant this finding is in relation to the above symptoms.  She is advised to watch her glucose level and adjust medicines accordingly.  We have suggested a followup in Neurology in six months.

EDVISIT^11289501^FAY, BROOK^9/18/2094^XAYSANA, YUSEF

I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the patient,

reviewed the resident's documentation on the patient's chart, and

discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the

patient and the resident, Dr. Vanburen.  Please see his note for

full details.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 67-year-old female who presents to

triage complaining of substernal chest pain, diaphoretic.  Triage

note states that she is complaining of substernal chest pain

radiating to the neck with this and diaphoresis.  She is cool and

pale.  Her triage vital signs showed pulse of 148, up to 180s. 

She was tachypneic.  Her blood pressure was unobtainable and her

sats were 90% on room air.  She is hypoxic.  She was afebrile,

temperature 96.  She was immediately brought back to room.  At

that time, she complained of palpitations, diaphoresis, and chest

pain since 10 p.m.  She has had no history of an MI.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  She does have history of hypertension,

diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She denies any tobacco or IV drugs or any other

drugs.  She lives with her family who is at her bedside.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She has had bilateral tubal ligation.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Currently, chest pain, palpitations,

diaphoresis, and shortness of breath.  Otherwise, all systems are

negative.

MEDICATIONS:  She is on metformin and Lipitor.

ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is awake, alert, in moderate distress.

 She is tachycardic to 180 in the monitor.  Her blood pressure is

not able to be obtained at this time.  Her saturations are 100%

on room air, normal interpretation.  She is alert, awake and

oriented, follows commands.  Her head is atraumatic.  Her pharynx

is normal.  Her neck is supple and nontender.  She is in no

respiratory distress with normal breath sounds.  Her heart is

tachycardic with a narrow complex tachycardia on monitor.  Her

abdomen is soft and nontender.  Her skin is intact but

diaphoretic.  Extremities are without pedal edema.  She is

oriented x3 with no cranial nerve and no motor or sensory

deficits.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  She was placed on a monitor, EKG

and received oxygen as well with this.  She was explained that

she was going to receive adenosine 6 mg and this did break her

off from her SVT.  I was present during this time.  She had an

EKG that then transformed to normal sinus rhythm at 91 with an

incomplete right bundle-branch block with no previous to compare.

 She received aspirin, Lopressor, and nitroglycerin and remained

hemodynamically stable throughout her ED stay.  For her

tachycardia and chest pain, we ruled out AFib, complex

tachycardia, pulmonary embolism, and acute coronary syndrome. 

She was admitted for telemetry as well as a cardiac rule out. 

Her white count was 12 and her hematocrit was 42.  BUN 29 and

creatinine 1.2.  The d-dimer was negative.  Troponin was

negative.  Her chest x-ray was negative.

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

1.  SVT.

2.  Chest pain, rule out acute coronary syndrome.

3.  Abnormal EKG.

CRITICAL CARE TIME:  20 minutes.

 Medicine Admission Note


Patient Name:  Fay, Brook
MRN: 11289501
Date: 9/16/96
Admitting Staff: Tellez
Location:  59H

Reason for Admission:  Dysphagia

HPI: Ms. Fay is a 69 year-old woman with diabetes who presented from home with an approximately 2 month history of progressive dysphagia, solid and liquid. About that time she was prescribed Amoxicillin and Metronidazole, presumably for H. pylori eradication (not confirmed); she reports an adverse reaction to amoxicillin with rash and facial swelling. The meds were discontinued and she started a course of oral methylprednisolone. She stopped this several weeks ago because it made her jittery. Approximately the same time she began to notice that food and pills would feel stuck in the throat; on further questioning, she also may have noted the presence of white spots in the mouth around this time as well. No fevers, chills, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, headache, lightheadedness, vertigo, rash or new joint pain; no recent travel. She does note that her blood sugars at home have been consistently elevated to the 200-300 range.

In the ED, Ms. Fay was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. She was evaluated by the GI department. A screening HIV test was negative. She was found to have mild hyponatremia and mild hyperkalemia, as well as a question of subtle ECG changes. The above findings prompted admission for further workup.

ROS: Pertinent positives and negatives above.

PMH/PSH:   
Diabetes mellitus
Hypertension
Hyperlipidemia
Obesity
GERD
Osteoarthritis and low back pain
H/o AVNRT (2094)

ALLERGIES: Reported rash and facial swelling with Amoxicillin

MEDICATIONS: 
Atenolol 50mg daily
Diclofenac 75 mg Q8 prn
Metformin 500mg PO BID
Pantoprazole 40 mg daily
Loratadine
Albuterol MDI
Meclizine 25mg PRN
Aledronate 70mg weekly

FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives alone; family heavily involved in her care and assist with secondary ADLs. No alcohol, tobacco or drug use. Born in Peru, last visit about one year ago.

PHYSICAL EXAM:	
Gen: Alert, NAD
VS:  Afebrile   82   100/54   18   100% RA
HEENT:  Conjunctivae clear, anicteric, NP clear, OP with mild thrush, upper dentures; no sinus tenderness
Neck:  Supple, no adenopathy; no palpable thyromegaly
Heart: RRR, s1s2 without murmur
Lungs: CTA bilaterally without wheeze/rales
ABD: Soft, nontender, nondistended, nabs, no mass
EXT:  Warm, no edema

130 / 5.3 / 99 / 21 / 38 / 1.1 < 375   eGFR 48
ALT/AST normal
CK/MG/Troponin normal x 2 sets
UA: 3+ glucose, otherwise negative

MICROBIOLOGY: Urine culture pending

RADIOLOGY: None

ECG: NSR, incomplete RBBB; T wave flattening/inversion in V2-V3 that was not noted on 2094 ECG

IMPRESSION and PLAN: 66 year-old woman with solid/liquid dysphagia, oral candidiasis, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. The presence of thrush raises suspicion for esophageal candidiasis, though she does not report odynophagia. Mechanical obstruction should be ruled out. The presence of mild hyponatremia and hyperkalemia is likely attributable to the fact that she abruptly discontinued exogenous corticosteroids after a several week course; she is hemodynamically stable. Finally, there is little here to suggest acute coronary syndrome, though she falls into a subgroup of patients more likely to present with minimal symptoms. ECG warrants following. Diabetes is poorly controlled and may require initiation of insulin therapy; though sugars here may have been confounded by the dose of steroids given in ED.

CV: CR monitor overnight; cycle ECG and cardiac biomarkers; aspirin, continue beta blocker
Pulm: No issues; albuterol prn
GI: Upper endoscopy tentatively planned for the morning; NPO after midnight; continue home ppi
Endocrine: Sliding scale insulin, metformin; consider diabetes education, and discuss with PCP whether initiation of insulin is warranted. Check HbA1c, TFTs
FEN: Monitor lytes; lowfat ADA diet
Infectious Disease: Following EGD, fluconazole for candidiasis; leukocytosis is unexplained, but not focal evidence of infection
PPx: Enoxaparin may be started after EGD
Social work consult to assess support network and assist with discharge planning

Terry Iyer will assume care in the morning. Please page Dr. Iyer directly at 00450 with questions arising after 8:00am.

DM- having problems with glucometer, but based on sisters measurements not too bad. ha1c has come down 0.7%.  Hopefully with better medical management will continue to drop.  Continues to have difficulty with medications. 

 

adrenal insufficiency- now off prednisone after gradual taper. 

 

lipids- back on statin, will check when due.

 

htn- high again today.  will plan to taper atenolol, as recent data show limits as treatment of hypertension, and add hctz/lisinopril, both are first line agents for htn. see back in two weeks.

 

back pain- pt appt next week

Main issue is whether his hematologic abnormalities are secondary to infection, presumably immiune-mediated, or whether there is primary hematologic disorder with worrisome WBC/diff. Has clinical bleeding as well as thrombocytopenia.  Lung abnormality may be pneumonia, but given context needs further definition--unlikely bacterial. 



I've asked Dr. Flora Cole to consult.

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Dizziness and change in mental status



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Ishida is a 78 y/o, who p/w dizziness that began 2 to 3 weeks ago. The pt says the dizziness was worsened when he stood up to walk around; noting that it was particularly bad when he was standing and concentrating on a particular task such as shaving. The dizziness was alleviated by him lying down. He added that he began feeling dizzy during the storm last week when his drinking water was contaminated.  He drank tap water until he was told it was undrinkable, then he stopped. He later developed diarrhea while not drinking any water and only having occasional Coca-cola beverages. During these 2 weeks of dizziness, Mr. Ishida notes he felt that he lost 3-4 days of his life, saying that he was either knocked out or unconscious. He came to this conclusion b/c his medication box was still full for the previous 3 days; supporting his reflection by saying he rarely ever misses his medication. Mr. Ishida states that the room was not spinning and said that his dizziness was more like &#8220;lightheadness.&#8221; He feels that his problems began when taking Tylenol- 2 weeks ago and cannot identify any other medication that is associated with his symptoms. Mr. Ishida says he&#8217;s never experienced any dizziness before, and hoped his symptoms would subside if he just stayed in bed. Mr. Ishida also described an increased pressure in his head, saying, &#8220;it felt as if my eyes and ears were going to explode.&#8221; Pt denies head trauma/falls, syncope, intoxication (from drugs or ETOH), or CP.

ASSESSMENT

Mr. Ishida is a 78 y/o M with h/o CKD, HTN, and NIDDM p/w sustained dizziness and altered mental status. Mr. Ishida is most likely currently in a volume depleted stated. He had diarrhea induced by the contaminated water from the storm and only maintained his hydration with a meager 2 or 3 bottles of Coca-cola over several days. This in combination with his output of fluid from diarrhea, his diuretic medication, and possible osmotic diuresis (increased serum glucose level from soda intake in a diabetic) could have shifted him into hypovolemia. Thus Mr. Ishida might have decrease effective arterial volume causing his BUN/Cr ratio to be elevated, indicating a prerenal process. Although BUN/Cr ratio is not &gt;20, we can still assume that he has prerenal ARF considering his use of diuretics and h/o CKD which can decrease the sensitivity of BUN/Cr rations and FENa for assessing etiologies of renal failure. Mr. Ishida additionally uses NSAIDs (e.g. Naproxen), an ARB and an ACEI, all of which are associated with decreased intraglomerular pressure and renal vasoconstriction which can lead to prerenal ARF.

Intrinsic ARF is less likely considering he is not using any overtly nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. amphotericin, cisplatin, or aminoglycosides. Conversely, he is at an increased risk of cholesterol emboli given his h/o of hypercholesterolemia and vasculopathy.

      Lastly, Mr. Ishida my have a postrenal ARF etiology considering his h/o BPH which could lead to obstruction of the outflow tract leading to increased pressures in the ureters flowing back up into the kidneys.

      Mr. Ishida&#8217;s dizziness and altered mental status are both explained by ARF. Additional explanations of altered mental status are ruled out via the history and physical including intoxication, brain hemorrhagic, brain tumor, etc.

PLAN

#) Acture Renal Failure

-Continue fluids and hydration: 1L of IV saline over the next 24 hrs

-D/c naproxen use.

-Rule out Post-renal etiology: use ultrasound to assess the size of the bladder and ureters. If enlarged bladder and ureters are found the diagnosis is more likely postrenal ARF due to an enlarged prostate. Thus the patient should be assessed by Urology of possible partial prostatectomy.



#) DM

-Discontinue metformin due to possibility of metabolic acidosis and hospital drug interactions.

#) CAD

      -Switch Atenlol to metoprolol given ARF

#) HTN

-Discontinue lisinopril, valsartan, furosemide until pt&#8217;s renal condition improves.

#) Gout

      -D/C allopurinol until pt&#8217;s renal condition improves

#)Hypercholesterolemia

-Continue simvastatin as previously prescribed (Simvastatin  20 MG PO QHS)

#) Psoriasis

-Continue Ammonium Lactate 12% Cream and Calcipotriene 0.005%   TOP BID prn

#)Benign Prostate Hypertrophy

      -Continue Finasteride and darifenacin as previously prescribed.

MASSEY,RAMONA   446-90-33-6                       VISIT DATE: 10/07/69
TIME OF DICTATION:  1 p.m. 
PRESENTING COMPLAINT and HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 
patient is a 63-year-old female who presents to the Zollman Community Clinic Emergency Department from home after the patient 
was found down by her daughter inside her home for an unspecified 
amount of time.  The paramedics and police were called the scene. 
The police were able to force open the door of the home.  The 
patient was found unconscious on the floor, having a generalized 
tonic clonic seizure.  The patient was intubated and given 4 mg of 
Ativan prior to arrival in the Emergency Department with the 
paramedics.  On arrival in the Emergency Department, the patient 
was noted to be comatose, intubated, and clearly in acute distress. 
The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus.  She has had a 
seizure in the past, apparently secondary to hypoglycemia.  She 
also has a history of high blood pressure.  She is on diltiazem, 
lisinopril, and medications for hypercholesterolemia. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature is 100.6 degrees F., her 
pulse 150, her respiratory rate 12, her blood pressure on arrival 
205/90, and her O2 saturation is 98%.  On physical examination, the 
HEENT examination reveals a normocephalic head with no evidence of 
trauma on examination.  The pupils are equal and round, weakly 
reactive to light.  The pupils are 2 mm.  The fundi cannot be 
visualized.  The neck is supple.  There are no step-offs noted. 
The chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The heart has 
normal S1 and S2, no S3 or S4, and no murmur.  The abdomen is 
protuberant, but soft and non-tender, without guarding, rebound, 
masses, or organomegaly.  The extremities are grossly within normal 
limits.  Grossly, there is no posturing; there are no Babinskis; 
the reflexes are about 1+ bilaterally. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The head CT is noted to be negative.  The 
EKG reveals ST elevations in III and possibly aVF.  The heart rate 
is approximately 130.  The chest x-ray shows proper tube placement. 
The troponin I is 2.2, and is in the process of being repeated. 
The glucose is 174, the BUN 57, the creatinine 5.8, the sodium 137, 
the potassium 5.3, the chloride 101, the CO2 18.  The CK is noted 
to be 920, and the CK-MB is 2.6%.  The toxicology screen is 
negative.  The troponin I again is 2.2.  The urine toxicology is 
also noted to be negative.  The white count is 14, the hemoglobin 
11, the hematocrit 36, and the platelet count 350.  The urinalysis 
shows 3+ blood.  There are only 1-3 WBCs in the urine. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:   The plan is to admit the patient 
to the Intensive Care Unit for further work-up and evaluation.  An 
LP will be done in the Emergency Department, and following the LP, 
the patient will be sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  The diagnostic impression in the Emergency 
Department is seizure and coma of undetermined etiology. 
DISPOSITION (including condition on discharge):  The patient will 
be admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit following her lumbar 
puncture.

The patient was seen on 07/03/2075 with Dr. Ellington.  The patient

was interviewed and examined by me.  Resident's note was reviewed

and confirmed.  Plan of care was discussed.  Please see

resident's note for details.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is a 74-year-old woman

with history of insulin-dependent diabetes and end-stage renal

disease who presented to Emergency Department after an episode of

confusion associated with a blood sugar in the field to 67 (per

EMS) and responsive to orange juice with normal mental status

upon arrival in the ED.  On further history, it seems that the

patient took her usual dose of insulin this morning and ate

breakfast but missed lunch and dinner because of a flood in the

basement that had preoccupied her.  She has had prior episodes of

hypoglycemia associated with skipping meals.  Otherwise, she has

been feeling well.  No recent change in medications.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, hypertension, asthma, CVA/TIA,

and end-stage renal disease (predialysis).

MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, diltiazem, Nephrocaps, methyldopa,

Flovent, and Pravachol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Awake, alert, sitting up in bed, and

eating supper.  No acute distress.  Temperature 97.2, pulse is

81, respirations 16, blood pressure 170/82, and pulse oximetry

100% on room air.  Cardiovascular exam:  Regular rate and rhythm.

 Lungs are clear.  Abdomen is soft and nontender.  Skin is warm

and well perfused.  Neurologic:  Alert and oriented x3 and

nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  EKG:  Without ischemia.  White count 9.4, blood

glucose 93, creatinine 8.5, sodium 140, and potassium 4.9.

CLINICAL IMPRESSION:  Hypoglycemia in setting of renal failure

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

PLAN:  To lower NPH dose from 30 to 25 units.  PCP, Dr. Mcgee

was e-mailed.  The patient will follow up with him on Monday.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:



76F ESRD presumed from Type 2 DM, now admitted for hypoglycemia.



1.  DM: Check HbA1c.  Endocrine to see, given recurrent hypoglycemia.  Nutrition to see.

2.  HD today, as per usual schedule.  Will check iron studies, PTH, 25OH Vit D, URR.

3.  Hyperkalemia: Recirculation studies with HD today.

4.  CAD risk: Check fasting lipids, start ECASA 81mg qd, wean diltiazem and methyldopa and increase lisinopril as tolerated by BP.  Would not start beta-blocker at present until hypoglycemic episodes resolved.

5.  INR: Aiming for INR 1.5-2 - adjust coumadin accordingly.

6.  PO4: Start Phoslo 667mg po tid with meals.

6.  Dispo: Needs social work, PT, OT to see, as does not appear to be safe at home.

PATIENT: Massey, Ramona
MRN: 44690336
Attending: Andersen
HPI: 


The patient is a 79yF with ESRD on HD. She is being dialyzed via a right brachiocephalic fistula that was created in Nov 2075. The patient is a very poor historian and the subsequent information has been collected from the medical record. While the fistula is beng used successfully for dialysis, it has undergone aneurysmal dilatation and the patient has also developed non-healing areas over the fistula at points of access. There is note made in the chart that the patient has had difficulty with recurrent outflow stenosis and for this she seems to have undergone angioplasty at Brooks Hospital (no record in LMR) recently. The patient does not have any complaints.

CC: 

question of unresponsive


HPI:80 yoF with ESRD on HD (T/R/Sa), severe dementia, and h/o falls, discharged 12 days ago from ZCC s/p fall and femur fracture. Patient was evauated by Ortho who wanted to pursue a trial of non-operative management with bracing

 as patient was a poor surgical candidate.  


The patient was seen one day PTA in the ED for hypotension at HD. Appearantly on the trasfer to BH the patient fainted in the ambulance. The patient denied all complaints and had a normal head CT and EKG and was discharged home.  


Patient was at YGH today and per nursing notes, the patient was not responsive verbally, wuith BP 136/58, BS 105, O2 100% on RA during this period.  However,  nursing reports some epidoses of apnea, clinically resolving after 15 minutes, during this episode, afterwhich the patient perked up on her own. Per LMR patient is only intermittenly verbal and severely demented at baseline.  Incontinent at baseline, no acute incontinence, no jerking or shaking.


Of note, patient is cared for by daughter and numerous ancillary serivces. The patient's family has refused SNF placement in the past. Patient makes only occasional urine at baseline.


Daughter reports patient has been eating fine at home, but is worried about these two episodes of ""unresponsiveness"". Patient is scheduled for fistulogram tomorrow and patient is supposed to be NPO after midnight for this procedure.


ED Course: Patient is being admitted for observation. Patient has baseline normal VS, follows commands, patient has not passed out or become apneic in ED. CT Head not repeated as done yesterday. ED physician states EKG shows no acute infarct.



ROS: Good appetite, no fevers, patient has been compliant with all medications per daughter. No coughs or colds, NO prlonged diarrhea.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ms. Greenwood comes in to urgent care clinic for
hives after taking Keflex.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  She is a 47-year-old woman with
chronic hydradenitis suppurativa since the age of 18 in her left
axilla and her groin.  She has been to the emergency room
multiple times for purulent drainage around her groin.  She has
been given multiple courses of antibiotics including Keflex and
dicloxacillin.  She is planning to have her disease surgically
managed in the next few months.  She most recently presented to
the emergency room on January 7, 2079 with swelling and drainage
of her hydradenitis in her groin.  She was given a prescription
of Keflex.  Shortly after taking the first tablet, she developed
itching in the hands, face, and legs and as well as hives.  She
denied any shortness of breath, difficulty breathing or loss of
consciousness.  She called the emergency room and was instructed
to stop taking Keflex as this was most likely an allergic
reaction.  So now, she is here for follow up from that.  She said
shortly after stopping antibiotic her symptoms of hives and
itchiness have improved very quickly.  She is still complaining
of purulent drainage around her groin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes.

MEDICATIONS:  Glucotrol, Percocet as needed for pain.

ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to erythromycin and now Keflex.  She
gets hives from both.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her left axilla looks dry.  Her bilateral
groins looks red, swollen tender with some serous as well as some
purulent drainage.  There is no fluctuance that I could feel.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Worsening of her hydradenitis.  Given the
recent allergy to Keflex, we will obviously need to take a
different antibiotic.  She has been on dicloxacillin in the past
with good result.  Despite the 15% cross allergy of dicloxacillin
compared to Keflex, I think dicloxacillin is a good choice for
now.  If this does not work, I think one should consider
clindamycin for treatment.  I will go ahead and give her 14 days
worth of dicloxacillin and I instructing her to notify M.D. if
she develops any allergic reaction to this medicine.  I also gave
her 60 tablets of Percocet as well as renewed her renewed her
prescription of Glucotrol XL 2.5 mg a day.  She should see her
PCP in two weeks.

 PICH CLINIC VISIT

PT: Nora Greenwood

Date of Visit: 3/24/80

Contact information: 715-007-3511

Id/cc: 48F with PMH of type II DM, hyperlipidemia, obesity, hidradenitis suppurativa, and new diagnosis of fibromyalgia presenting to PICH for follow-up visit re: 1) DM; 2) HTN; 3) hidradenitis suppurativa 4) fibromyalgia/joint pain.

HPI: Interval hx to be reviewed by each issue.  

1) DM: Most recent HgbA1c on 12/31/79: 7.1 (down from 8.2). Nora reports fasting BS in the 140-150 and pre-dinner BS ~low l00's, but does not always check her FS on a regular basis. Noticed that her FS were running much high (>200) when she was taking the elavil for her fibromyalgia. She stopped the elavil bc of these elevated FS. Continues to take Glucotrol XL 2.5mg qd. Denies any episodes of hypoglycemia, but aware of possible symptoms and knows to keep candy with her at all times. Saw nutrition on 6/5/79 and feels that her diet has improved since this session. Continues to be quite active, walking a lot at her job (RN) and at home. 

2) HTN: Continues to take lisinopril 20mg qd; BP slightly elevated at last visit at 144/68. Plan to repeat BP check today and if still elevated to increase lisinopril. Denies chest pain, SOB, DOE, LE edema, pnd, orthopnea, recent visual changes, palpitations, or headaches. Has been shoveling snow on a regular basis without sob or chest pain. 

3) hidradenitis suppurativa: Nora recently completed 14day course of levaquin for a flare of her hs. In past, treated with diclox and augmentin; however, nora felt that both became less effective with time. Also treated with Bactrim which was d/c'd 2/2 stomach upset. Feels that acute inflammation is better, but still with baseline, fairly severe inflammation, discharge, and pain. Had been seen by general surgery in the past who felt that she needed to be seen by plastics. Was scheduled to see plastics in consultation, but was told that she had to pay 200.00 for visit even though she was free care and could not afford this. Continues to use clindamycin topical gel. Denies fever, chills, night sweats, or n/v. 

4) FIBROMYALGIA/JOINT PAINS: Nora was recently seen in urgent care on 2/13/80 with c/o diffuse joint pains and myalgias x 2 weeks. Urgent care w/u included a negative ana, RF, and normal parvovirus IGM level, but IgG was 7.79% (normal less than 1.1). Seen by Dr. Marshall in Rheum who did not feel that she had a ""bona fide synovitis"" but considered ddx including fibromyalgia and inflammatory arthritis. Further work-up included a negative anti-ccp, normal EST, and a negative ASLO. He started her on elavil to improve her sleep, but nora stopped 2/2 elevated bs. Does feel that improved sleep significantly improves her symptoms.

A/P: 49F with type II DM, HTN, obesity, hidranitis suppurativa, panic attacks, and fibromyalgia; a/p to be discussed by specific issue. 1) DM: Most recent HgbA1c slightly above goal of <7 (7.4) and increased from prior HgbA1c 6.9. Suspect increased HgbA1c reflects recent cessation of metformin which Nora was not able to tolerate. Per her report, fasting AM FS appears most elevated, although random BG checked at last was 186. Asked Nora to keep a log of her FS, checking fasting, 2 hour post-prandials, and qhs FS on alternating days.

----2/81 urine microalb/crt: 62.8, above goal of <30 and likely due to persistently elevated BP. Adding additional blood pressure agent today (toprol XL) and will re-check malb/crt once BP under better control. 2/81 BUN/CRT: 15/0.7. 
----will perform DM foot exam at next visit. Nora denies any numbness or tingling of extremities at this time.

----11/80 (NON-FASTING): TCHOL: 189; HDL: 48, TRIG: 154, LDL: 110; on Simvastatin 80mg qhs. LDL slightly above DM goal of <100, but Nora has since attempted to increase exercise and eat low fat, low cholesterol diet. Rechecking lipid panel today. 
----OPTHO: will need to confirm appt at f/u visit 2) Hidranitis suppurativa: 
----will confirm referral to plastics and schedule if necessary
----prescribing course of cipro given e/o inflammation (less than previous flares) on exam today. 3) STD testing: Recent rpr, HIV, HBC, and HCV neg. Still not able to test for GC/Chlamydia, but no sx   s at this time to suggest infection. Will continue to offer, but again Nora declined given significant groin HS. 
----recommended HBV vaccination and gave Nora green slip4) Left Shoulder/Arm pain: Suspect multifactorial 2/2 possible rotator cuff injury, biceps tendonitis, and adhesive capsilitis. Offered steroid inject at last visit, but Nora declined and continues to decline. 
----will call about MRI results and consider treatment pnd results5) Pain control/Narcotics log: Given increased use of short-acting percocet, started long-acting MS contin 15mg BID and encouraged use of percocet for break-through pain. No trouble w constipation at this time, but warned Nora of increased risk given daily use of narcotics and encouraged hydration and increased fiber intake. Also reviewed Narcotic log contract and conditions. Nora is aware of conditions and rules as well as risks/benefits of chronic narcotic treatment. She agreed to drug testing today as well as all conditions described in contract.
----checking urine drug test today (Nora affirmed use of valium and percocet at 6:00am) 6) HTN: Still above goal of <130/80 and with e/o microablumin on 2/81 urine test on HCTZ 25mg qd and lisinopril 40mg qd. Will add toprol XL 25mg qd today. Discussed possible side-effects including fatigue, mood changes, etc. 
----scheduled f/u with NP in 10d to re-check BP and HR; consider increasing dose if still not at goal and HR tolerates. Will also assess for development of any SE at that visit. 
----TO DO: review sleep apnea ROS at next visit and will need to re-visit smoking cessation
7) Elevated AP: Suspect 2/2 fatty liver (elevated GGT confirming GI source and RUQ w e/o fatty liver) and asx at this time; continue RF modification (wt loss, strict lipid control). Will re-check in 6 mos (~7-8/81). Consider GI eval if significant elevation or symptoms.

Will continue to discuss and work to get treatment for her HS. Expressed my concern regarding continual deferral of mammogram and risk for cancer. Nora states that she understands risk but simply feels that it would be impossible given level of pain. I offered to give her pain medications but she still does not feel that she could undergo this test yet. Will continue to discuss with her.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Dietz is a 59-year-old woman who comes for follow up of diabetes and other medical problems.



PROBLEMS:

1.  Diabetes mellitus.  Last A1c six months ago was 6.6.  Last eye exam also was six months ago.

2.  Hypertension.  No chest pain, shortness of breath, or pedal edema.

3.  Hypercholesterolemia.  A fasting lipid analysis done five months ago showed total cholesterol of 158, triglycerides of 55, HDL of 52, and an LDL of 95.



MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily, calcium carbonate 600 mg b.i.d., Diovan 80 mg daily, Glucophage 850 mg b.i.d., lorazepam 1 mg q.i.d. p.r.n., Paxil 10 mg daily, and fluvastatin 20 mg daily, but she ran out some time ago.



REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  She has noted some pruritus between several toes on both feet. No significant weight change, febrile signs or symptoms, headache, blurred vision, tinnitus, chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, abdominal pain, nightsweats, diarrhea, dysuria, polyuria, skin rash, bruising, joint pain, or focal weakness.  





PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is in no acute distress.  Blood pressure 124/80, weight 154 pounds, and temperature 98.6.  Skin exam: Notable for slight erythema and breakdown between several toes on the right and left feet.  No scaling elsewhere.  Pedal pulses 1+ bilaterally.  Sensation is intact on plantar aspect of both feet.  Chest: Clear to percussion and auscultation.  Extremities: No edema.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

1.  Diabetes mellitus.  Good control.  Will recheck values today.

2.  Hypertension.  Good control.  Diovan renewed.

3.  Hypercholesterolemia.  I reviewed with the patient the need to take medication essentially for lifelong.  Better control of LDL than previous value also indicated.  I gave her a prescription for Crestor 10 mg p.o. daily.

4.  Tinea pedis.  I explained disorder to the patient and preventive care.  Also, gave prescription for clotrimazole cream.

5.  Adult health maintenance.  Mammogram requested.  Influenza vaccine given.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dizzy.

I confirm that I have seen and evaluated this patient, reviewed

the resident's documentation, and discussed the evaluation, plan

of care, and disposition with the patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old woman with a

history of diabetes and hypertension who for the last 24 hours

really has had trouble getting out of bed.  She started feeling

dizzy having difficulty with moving and fatigue, never really

felt like this before.  She does feel a little bit dizzy when she

stands up and went to North Iowa Oral Surgery Center where

they discovered her to be in heart block and sent her to us.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS.  Negative for fever, chills, chest pain,

shortness of breath, and abdominal pain.  She does admit to

several bug bites.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History of polyarteritis nodosa 30 years

ago.  She is non-insulin-dependent diabetes and hypertension.

MEDICINES, ALLERGIES, SOCIAL HISTORY, AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As per

the chart.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  An obese woman awake, alert, and oriented.

 She has a junctional rhythm in the 30s on the monitor with P

waves marching out as well but not in sequence with her QRS.  Her

blood pressure is 150 systolic.  She is awake and alert and her

oropharynx is normal.  Neck is supple.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac

exam is bradycardic without murmur, rub, or gallop.  Abdomen is

soft and nontender.  Extremities:  Without cyanosis, clubbing, or

edema.  She does have an area of erythema in her mid back,

nontender, no central clearing.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient has an EKG that shows

AV dissociation with relatively narrow complex junctional escape

rhythm.  Her chest x-ray is clean.  The rest of her lab exam is

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

by the EP Service and the plan is to take her to the Cath Lab for

a percutaneous transvenous pacer.

DIAGNOSIS:  AV dissociation.

EDOBS^14477347^BENNETT, NANCY^11/02/97^OAKLEY, ALBERT

This is a shared visit with resident, Dr. Cantrell.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is a 79-year-old

female with a past history of insulin-dependent diabetes,

bronchitis, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of

65%, COPD, and polyarteritis presenting here with some

generalized weakness since yesterday.  She has no focal deficits.

 She had no fall, no fevers, no chest pain, no shortness of

breath, no abdominal pain, no nausea, no vomiting, and no

diarrhea.  She is able to ambulate with a walker.  She denies

headache.  She was feeling well until yesterday.  She had no

recent medication changes.  She has chronic lower extremity

edema, left greater than right.  She has stable 2-pillow

orthopnea.  She is followed by Dr. Whitman of Cardiology.  She

takes Lasix 80 mg twice daily among other medications and the

status was stable.  She had a normal cardiac stress test

approximately 4 months ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She presents with a heart rate of 84,

respiratory rate of 16, blood pressure initially of 220/90,

systolic pressure decreased to 175 without treatment shortly

after arrival, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air with

temperature of 98.5.  She is awake and alert.  She is in no acute

distress.  She has moist mucous membranes.  Her neck is supple

with full range of motion.  She has mild left-sided facial droop,

which she states is old.  She has clear and equal breath sounds

bilaterally and no respiratory distress.  Heart is regular

without murmurs.  She has soft, nontender belly.  She has

asymmetric lower extremity edema with 2-3+ pitting edema to the

left and 1+ pitting edema to the right, which she states is

chronic and unchanged from baseline.  She has 5/5 strength

throughout.  She has no pronator drift.  She is able to ambulate

with a walker.

LABORATORY DATA:  Basic laboratory testing shows an unremarkable

CBC and Chem-7.  A set of cardiac marker shows a troponin of

0.06, which is decreased from her most recent baseline, which has

been elevated over the past several months.  Her BNP was 112. 

Her urinalysis was unremarkable.  Her EKG was a paced rhythm. 

Chest x-ray was unremarkable.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was discussed with Dr.

Whitman who recommended the patient be admitted to the

Observation Unit for another set of cardiac markers to ____

troponin as well as observation.  He will see the patient in the

morning.  If the patient's ____ set of cardiac markers are not

increasing and she feels well enough to go home, she will likely

be discharged after Dr. Whitman sees her and makes any

medication adjustments that are necessary.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Hypertension.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Generalized weakness.

DISPOSITION:  Observation Unit.

U/A neg.



DIAGNOSTIC TESTS / CARDIOLOGY DATA:

No acute ischemic changes, no signif change from previous.  Pos. PVC.  Pos. PVC and bigeminy on telemetry.



RADIOLOGY:

Lower extremity dopplers neg. for DVT.

Plain films of lower extremities neg. for gas or osteal elevation.





IMPRESSION: 50 yo man with chronic venous stasis and exacerbation of RLE skin breakdown, left shift in WBCs, and chest pain with dysrhythmia.



PLAN:

1.	Cellulitis:  Despite DM and venous stasis, lesion that the patient has is very superficial, and therefore need not be treated as a diabetic ulcer, requiring coverage for pseudomonas and anaerobes.  This is rather a simple cellulitis, and may be treated with Ancef.  Consult wound care nurse to recommend appropriate dressings and care of wound.  Consider c/s surgery for unaboots.  No debridement necessary.  Send blood cx - monitor for bloodstream seeding.  Consider MRI of LE to r/o osteomyelitis, however, doubt such a shallow ulceration could cause it.

2.	Chest pain with bigeminy and PVCs:  Rule out for MI by enzymes x3, as ?new dysrhythmia may signify ?myocardial irritation/damage.  Monitor EKG and telemetry.  If ruled out, consider inpt vs. outpt adenoside mibi.  Check lipid panel to further elucidate CAD risk, possibly start a statin.

3.	Deconditioning/SOB:  Consult PT/OT to assist with mobility and exercise tolerance.  

4.	Prophylaxis:  Fragmin.  Counsel re: weight loss.

Date of Admission: 8/09/2121
Attending: Thomas Wyatt
PCP: Ulisses Xuan (Santa Barbara General Hospital)
Source of History: Patient and medical record

CC/RFA: SOB, extremity edema, abdominal discomfort

HPI: This 53 yoM with a hx of morbid obesity, CHF, COPD, Diabetes and OSA reports a increase in his weight from 395 lb to 450 lb over the last 2-4 weeks. This occurred despite his efforts to lose weight and his active participation in a weight watchers weight reduction program. The weight gain was accompanied by abdominal distension and    bloating   , increased leg swelling and increasing SOB. He also reports severe DoE, with a maximal walking distance of 5-6 steps, as well as a deteriorating a scrotal edema with some dysuria, and rectal incontinence. Since the recent weight gain, he also developed an extensive itchy erythema in his groins.  He denies CP, diarrhea, HA, fever, chills, cough. His PCP prescribed metoclopramid and protonix for his abdominal complaints; however, the patient felt dizzy and dehydrated after taking these medications and decided to discontinue those. He also stopped taking his regular lasix medication about a week ago. Because of his increasing SOB, he called EMS, who found him cyanotic in his apartment with an Sa02 of 73% on RA. 

ED Course: On arrival in the ED, his VS were: T98, BP108/65, RR24, HR100, O2Sa 92% on 4L 02. He received one dose of lasix 80mg iv, urine output unrecorded. He was transferred to Internal Medicine for further management.

EKG: SR @90 BPM, low voltage, 1. degree heart block, right axis deviation

Radiology: 
CXR (portable): Low lung volumes.  Pulmonary vascular redistribution cannot be excluded on this semi upright film.
CXR (pa/lat): Mild pulmonary congestion with cardiomegaly. Small right pleural effusion. Stable elevated right hemidiaphragm.

Assessment and Plan:
53 yoM with hx of morbid obesity, CHF,  HTN, COPD, DM type 2, OSA, p/w increasing SOB and abdominal discomfort.
 
SOB: Most likely related to a combination of CHF flare (due to lasix discontinuation, BNP 1326) and COPD (PFT in 2120 indicated severe obstructive and restrictive deficit). CXR showing cardiomegaly and right-sided pleural effusion, consistent with CHF.  Started on oxygen, lasix, combivent nebs. Will reevaluate cardiac function with TTE. In the absence of CP, PE unlikely.  Cardiac enzymes negative. 
CHF: Currently treated with Verapamil for afterload reduction. Will consider to switch Verapamil to ACEI. Reinitiated Lasix. 
HTN: patient here normotensive. Currently taking verapamil, however, 1. degree heart block. Will consider switching to ACEI. 
OSA: Patient on home oxygen. Will suggest CPAP/BiPAP
Diabetes: Currently taking Glybyride, will obtain HBA1c here, keep on RISS while inpatient.
Abdominal discomfort/bloating: Most likely related to recent weight gain of 30 lbs, diabetic gastroparesis might also be contributing. Patient unable to tolerate metoclopramide. Discussed possibility of gastric bypass, patient rejects.
Rectal incontinence: Might be related to diabetic neuropathy. Patient also unable to perform anal hygiene because of obesity. 
Groin erythema: Suggestive of fungal infection. Will treat symptomatically with miconazole and obtain dermatology consult. 
RLE ulcer: Granulating leg ulcer, Will continue topical care.  
Prophylaxis: Fragmin SQ, Nexium
Code Status: Full

DOB:               3/22/68



Dear Dr. Joshua Morgan:



I am seeing this 55-year-old gentleman in the office today for evaluation of lymphedema and chronic venous stasis in both lower extremities.  The patient has had innumerable episodes of ulceration, which heal with TubiGrip and Profore dressings ultimately to break down again.  The patient has been discharged from the TNA and as I understand it the question is put to me today is whether the patient is a candidate for a Lymphapress.  The patient has had chronic bilateral lower extremity discoloration and swelling for over ten years.  He has never worn compression stockings.  He has had multiple episodes of recurrent ulcers.  To the best of his knowledge he has never had phlebitis but has had Unna boots in the past.  The patient denies any prolonged hospitalization, long bone fractures or prior history of DVT. 
There is no family history of varicose veins or DVT.  He has no personal history of cancer or trauma.  He has not been involved in any prolonged travel, does not take any hormone medication and is unemployed.  



The patient's past medical history is notable for coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, peripheral neuropathy, morbid obesity, hypertension and pulmonary hypertension. 



His current medications include lisinopril, verapamil, metformin, furosemide, aspirin, vitamin C, Spiriva and Advair.  



The patient denies any family history of cancer, thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia or bleeding.  



The patient was raised in Dothan and lives in Galion.  He does not work, denies alcohol abuse and quit tobacco eight years ago.



His review of systems is notable for right upper quadrant pain, dyspnea, glasses, diabetes and hyperlipidemia.



On physical exam he is a morbidly obese gentleman with intertriginous rashes question fungal origin in the axilla on the right.  He has distant breath sounds with fine expiratory wheezes.  He has some tenderness in the right upper quadrant to palpation.  He has a huge protuberant abdomen.  There is no tenderness in the right upper quadrant.  He has bounding carotid, brachial and radial pulses.  His femoral pulses are not palpable likely due to his body habitus.  On the left his dorsalis pedis is 1+ and on the right his posterior tibial was 2+.  He has huge legs with evidence of stasis dermatitis and lipodermatosclerosis, which is greater on the left than the right.  He has prominent varices on his right thigh near the takeoff of what appears to be an anterolateral accessory branch.  He has severe brawny induration, discoloration and superficial ulcers on the right with none on the left.  The patient seems somewhat reserved but is quite communicative when prompted.



The results of his noninvasive vascular lab studies showed bilateral greater saphenous vein reflux.  The reflux is confined to the first accessory saphenous vein in the right leg and the saphenopopliteal junction in the proximal thigh.  It should be noted that the reflux in the saphenopopliteal junction on the right is 0, in the anterolateral saphenous vein on the right it is 3 seconds and in the small saphenous vein on the right the reflux is 3 seconds.  In the deep femoral vein, common femoral and superficial femoral vein there is no reflux.  In contrast on the left there is reflux at the saphenopopliteal junction of a mere 3 seconds, in the proximal greater saphenous vein 3 seconds, midthigh 3 seconds and distal thigh 3 seconds.  In the popliteal vein there is no reflux and the small saphenous vein there is 3 seconds.  Due to the patient's size it was difficult to identify perforators.  



In summary, we have a morbidly obese gentleman with mild to moderate reflux on examination and severe stasis dermatitis and discoloration.  Thus there is a mismatch between the degree of physical findings and objective laboratory data.  I believe that this is the case primarily because the patient cannot lie flat and often sleeps with his legs in a dependent position.  Thus he has an ongoing stasis in his legs due to inactivity and dependency.  This in addition to his morbid obesity, that is a girth of 385 pounds that presses on his abdomen 24 hours a day, seven days a week and compresses the vena cava as well as the lymphatic drainage of his legs.  All of these factors taken into account contribute to his discoloration, ulceration and lower extremity swelling.



The solution to this problem is not an easy one.  With his obstructive sleep apnea and abdominal girth the chances of him objectively putting his legs up so they are higher than his belly or heart are nonexistent.  Certainly it is not unreasonable to use a Lymphapress machine to help remove some of the swelling and edema that this patient experiences in his legs, however a Lymphapress is not a maintenance device but is an interventional device.  If we do not have a plan as to what to put on his legs after the Lymphapress is removed in between treatments it will be of no long-term benefit.  I would recommend that he use a Lymphapress machine and intermittent wraps with 6 to 8 inch ACE wraps.  I would always make the tension in the ACE wraps at the level of the ankle and heel greater than the midcalf.  I have given him a prescription for a Lymphapress machine as well as ACE wraps and discussed the relevant components of his care, which are important.  I hope that these interventions will help him with his lower extremity edema and swelling.  It is unlikely that any intervention at the level of his veins will overcome the terrible hydrostatic pressure of his abdomen and total body girth.  If I can provide any additional information regarding Mr. Uribe, please let me know.



Sincerely,






Michael D. Roe, M.D.

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Shortness of breath



HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Uribe is a 56 yo man with a history of CHF (EF 61%), COPD, OSA, PulmHTN, HTN, DMII, chronic venous stasis, and morbid obesity presenting to the ED with shortness of breath.  
Patient has had 2 prior admission (2121, 2122) for CHF exacerbations, last admission requiring lasix 80 IV TID to diurese 1-3L/day.  Patient states his dry weight is ~380lbs.  He was recently in Amboy after surgery for nonhealing venous stasis ulcer and returned home in 9/24.  Upon returning home his weight was down to 342 lbs, however upon admission it is 409 lbs.  Patients reports the past 3 weeks he has felt abdominal bloating, increased LE edema and increase dyspnea on exertion.  At baseline he is able to ambulate short distances on his cane however now he is barely able to get up off the toilet. 
He also reports increased drainage from his RLE wound.  He reports medication compliance except for missing 2-3 times over the past several weeks.  He reports increased fluid intake including Progresso soup, ice water, diet coke and a &#8216;dash&#8217; of salt to his food.  At baseline he requires 2L O2 during the day and 4L at night.  His CPAP machine has been broken for the past week.  He typically sleeps on 3 pillows but has recently increased to 4.  He awakes from sleep often feeling short of breath and sits on the edge of his bed to catch his breath.  Today he saw his PCP at Saint Mary's Hospital Fallbright Center for the above complaints and was sent immediately to the urgent care clinic.  From there he was transferred to the HBH ED.



In the ambulance he received 40 mg IV lasix x 1 and had 1L of UOP.  In the ED, VS were HR 106, BP 110/80  RR 20  O2 sat 96% on 5L.  He received another 40mg IV of lasix and put out 800 cc.  Labs revealed a K of 3.1, Mg of 1.4, Hct of 35.4 and BNP of 1625.  K and Mg were repleted.  Diltiazem 30mg po x 1 was given for rapid afib.  CXR showed stable interstitial edema.  Patient was admitted to medicine for further work up.

EKG &#8211; Sinus rhythm with PACs, LAE, incomplete RBBB &#8211; unchanged from prior


                

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Mr. Uribe is a 56 yo man with a history of CHF (EF 61%), COPD, OSA, PulmHTN, HTN, DMII, chronic venous stasis, and morbid obesity presenting with shortness of breath likely secondary to CHF exacerbation from right sided failure.  Appears to have class IV disease with symptoms at rest.  BNP is elevated from baseline (584) at 1625 confirming acute exacerbation.  Exacerbation may be from increased Na intake, medicine non-compliance and increased po fluid intake, could also be from anemia.



##: CHF exacerbation &#8211; patient responded well to 40mg IV lasix with UOP of 1 L


Lasix 40mg IV BID titrate to TBB goal of at least -1 L (will likely require more as patient required 80 mg IV TID last admission for CHF)
 
Monitor strict I/O&#8217;s
 
Daily weight (dry weight)
 
Na restrict to 2gm, fluid restrict to 2L/day
 
Continue lisinopril and verapamil for rate control
 
O2 therapy, titrate as indicated
 
If fails to improve with aggressive diuresis, consider PE CT given history of immobility



##: Anemia &#8211; iron studies last done in 2116.


Check Fe, TIBC, ferritin, retic count



##: Diabetes


Hold metformin
 
AC and HS finger sticks
 
Regular insulin sliding scale



##: Venous stasis ulcer


Continue BID ace wraps with calcium algenate and ABDs per vascular surgery
 
Patient has appt Thursday. w/Dr. Roe &#8211; will notify of admission

RIVERS,KARSTEN   957-18-08-4                    VISIT DATE: 02/07/66

The patient was seen and examined by me.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 39-year-old man with a 

history of hypertension and diabetes, whose social history is 

unremarkable, who has a negative review of systems, and who has no 

history of any surgical procedures.  He presents with a burn on the 

right side of the neck.  He presents to the emergency department 

with a minor amount of redness on the right side of the neck and 

minor soft tissue swelling.  The trachea is midline.  The uvula is 

midline.  There is no airway compromise.  There are no airway 

complaints.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  No voice change.  The airway is patent and 

intact.  The lungs are clear, with no wheezes.  The examination 

shows a first-degree burn of the right side of the neck, with no 

blistering and no breakage of the skin.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient received a tetanus shot 

and was seen by the Burn Service.  He was dressed with Bacitracin 

and discharged home.  He was to follow up in 48 hours just for a 

recheck.  The Burn Service essentially signed off on him, with no 

need for follow-up, but given this was his neck and only 

first-degree, I asked him to return here for follow-up.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  First-degree burn of the right side of the neck.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  He is discharged 

with Bacitracin ointment and analgesics, and is to follow up in 48 

hours.  The patient's condition on discharge is stable.

RIVERS, KARSTEN
95718084
10/26/2073


To Whom It May Concern:

I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Karsten Rivers in the Cardiovascular Clinic at the Kimball County Manor for initial evaluation and management.  As you may know, he is a 47-year-old gentleman with a history of poorly controlled hypertension, poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, former tobacco use, morbid obesity, no family history of early coronary disease and no known coronary disease.  He was presented to the Cardiovascular Clinic today for preoperative evaluation prior to an orthopedic surgery scheduled for later on this week by Dr. Phillip Isaac Crosby, at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation Center.  This gentleman has a torn ligament in his right hip and is scheduled for laparoscopic repair at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation.  Mr. Rivers, as mentioned, denies any history of known coronary artery disease.  He has had a prior stress test greater than 15 years ago, but none recently.  He denies any recent catheterization or echocardiogram.  He works currently as a floor coverer in Shelton and has done so for 20 years.  He is able to ambulate approximately two flights of steps, but at the top of the steps develops slight dyspnea on exertion, unclear whether or not this is related to a cardiac etiology or secondary to his morbid obesity with his weight over 400 pounds.  He denies any heart failure symptoms, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema or nocturia though he has been maintained on Lasix diuresis in the past though none currently.  Additionally, he has poorly controlled diabetes for which he is being followed in the Diabetes Clinic here at the KCM as well as poorly controlled hypertension for which he is on multiple agents.  He denies any history of exertional chest discomfort and as mentioned, he is still quite active despite his BLANK as an Interior Designs floor coverer.

Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.

Past medical history is remarkable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity.

Medications include Toprol-XL 125 mg p.o. daily, aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily, Lipitor 20 mg p.o. daily, Neurontin 400 mg p.o. daily, insulin, Aldactone 25 mg p.o. daily, Avapro 300 mg p.o. daily and minoxidil 10 mg p.o. daily.

He is allergic to penicillin for which he develops a rash.

His social history is remarkable for former tobacco use for many years, though he quit more than three years ago.  He has no extensive alcohol or illicit drug use history.  He lives locally with his wife and five children and as mentioned is a floor coverer in ID working at Provo.  He is followed by Dr. Gilmore at the Helena Hospital for primary care.

On examination, he is afebrile, heart rate is 98 and regular, blood pressure 148/78 and respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute in no acute distress.  He is a well-appearing gentleman in stated age with morbid obesity.  His jugular venous pressure is difficult to estimate given his habitus.  He is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1, S2 and no murmur, rub or gallop.  His abdomen is obese, nontender with positive bowel sounds and no hepatomegalies appreciated.  His extremities are warm and well perfused with trace edema at the ankles.  He has good distal pulsations.  His carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruit.

Laboratory values are not available today.

ECG reveals normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 99.  He has left anterior fascicular hemiblock with normal R wave progression through his precordium.  No evidence for LVH or prior infarction.  He does have low voltage in his limb leads, consistent with his morbid obesity.

Impression:  Mr. Rivers is a very pleasant 47-year-old gentleman with multiple cardiac risk factors, notably insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus as well as poorly controlled hypertension with no known coronary artery disease now presenting for cardiovascular clearance prior to elective hip repair scheduled for three days from now.  This gentleman has no known coronary disease and has a reasonable exercise capacity, which I estimate to be 3 to 5 METS.  Most recently, given his hip and orthopedic issues, he has been unable to ambulate even to three METS.  However, prior to his orthopedic injury several months ago, he was able to ambulate up two flights of steps with only minimal dyspnea upon reaching the top step and without any exertional chest discomfort.  However, given his multiple risk factors, notably his poorly controlled diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension as well as former tobacco use, he certainly is at very high risk for obstructive coronary disease.  As such, I recommended we obtain a Persantine PET stress test for tomorrow morning.  If this test is normal without any high risk features or without any evidence for obstructive coronary disease, it would be reasonable for him to proceed with surgery later on this week.  This test will also suffice for his upcoming gastric laparoscopic bypass surgery, which is scheduled for 01/2074.  With regards to his medication, his blood pressure still is not at goal below 130.  As such, I have increased his Toprol-XL from 125 mg to 200 mg p.o. daily.  This medication should be continued through all surgery.  Additionally, if this is not sufficient in bringing his blood pressure down below 130, I would recommend the addition of a diuretic to his regimen either Lasix 20 mg p.o. daily or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. daily.  Additionally, it will be essential that his diabetes be taken better control of and he is now working closely with the diabetes center here at the KCM to do so.  His last A1c was approximately 13 and this is certainly way out of range for someone of his young age.  I am hopeful with continued medical therapy this gentleman can continue to improve his life and undergo orthopedic surgery as well as gastric bypass surgery with significant improvement to his quality of life and future cardiac risk.  With regards to his hypertension, he is on multiple agents including Toprol-XL, Aldactone, Avapro and minoxidil.  Given the multitude of agents, it would be reasonable to screen this gentleman for secondary causes of hypertension including hyperthyroidism as well as hyperaldosteronism, but notably he has currently started the Aldactone and this would be difficult to do while on the medication.  We could consider in the future, if his blood pressure is not well controlled either washing out the Aldactone and then followed by renin and aldosterone testing versus BLANK sampling in the future if deemed necessary.  Additionally, if he is found to have coronary artery disease, one other option despite his lack of claudication would be evaluation of renal artery stenosis.  As mentioned, I will obtain the stress imaging tomorrow morning and then we will be able to have a better assessment of whether or not it would be reasonable to proceed with surgery in the near future.  I will follow back with him in approximately several months' time for followup of his general cardiovascular care.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything I can do to contribute to his ongoing medical care in the interim.  He has been provided both my e-mail and pager number to contact me if there is anything I can do to assist in his care going forward.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

I have examined and treated the patient myself as well as reviewed 

and confirmed the resident's detailed documentation.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Briefly, this 68-year-old woman 

with a history of diabetes and a past history of ulcers on the 

right foot complains of increased pain on the right leg over the 

past three days.  It was worse yesterday.  It was slightly better 

today.  She has not really been able to get out of bed secondary to 

the pain, whereas she is usually very active.  She denies fever, 

chills, palpitations, and diarrhea.  She has not recently checked 

her blood sugar.

Dear Dr. Pagan:



Your patient Lauren Ferrara came into the office today for a follow-up visit.  As you know, she has a long and complex history of peripheral vascular disease with bilateral lower extremity bypass grafts.  Her left lower extremity bypass graft had occluded once previously, but was successfully restored by Dr. Tejeda.  In 02/61, we had detected a high-grade stenosis in the distal aspect of this graft by surveillance, and she underwent revision with a local patch angioplasty.  A subsequent ultrasound study done in 04/61 showed a widely patent graft and she has remained entirely asymptomatic.  She is not particularly active.  She denies any rest pain in the feet or significant claudication symptoms.  Recently, however, her husband had noticed some cyanosis of her left toes.  She remains on low dose aspirin in addition to Lipitor and her other medications.  She is a nonsmoker.



On examination today, she appeared well and in good spirits.  Blood pressure was measured at 130/60 in the right arm.  Lower extremity pulses are 2+ at the femoral level bilaterally.  On the right, there is a strong, easily appreciated pulse over her popliteal to dorsalis pedis bypass graft, and the foot is warm and well perfused.  On the left, I could not appreciate a pulse over her bypass graft incisions.  The left foot is slightly cooler than the right, and there are some mild cyanotic changes on the first toe in particular.  There are no frank or impending ulcerations or areas of irreversible ischemia.  There is a strong Doppler signal obtained over the posterior tibial artery at the ankle with an occlusion pressure of approximately 100 mmHg.  This yields an ankle index of nearly 0.7 and maybe falsely elevated.  A follow-up ultrasound study was performed in the vascular laboratory today.  The right lower extremity bypass remains widely patent.  As suspected, the left lower extremity bypass has now demonstrated to be occluded.



Ms. Ferrara left lower extremity bypass graft has occluded sometime during the last several months and her collateralization is clearly more marginal.  At the present time, she does not have any clear-cut symptoms of critical limb ischemia, though the slight discoloration of her toes is a clear sign.  The previous history of this graft including a prior thrombosis requiring thrombectomy and multiple revisions would not board well for any attempted thrombolysis or repeated rescue of this particular conduit.  Conversely, she has already had all of her lower extremity veins used for bypass operations and any redo bypass would be technically complicated.  I will need to review her previous angiograms from earlier this year to determine the status of her runoff and what the alternatives might be.  At the present time, however, she appears to have marginal, though reasonable collateralization and is essentially asymptomatic.  I think it would be reasonable to increase her antithrombotic therapy and I added a daily dose of Plavix to supplement a baby aspirin.  I spent sometime discussing the signs of worsening ischemia including more diffuse cyanotic skin changes of the toes, rest pain, or ulceration.  At a minimum, I will see her back in two months for reexamination, but I strongly encouraged the patient and her husband to contact us soon if there are any symptoms that suggest worsening of her circulation.  If her collateralization can remain stable, it certainly would be preferable to avoid having to consider a complex redo bypass with very limited remaining vein in this patient.



Thank you again for allowing us to participate in her care.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of further assistance.



Sincerely,

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Ferrara returns for followup visit.  She is now approximately one month out from a redo left popliteal to peroneal artery bypass graft using a basilic vein from right arm.  Postoperatively, she did well, although she was very sensitive to pain medication in the hospital and it was difficult to get her moving.  She complains of persistent weakness and numbness in her right hand and some pain shooting into her right forearm.  According to the patient, this was present early during her hospitalization, but because of other issues, it was not paid very much attention.  She denies any significant pain in the leg.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, she appears generally well.  The right arm harvest site is healed well and the upper arm is soft without any evidence of hematoma, whatsoever.  The hand is warm and well perfused with intact distal pulses; however, she clearly has weakness of flexion of the first and second digits and some weakness of opposition.  She appears to have intact ulnar and radial function.  The lower extremity incision has also healed well and there is a strong Doppler signal over the peroneal artery at the ankle.  The foot is warm and well perfused and the previous ischemic lesion on the big toe is healing.  She had a followup graft scan today, which revealed her bypass graft to be patent with no evidence of significant narrowing.  The ankle index was measured at 0.88 on the left and 0.64 on the right.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Ms. Ferrara lower extremity circulation is stable and her bypass graft is functioning nicely.  Unfortunately, she appears to have had some neuropathic complication in her right arm that may have been related to her vein harvest surgery.  The exam suggests some possible partial comprise of median nerve function.  In any case, she is able to function reasonably well and a course of occupational therapy may improve things.  There is no evidence of compression from hematoma and no evidence of infection.  We will continue to follow her closely with a return visit scheduled in six weeks and a course of therapy was prescribed.

MAJOR DIAGNOSIS:  Lung mass.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Lauren is a 75-year-old woman.  She has only a very remote history of smoking, smoking not at all after the age of 30.  In early March, she was undergoing a routine physical.  At that time, she reported she had some mild weight loss.  However, she had been trying to lose weight.  She had no respiratory symptoms of dyspnea or cough.  A chest x-ray was obtained, which revealed a 6 cm left lung mass.  The patient subsequently had a CT scan.  The CT scan revealed a 4 x 6 lung mass in the posterior subsegment of the right upper lobe.  There were some modestly enlarged hilar nodes, but all below 2 cm.  She has some tiny sub 5 mm nodules in both lungs.  The patient is referred by her primary care physician, Dr. Jordon for further evaluation.  The patient has no history of lung .  She has no history of asthma or allergies.  She has not had any history of TB or a positive PPD.  She may have had some mild asbestos exposure when she worked in a publishing company, which had asbestos containing pipes.  She has no history of malignancy.  She has no avocational exposures to dust or danders.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes:

1.  Mild vascular dementia.

2.  Hypertension.

3.  Hyperlipidemia.

4.  Diabetes.

5.  Hypothyroidism.

6.  Peripheral vascular disease.

7.  Anemia.

8.  Renal artery stenosis with mild renal failure.

9.  Carotid artery stenosis.



MEDICATIONS:  Levoxyl 88 mcg a day, Plavix 75 mg a day, Aricept 10 mg a day, furosemide 20 mg a day, nifedipine 90 mg a day, Crestor 20 mg a day, metoprolol 25 mg a day, calcium, Zetia 10 mg a day, vitamin D, Nephrocaps 1 mg a day, fish oil, aspirin 81 mg a day.



ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and estrogens and red dye #5.



SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her husband.  She does not drink.  She has a very remote smoking history in her teens and early 20s.



FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is in no distress.  Her O2 saturation is 95%.  Her blood pressure is 130/70, her pulse is 53.  Head and neck exam:  She is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Her nares are without discharge.  Oropharynx with dentures.  She has no erythema or exudate.  Neck is supple without adenopathy, thyromegaly, or bruits.  Her thorax is kyphotic.  She has normal fremitus and percussion.  Her lungs are clear.  Cardiac exam:  No JVD, S1, S2 without S3, S4, or murmurs.  Abdomen is soft.  Extremities have no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  She has residual of vascular surgery in her legs.  She has slightly diminished peripheral pulses.



LABORATORY DATA:  Spirometry is normal.



IMAGING STUDIES:  A chest CT is as noted.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  A 75-year-old with a large right lung mass.  This is likely to be malignant, although a nonmalignant process or inflammatory processes are remotely possible.  At this point, I am going to refer her for a PET CT scan.  Her small nodules in her lung fields bilaterally are all sub 5mm and may not be related to this malignancy.  She does have modestly enlarged hilar nodes.  I am going to refer her to Thoracic Surgery for consideration of a mediastinoscopy and potential resection.  She would likely require cardiac clearance before this would occur.  She can follow up with me after her surgery if this proves to be an inflammatory lung disorder.  Otherwise, she will follow up with Oncology.  If she was deemed not to be an appropriate surgical candidate, either because of metastatic disease or because of comorbidity, she could have this lesion biopsied via a transthoracic needle aspirate.

	CT otherwise negative.  No intracranial hemorrhage, mass, mass

	effect, or edema.  No gross evidence of acute infarction, although

	MRI with diffusion weighted imaging would be more sensitive.

	Intracranial arterial calcification.  Bilateral lens implants.

	

IMPRESSION:

	Essentially normal head CT.



EKG:	

NSR 90 BPM, nl intervals, nl axis, deepening of old TWI aVL, new TWI V1-V4, isolated q in III

___________________________________________



Impression: 75 yo F with HTN, DM2, RCC s/p right radical nephrectomy 2079 presents with hypertensive urgency.  Not taking all of prescribed meds.  Could have left sided renal artery stenosis exacerbating HTN in setting of unilateral kidney, K is elevated, although Cr normal on cozaar.  Needs tight BP control esp in setting of DM to prevent nephrosclerosis.





Plan: 

HTN - BP now better controlled, cont to cycle q1 hr for now.  Will repeat EKG, ROMI with serial cardiac enzymes.  ASA, monitor.  Cont cozaar 50 mg qd (may need to d/c or decrease dose if K remains elevated) and start lopressor 25 TID and titrate up as needed for BP control.  Will not attempt to lower BP beyond 150-160's for now to prevent drop in cerebral perfusion pressure.  Cont ativan 0.5-1 mg PO BID PRN.  Consider MRI/MRA to assess for RAS given such severe BP elevation.  Strict I/O's.

F/E/N - Kayexalate 30g x 1, recheck K in AM, consider lasix.

DM - Cont glyburide, check QID FS with insulin SS.  Diabetic diet

Proph - Nexium, SC heparin

71F w/ multiple medical problems, including dCHF, restrictive lung disease, severe polyarthritis returns to clinic doing significantly better for the most part.

Regarding her shortness of breath, she undewent a stress test which was completely wnl. She has also lost some weight (intentional) and states that, although she still gets short of breath with exertion, it is noticeably better.  She is being followed by the pulmonary department and is under consideration for a cardiopulmonary exercise test.

For her cough, the nexium has helped a lot and she likely has sig reflux despite the negative esophagram. The weight loss is probably helping with the gerd as well.

Regarding her arthritis, he L shoulder pain is much improved with PT.  Her biggest complaint at the moment, though, is her low back pain. She was seen in pain clinic for two injections. She states that the injections may have helped for 1-2 days but then the pain returned. She says this is her most limiting symptom. She is begging for narcotics.

Lastly, she has clear stress urinary incontinence, was cleared for a TOT sling but has now decided to push this procedure off until next spring.

Patient Name: FLAHERTY, XAVIER;  MRN: 1935081
Dictated on: 10/23/2120 by ROSITA KO, M.D. 

 
The patient is a 72-year-old male, paraplegic, referred for evaluation of recurrent bladder infections.  The patient has persistent presence of bacteria in his urine and there is a concern that he might have a persistent source of infection.  The patient denies fevers, chills, sweats, decrease in energy, loss of appetite, pain in the lower abdomen or penile discharge.  He reports there is some soreness around the meatus, which he attributes to self-catheterizing he is required to do 3 times a day.  He is well educated in terms of cleaning around the side and the appropriate way to do self-catheterization.   
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, hypertension, paraplegia secondary to unclear disk problems in 2107, right hip ulcer with trochanteric osteomyelitis in December 2118, treated with Unasyn x6 weeks and debridement and surgical flap, sacral decubiti in 2119 treated with Unasyn x6 weeks, local debridement healing by secondary intention.  No history of kidney stones.   
SOCIAL:  Ex-tobacco use 2-3 packs per day, quit 25 years. Alcohol prior heavy use, quit 25 years.  Lives alone.  Prior work included Heavy-Duty Equipment Mechanic, Ironworker, as well as Electric Appliance Servicer.  
 
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  
 
MEDICATIONS:  Blood pressure medication, name unknown. Metformin.  Note, patient had been on Bactrim prophylaxis over the spring.   
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 150/100, heart rate 100, temperature 97.9.  In general, vigorous, well-appearing man in wheelchair.  Awake and alert.  HEENT, sclerae anicteric.  Conjunctivae noninjected.  Neck supple.  No significant lymphadenopathy.  Chest, clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac, regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.  Abdomen benign.  Extremities, warm and well perfused.  No edema.  
 
IMPRESSION:  Presence of bacteria in static urine within the bladder is not necessarily diagnostic as infection given patient's lack of symptoms and likely reflects colonization.   
PLAN:  Would not treat patient with antibiotics unless he develops signs or symptoms of infection such as fevers, chills, sweats, elevated white blood cell count, pain in the suprapubic area or decreased energy.

-WILL CONSIDER increase the dosage



			

5.Recurent UTI 

-Will not give prophylaxis for recurrent UTI's. Also, will not treat patient unless he has systemic symptoms of fevers or there is a great increase in the amount of burning he has on urination 



			

6. Elevated PSA 

-urology felt that in light of stability of PSA and patient's desire not be biopsied that no intervention should occur at this time. 

-urology wants to see the patient annually. Spoke with the patient again about this today. He doesnt want to see urology again and doesnt want a rectal exam.



			

7. Anxiety 

-well controlled, will continue the Zanax 



			

8. Health Maintenance 

-patient has received pneumovac 

-last colonoscopy was on 12/18 

-gave the patient a flu vaccine (9/22) (Lot BDIKB454QH and expiration 7/3/23)

RE:  Xavier Olive

Dear Michael,

Mr. Xavier Olive presents for evaluation, thanks for your
referral.  As you recall he is a 71-year-old gentleman who is
status post angioplasty on the left for high-grade stenotic
lesions of the distal superficial femoral artery and the
popliteal artery on the left.  The patient presents now for
further evaluation of his ""claudication symptoms"".

The patient states he has bilateral lower extremity symptoms,
there are about equivalent in nature.  He has very minimal low
back pain.  He states it seems to be getting worse and seems to
be associated with some abnormal gait.  He states on a bad day
its about a 9/10 and even on a good day sometimes it can be as
high as 8-9/10.  The episodes are almost daily and are brought on
by things like walking.  He can walk less than one block at which
point he has lateral calf burning and at times notes some slow
shuffling and occasionally falling.  When he is having severe
symptoms he notes his legs to be weak.  He denies any bowel or
bladder abnormalities of late, but has a historic of a chronic
UTI secondary to his benign prostatic hypertrophy.  He has very
little back pain associated with his symptomatology.  He has had
no physical therapy to date and no spinal injections.  He
describes his general health as poor, but when specially asked he
states it is because he his 71 and has a history of hypertension.
 Years ago he stated he was in excellent health.  His weight is
steady at 200 with no significant weight gain or loss.  He
doesn't smoke and drinks socially.  Quit smoking 33 years ago. 
He does not think he will ever be pain free.

Review of Systems:  Reveals that he is a diet controlled diabetic
and he has been for the past couple of years.  He has difficulty
with sleep.  He has a balance problem and also has benign
prostatic hypertrophy leading to chronic urinary tract infection,
for this he takes Cardura.  He has a history of high blood
pressure.  Denies any other cardiovascular abnormality.  No
respiratory malfunction.  He has had surgery for something ""in
his colon"" he has also had a bypass surgery.  He is on Plavix and
aspirin.

Physical Examination:  Shows that he is solid built, healthy
appearing male.  He is able to toe and heel walk but on the left
side his T band seems to be slightly weak.  Single toe raises
show that the right leg is stronger than the left leg.  He has no
tenderness to his PSIS and he has no Waddell signs.  He has
negative Trendelenburg bilaterally.  Forward flexion allows him
to get to the patella.  Extension is pain free and passive
hyperextension does not reproduce the symptoms.

Motor testing is normal in his lower extremities.  Sensory is
symmetric.  He has negative straight leg raises.  He has no
palpable pulses.  He is hairless in his lower extremities.  He
had no clonus or Babinski and a negative Hoffman's suggesting
that he is not myelopathic despite his ""balance abnormality"".

He is on multiple meds for his hypertension, for his diabetes,
and for his gastroesophageal reflux.

Personal review of his plain films and a CAT scan indicating
with, show decent residual lumbar lordosis with a stent noted in
his iliac artery on the right.  CT scan shows lumbosacral facet
hypertrophy.

At this point, impression is of spinal stenosis and degenerative
disk disease.  I have asked him to obtain an MRI and return to
see me after that.

Thanks for the referral.

Mr. Olive was seen with Dr. Innis in general neurology clinic on 07/11/55.   Dr. Innis was present for or performed all salient aspects of the history and physical exam and together we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan. 



Return visit.

Mr. Olive is a 71y old RHM, with Idiopathic Parkinson's disease. He was started on Sinemet 25/100mg tid with significant improvement in his balance & gait & rest tremor. However there were still periods of shuffling & stumbling especially going down slope. He also complained of persistant fatigue in his legs. We started him on Amantadine 100mg tid during his last visit. He did not tolerate it well & complained of dizziness especially when he goes out, even with reduced dose of 100mg bid. He has discontinued it since then.

He is tolerating Sinemet well, no hallucinations, on-off phenomenon. He does not notice any wearing off of the effect prior to next dose. No dyskinesias.

No new Neurological symptoms. He still has poor balance but his posture is much improved.

			CARDIOLOGY

			

			TRUMBULL MEMORIAL HOSPITAL

			



			Reason for visit:

   Second opinion regarding painful legs with walking at less than 50 yards and also balance disorder.



			Interval History:

   Mr.  Xavier Olive is a 73-year-old gentleman who comes into Trumbull Memorial Vascular Center for a second opinion regarding his lower extremity discomfort and also his progressive difficulty walking and maintaining balance.  His referring physician is Dr.  Ximena Keane, practicing out of Alexandria Clinic.  Mr.  Olive also heard about the TMH VC through TV advertisements.  



He is 73 years old, has history of diabetes starting in 2135, known history of peripheral artery disease with claudication and calf discomfort, for which he has previously seen Dr.  Cain at Alexandria Clinic, and also has been evaluated and treated at the Corcoran District Hospital.  Specifically, he describes having been evaluated by Dr.  Cain and others some three or four years ago, and undergoing at least two procedures, all related to his legs cramping up.  He received prior stenting to his right common iliac artery and his left superficial femoral artery, so far as I can tell.  The stents were placed at Pomeroy Care Center (Big Rapids, AC) and also he had evaluation at the Corcoran District Hospital, and may have had a stenting procedure or revascularization procedure there.  The patient and his wife are somewhat unclear about the dates and locations and times, but he does state that the treatments apparently did not help him at all.  Currently, he has discomfort in both calves when he walks too far or too fast, and this stops him at about 50 yards.  



The issue was complicated by the fact that he has had progressive parkinsonian-type symptoms, walking in a shuffle, tipping forward, and occasionally even falling forward and losing his balance completely.  His legs are rubbery, and he does even realize that he is falling forward when it happens.  It is worse when he is carrying things that weigh anything.  At the same time, his calves do cramp up in a typical fashion consistent with claudication, and he has known peripheral artery disease.  Also feels though his hips sometimes are cramping up.  The patient feels quite disabled by his symptoms, especially as a gentleman who was active and never had physical problems of this nature.  Again, there is some degree of blurring between the parkinsonian symptoms and his claudication, as to which is truly causing his disability.



			Past medical history:

   Diabetes, onset in 2135.  

Parkinsonian-type movement disorder, followed by Dr.  Jeffers and Innis, and for which he was placed on Sinemet, presuming it was due to Parkinson's.  The patient has not improved despite trying the medications.  MRI at AC starting in 2153 has shown apparent central and peripheral atrophy, unchanged.  

Status post vertebrobasilar TIA by report.  

Neuropathy, documented by EMG in 2151 with no spinal stenosis by MRI.  

Cervical spondylosis.  

Tracheal tumor resection in 2128 performed via a suprasternal incision.  

Hypertension.  

Mild renal artery stenosis documented by arteriography in 2153 during one of his peripheral angiograms.



Current Medications:

  lisinopril 2.5 mg QD

 glyburide 2.5 mg QD

 cilostazol 100 mg BID

 terazosin 4 mg QD

 Sinemet 25/100 mg 2 tabs TID

 aspirin 325 mg QD

 pyridoxine 50 mg QD

 atenolol 25 mg QD

 folic acid 1 mg QD

 gabapentin 100 mg BID

 metformin hydrochloride 850 mg TID

 ranitidine HCl 150 mg QHS

 Zocor 10 mg QHS

 Plavix; Dir: Stopped because of ecchymosis and epistaxis -stop



Allergies:

			

No known allergies   



			Family history:

   Noncontributory.  No coronary artery disease or MI.



			Social history:

   He is retried Motor Vehicle Body Repairer.  He used to work at GM.  He lives with his wife, who comes in today with him.  He has three children.  Nondrinker.  He smoked until 30 years ago.



			Review of systems:

   Detailed review of systems was carried out.  It was also reviewed on the patient questionnaire sheet that the patient brought with him.  He does claim to have some dyspnea with exertion as well as intermittent indigestion consistent with GERD.  He has nocturia.  He wears dentures.  No significant weight loss or anorexia.  No visual changes or other neurologic symptoms other than the gait disturbance and neuropathy.  He denies chest discomfort or anything to suggest cardiac ischemia.  Otherwise, review of systems is negative in detail.



Physical examination:

			

-Pulse:   68 and regular.  Afebrile

-BP: 105/55    , obtained by myself.  Equal bilaterally

-General:   Well-developed male in no distress, appears his stated age.  Slightly stooped over, and has a parkinsonian-type affect and appearance

-Skin:   Without rashes

-Heent:   Normal facies, or slightly masked, with normal extraocular motions and reactive pupils

-Neck:   Carotid upstrokes are normal, no bruits.  No JVD

-Chest:   Clear

-Cardiac:   Discloses normal S1 and S2, no S3 or S4, and no murmurs

-Abdomen:   Moderately obese, protuberant, soft, and nontender.  Good bowel sounds, no organomegaly, no enlargement of the aorta.  May be a soft bruit in the midline to deep auscultation

-Extremities:   Femoral pulses are 2+ bilaterally, with soft bruits on both sides.  Below this, no cyanosis or edema (perhaps trace to 1+ edema), and posterior tibial pulses are 1 to 2+.  Dorsalis pedis pulses are not easily palpable.  Good capillary refill

-Neuro:   Gait is disturbed, with slight shuffling and slightly stooped.  His strength is normal, and sensory findings are slightly abnormal with diminished sensation in a stocking-glove distribution.  He does not have any cogwheeling to my examination.  Otherwise, no focal deficits



Procedures:

			

Free text procedures  Exercise ABIs-resting ABI is normal on the right and left at 0.  92 and 1.03, respectively.  The toe brachial index drops to 0.29 on the right side and 0.91 at 1 minute after exercise.  I am not sure what to make of these ABIs since it appears that the actual ankle-brachial indices were not measured following exercise.



			EKG:

    demonstrates normal sinus rhythm or sinus bradycardia at heart rate of 55.  There is normal axis and intervals, with no evidence of prior infraction, and perhaps a slight right ventricular conduction delay.



			Other Data:

   DOB: 11/25/2083.



			Assessment and plan:

   Lower extremity arterial disease (PAD)-the patient clearly has history of PAD with prior interventions on both sides.  Currently, complains of symptoms that sound like claudication, predominantly involving the calves on both sides, right slightly ahead of the left, and I would not be surprised if he has significant focal obstructive disease along the length of his iliac of SFA.  Since his ABIs are well preserved at rest, I suspect he does not have pre-occlusion of the SFA, for example.  On the other hand, he does have diabetes and his ABIs may be falsely elevated.  



His major limitation is due to a combination of the claudication that occurs less than 50 yards and stops him at that point, and the gait disturbance that he has related to his movement disorder, possible Parkinson's disease.  I am not sure that this latter entity has been well enough defined, and I would suggest that we have him see a neurologist here to better ascertain the nature of that disease, and as to whether there is anything better available in the way of treatment.  



1.  As far his peripheral artery disease, it would be extremely helpful to obtain films from AC and/or the CDH, to better define what procedures were actually performed and where stents were placed.  Given that it has been a year or more since his last intervention, it is likely he will need another angiographic study (or MRA/CTA) in order to ascertain the nature of his disease.  



2.  Neurologic disorder-we will refer to a neurologist.  



PLAN: 

1.  Formal exercise ABIs.  

2.  Obtain angiographic studies from AC.  

3.  Followup visit in one month.  

4.  Appointment with Dr.  Ruiz.

General Examination
-------------------------------

6/08/2158 1:31 pm:  In his right arm,  his blood pressure was 100/42 and  his
pulse was 60 per minute  when lying; his blood pressure was 80/40 and  his
pulse was 64 rrr per minute  when sitting.  The orthostatic change was
symptomatic.  He appeared well-nourished and well-groomed.
6/08/2158 1:36 pm:  In his right arm,  his blood pressure was 90/40 when
sitting.

Rating Scales:
UPDRS Subscale III (Motor Examination):  Subscale total score was 22 out of
108.  This subscale was completed while the patient was ON.

Tremor at rest was rated on a 0 to 4 scale (with 0 being absent): 0 in the
face, 0 in the right upper extremity, 0 in the left upper extremity, 0 in the
right lower extremity, 0 in the left lower extremity,.

Action or postural tremor of the hands was rated on a 0 to 4 scale (with 0
being absent): 0 in the right upper extremity, 0 in the left upper extremity,.

Rigidity was rated on a 0 to 4 scale (with 0 being absent): 1 in the right
upper extremity, 1 in the left upper extremity, 1 in the right lower extremity,
1 in the left lower extremity,.

The following movements were rated on a 0 to 4 scale (with 0 being normal): 
    Finger Taps: 1 in the right upper extremity, 1 in the left upper extremity;
    Hand movements: 1 in the right upper extremity, 1 in the left upper
extremity;
    Rapid alternating hand movements: 1 in the right upper extremity, 1 in the
left upper extremity;
    Leg agility: 1 in the right lower extremity, 2 in the left lower extremity.

Each of the following was rated on a 0-4 scale (with 0 being normal):
    Speech:  1 (slight loss of expression, diction and/or volume);
    Facial expression:  1 (minimal hypomimia; could be normal 'pokerface');
    Arising from a chair:  1 (slow or may need more than one attempt);
    Posture:  1 (not quite erect, slightly stooped posture; could be normal for
older person);
    Gait:  2 (walks with difficulty but requires little or no assistance; may
have some festination, short steps, or propulsion);
    Postural stability:  1 (retropulsion, but recovers unaided);
    Body bradykinesia and hypokinesia:  2 (mild degree of slowness & poverty of
movement that is definitely abnormal; alternatively, some reduced amplitude).

Assessment:  
  1.  Parkinson's Disease:  Parkinson with decline in strength and endurance.
It is possible that the added  Sinemet is causing a decrease in his blood
pressure. I made a referral to Mary Darnell PT here at TMH. In addition Dr
Edward Nguyen felt a slight reduction of the Sinemet to 1.5 tab QID may help his
blood pressure with out changing his motor ability. RTC 1 month Dr Edward Nguyen
and 2 months Genevieve Noland, NP


Recommendations:

Medication given:
  Sinemet 25/100: 2 tab po qid.


Medication changes included:
   Stopped:
  pyridoxine 50 mg: 1 tab po qd;

  Sinemet 25/100: 1.5 tab po qid.

   Started:
  6/08/2158 Sinemet 25/100: 1.5 tab po qid.

Reason for Visit	

Mr. Whitehead is here for follow-up of multiple issues.



Problems	  

LOW BACK PAIN	      

he had prolonged discogenic back pain in 1/2070 and could not get appt with NAMG orthopedic/back surgeon and went to Montreal Medical Center.  He underwent L4/5 lamenictomy in 2/2070.  He has persistent right-lower back pain and has seen Dr. Conley.  A myleogram done on 8/5/71 showed degenerative disc disease with moderate spinal stenosis at L4/5.  He will be seeing Dr. Sheehan.  Mr. Whitehead is contemplating surgery as he cannot walk without pain.

Elevated blood sugar	      

BS was 191 in 11/1/69 and was in similar range during his hospitalization in Montreal Medical.  He has been on meds for NIDDM.  He could not tolerate high dose of glucophage and is now seeing endocrine.  His HBA1c was 7.5 in 6/71 on glyburide 5 mg bid and glucophage 500 mg qd.  He has regular optho exam and is on zestoretic.  Little rationale to check for microalbuminuria as he is already on ace-inh.  His lipids are controlled with diet and lipitor.

To see endocrine in 9/71.



hyperlipidemia	      

now on lipitor 40 mg qhs.  He has NIDDM and HTN.  His lipid profile from 4/71 showed a LDL of 103.  LFT were normal.  COntinue med.

HYPERTENSION	      

Now on zestoretic 20/25 qd + atenolol 50 mg qd.  He has significant white coat component.  It is again high at 170/80 in left arm.  His BP reading in hospital for myelogram this week was 130/80.  No change.



h/o PROSTATITIS	      

had recurring prostatitis sx's and saw Dr. Dotson.  Cystoscopy in 1/2070 was normal.  He is on flomax 0.4 mg qd and doing better.  His PSA was 2.9 in 8/69 and 3.2 in 8/70.  To see Dr. Dotson soon.



Neurological symptoms	      

he reports having intolerance to bright lights, tingling in his mid anterior abdomen and chest as well as numbness in his left middle three digits with some neck discomfort.  His MRI of his LS spine done at Montreal Medical in early 2070 evidently showed (by his report) no cord abnormalities.  His sx's sound like left-sided cervical radiculopathy but his visual and abdominal sx's makes me concerned about  systemic demyelinating conditions.  Will check TSH, B12 and have him see Dr. Conley. [08/28/70]



TSH and B12 levels were normal.  His sx's in his eyes and abdomen have essentially resolved.  He still has some cervical radiculopathy syptoms.  He will see Dr. Conley (yet to do so). [01/21/71]



still did not see Dr. Conley.  He now has right neck pain.  His left sided numbness has resolved.  Again referred him to Dr. Conley.  He likely has cervical radiculopathy. [04/09/71]



c-spine MRI ordered by Dr. Conley showed mutliple levels of spondylothis.

Problems	  

benign prostatic hypertrophy	      

PSA was 2.9 in 8/69 and 3.2 in 8/70 and 3.0 in 2/72.   He has done well on flomax and now sees Dr. Pena.



hyperlipidemia	      

now on lipitor 40 mg qhs.  He has NIDDM and HTN.  His lipid profile from 4/71 showed a LDL of 103.  LFT were normal.  Will check lab  work and continue med.  

Elevated blood sugar	      

BS was 191 in 11/1/69 and was in similar range during his hospitalization in Montreal Medical.  He has been on meds for NIDDM.  He could not tolerate high dose of glucophage and has seen Dr. Lozano in diabetic unit.  His HBA1c was 7.5 in 6/71 and 7.6 in 9/71 on glyburide 5 mg bid and glucophage XR 500 mg qd.   He is on zestoretic.  Little rationale to check for microalbuminuria as he is already on ace-inh.  His lipids are controlled with diet and lipitor.  He has no neuropathic sx's and sees ophtho regularly.  

HYPERTENSION	      

Now on zestoretic 20/25 bid + atenolol 50 mg qd.  He has significant white coat component.  BP is again 145/80 and is lower at home.  Pulse is 70 but it again sped up when he was being examined.



LOW BACK PAIN	      

he had prolonged discogenic back pain in 1/2070 and could not get appt with NAMG orthopedic/back surgeon and went to Montreal Medical Center.  He underwent L4/5 lamenictomy in 2/2070.  He has persistent right-lower back pain and has seen Drs. Conley and Sheehan.  A myleogram done on 8/5/71 showed degenerative disc disease with moderate spinal stenosis at L4/5.  He continues to have chronic low back pain in the right hip and right anterior thigh.  He exercises regularly and has not benefitted from prior epidural injection.  Dr. Sheehan felt that pain may be from some instability vs scar tissue from prior surgery.  Fusion surgery was discussed but Mr. Whitehead is not too keen on it. [12/25/71]



still has back pain but not ready for fusion surgery yet.

Elevated blood sugar	      

BS was 191 in 11/1/69 and was in similar range during his hospitalization in Montreal Medical.  He has been on meds for NIDDM.  His glucophage was stopped as his cr was in the 1.5-1.7 range.   He is now on glyburide 10 mg bid and his sugars are still high with fasting levels in the 180-250 range.  



His HBA1c was 7 in 11/73.  Will transition him to insuline with 25 units NPH sc qhs and he will monitor sugars bid and report back to me.



FU in one month to recheck HBA1c. 

benign prostatic hypertrophy	      

PSA was 2.9 in 8/69 and 3.2 in 8/70 and 3.0 in 2/72.   PSA was checked while in hospital by resident in 3/74 and it was 12.9.



Discussed ramification of this test.  Will favor rechecking his PSA in one month.  Due to recent DVT and his being on coumadin, he would not be amenable to undergo prostate biopsy in the next few weeks.  If PSA remains high, will have him see urology.

MRN:  9855218
ADMIT DATE:  3/17/78
ATTENDING:  Bell, Charley
Source: Patient and chart


CC:  Diarrhea
HPI: 1M with DM, HTN, HL, and Parkinson's disease.  In 7/77, he had been treated at NAMG for a left lower lobe PNA with levofloxacin, and developed diarrhea while in the hospital.  After discharge, he continued to have profuse diarrhea, and was treated with IV hydration and metronidazole C. diff infection, first found to be positive on 7/31/77.  Since then he has had multiple episodes of recurrent C. diff.   Most recently, he was admitted to NAMG for treatment of recurrent C. diff in 1/77, with improvement after receiving inpatient vancomycin and flagyl, and discharged to NAMG, where he was for 3 weeks.  He received 21 days of flagyl.  After about two weeks, he noticed a gradual increase in his stool frequency.  Three weeks prior to admission, he began taking 500 mg PO Flagyl q8h, which he had at home.  He felt that his symptoms were improved somewhat on the flagyl.  One week ago, he saw his PCP, where a C. diff stool toxin was negative.   At that point, he stopped the PO flagyl, and shortly afterward his diarrhea again progressively worsened.  Currently he is having 10 BM per day, and he states that they are similar to odor, color, and frequency to his prior C. diff episodes.  He has also had a few days of lower abdominal pain, 2-3/10, with no clear pattern, and noticed a few flecks of blood in his stool 2 days ago on one occasion.   He denies other symptoms including fever/chills, n/v, cp, sob, and dizziness. He reports that when he had taken PO vancomycin in the past, it cost $40 per tablet.


ED:  Afebrile, HR 70s.  Hypertensive to 189/82. He was given 1000 cc NS, 5 mg PO amlodipine, 20 mg PO lisinopril, 500 mg IV flagyl.

RE:  		Isabelle Y. Quick

ATCH: 		655-75-45



Dear Harry and Yair:



My thanks for your kind referral of the above noted patient with respect to her disabling claudication and of course she is not in a very happy circumstance.  As you know, she is just 52 years of age.  Her cardiovascular risk factors include type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and Glyburide, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and she is a former cigarette smoker but she has not smoked in a year.  She spends a lot of time caring for her partially disabled husband.  She has known and impressive history of peripheral vascular disease.  She has undergone bilateral leg revascularizations.  On the left side initially an iliac stent was tried but in January of 2063 she had a left iliofemoral endarterectomy with angioplasty and in situ above knee left fem-pop bypass graft.  This reconstruction is functioning well, as evidenced by pulse examination and she certainly does not have any major symptoms in the left side.  In April of 2063 she had a right common femoral and external iliac endarterectomy with a right fem-pop bypass graft to the above-knee popliteal artery using transposed greater saphenous veins.  There had previously been a right iliac PTA and stent.  She states that the procedure in the right leg was only transiently of benefit.  By last spring, i.e. a year ago she again had rather limiting claudication.  She says this is now worse over the past several months and she quantifies this as severe calf pain after just a couple of blocks.  Importantly she does not have ischemic rest pain and she has never had tissue loss.  Recently resting ABIs were recorded at 0.46 on the right and 0.8 on the left.  Her continued complaints led to a repeat arteriogram last October documenting a superficial femoral artery occlusion (??? length thereof - she did not bring the films themselves) and a patent albeit small reconstituted above-knee popliteal artery with decent runoff.  Understandably Dr. Adcock was reluctant about recommending further revascularizations.  She has sought an opinion here in this regard.  She has no known coronary artery disease and her general system review is notable for a prior hospitalization in 2061 for severe pancreatitis requiring laparotomy.  On physical examination blood pressure was 140/80.  Pulse was 70 and regular.  Carotid upstroke was normal and there were no major carotid bruits.  She has femoral pulses on both sides and the left fem-pop bypass graft in situ is palpable, as is the left popliteal pulse.  There is no right popliteal nor right foot pulse.  She does have dependent rubor on that right side although there is no tissue breakdown.



This is of course a very unhappy situation.  Further attempts at surgical revascularization in the setting of having both greater saphenous veins harvested and so forth is really not justified for claudication alone since the result can be anticipated to be not very good.  However I am not absolutely ruling this out.  I would suggest the following.  Her risk factor control is decent and she should certainly stay on the Lipitor, aspirin and Plavix.  Since her problem is claudication I would like Yair to institute Pletal at full dosages and give this at least a couple of months before we can say that she has had an adequate trial with question benefit.  She will get the actual arteriogram from the October study to me.  If it seems reasonable and the right superficial femoral artery block is not too long an attempt at percutaneous recanalization could be considered.  I will get back to you after review of the films themselves.  My thanks once again.  With every best wish.



Sincerely,





Daniel W. Iniguez, M.D.

Vascular Surgery Admission Note



Patient Name:  Quick, Isabelle

MRN:  6557545

Date and Time: 8/02/65 2:40PM

Attending: Dr. Iyer

Fellow: Dr. Wade

Junior Resident: Dr. Joyce



cc: thrombosed R fem-pop BPG; increasing rest pain in R leg



HPI:  The patient is a 53 year old woman with a past medical history of diabetes, HTN, and PVD s/p L fem-pop BPG with in-situ vein 2063, R fem to AK pop BPG with GSV 2063, R fem-BK pop BPG with propatent graft 9/17/64, and multiple attempts at angiographic intervention who presents with worsening rest pain in the R leg X 1 month.  



Immediately following her 2nd R fem-pop BPG in 9/2064, she felt well and without significant LE pain.  Over the past month, however, the patient reports that she has had progressive pain in her R foot and leg, which wakes her up from sleep almost every night.  She can walk less than one block without disabling claudication which improves with rest.  She also has noticed discoloration of her R foot, along with numbness and paresthesias, which have been progressive over the same time period.  



She denies all symptoms other than RLE pain and claudication as described.  Specifically, she denies chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, headache, and fevers/chills.  She reports that her left leg is occasionally painful, although it has been tolerable in comparison to her R leg.  She has been taking aspirin and plavix regularly, but has not taken coumadin for 2 days (last dose 7/31/65).  



She last underwent arterial LENIs on 7/17/65, which demonstrated critical ischemia in her R leg and a thrombosed R fem-pop BPG (see below for official report).  She is admitted for elective revascularization of her R leg.

(1)	Diabetes mellitus: Went on cruise.  Ate frequently but watched portions.  Apparently patient checks blood sugars between 3:00 and 3:00 and when she has shakiness.  She was under the impression that after lunch she had to fast for three hours prior to checking sugar, at which point notes low blood sugars in the 50's to 70's with shakiness, for which she takes a handful of raisins.  Generally eats breakfast at 8:30, lunch 12:00 or 12:30, supper at 5:30.  Snacks in the evening, always apple and yogurt.  Most recently, additionally popcorn and saltine crackers, occasional pretzels.  After takes raisins, shakiness of hypoglycemic symptoms resolve.  While on cruise, patient found that she could actually walk more than she thought she could.  Since she has been home, has not been walking routinely.

(2)	HTN: No chest pain, shortness of breath or palpitations.  

(3)	Back pain/lower extremity pain.  States taking glucosamine chondroitin.  Over the last two or three months, feels that it is helping with decreased pain.  Also has been seen at physical therapy again.  Feels that this is helping.



PE:	Weight down 2 pounds!.  Blood pressure, right arm: 126/68.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac: Regular rhythm at 66, no murmur or gallop.  



A/P:	(1)	Diabetes mellitus: Somewhat better control with mildly elevated morning sugars.  Have asked patient to decrease popcorn and/or crackers at h.s.  Have advised patient to take small handful of raisins prior to onset of hypoglycemic symptoms advised around 2:00 to 2:30 p.m.  Have encouraged patient to continue to walk daily.  Continue current treatment.

(2)	Back pain/lower extremity pain: Some improvement with PT and increased med.  Continue for now.

(3)	HTN: At goal.  Return to clinic at the beginning of November to Dr. Ullom to resume care.

NAME:     Umphrey, Tammy 
MRN:       0942207

The patient is here as a walk-in.  Her spouse is present.

Patient says she is status post a fall this past Monday at home.  Says that she seems
to have lost her balance while opening a door at home.  Denies prodromal
symptoms including shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations.  There was no
loss of consciousness.  Patient was seen in the emergency room that day for trauma
to the head.  Had a negative CT of her head and had an x-ray of her pelvis, as she
complained of some hip pain.  Both studies were negative.  Patient was then sent
home with Roxicet.  Patient was seen in the walk-in clinic at CPI yesterday, after
noticing a swollen tongue and some difficulty swallowing.  Patient was immediately
told to stop both her Roxicet and Monopril and was treated for angioedema with
Zantac and Claritin.  Today patient has no further throat tightness or tongue
swelling.  She is, however, uncomfortable continuing the Effexor for unclear
reasons and wants to stop it.

Patient is also complaining of severe low back pain, which she says has persisted
since her fall on Monday.  Did not have an x-ray of the area.  Says it is very painful
to sit.  Roxicet was not helping.  She is off her Ultram as well.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  WD/overweight female in NAD.  Vital signs as per LMR,
WNL.  Weight 213 pounds. 

Lungs - clear bilateral breath sounds.  Cor - RRR, S1, S2, without murmur or S3
noted.  Back - slightly bent gait.  Tenderness over lower sacrum.  No asymmetry or
obvious deformity.  

X-ray of sacrum 12/13/63 - could not see fracture as per my reading.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  

(1)  Angioedema.  Agree that most likely culprits are Roxicet since it was started
     only two days ago, and ACE inhibitors which have been associated with
     angioedema.  Currently on Lopressor and Dyazide, patient's blood pressure
     is WNL.  So will follow for now.

(2)  Low back pain.  Reviewed the possibility of a coccygeal fracture for which
     treatment would not be any different than pain management and a donut
     pillow.  Patient was given a prescription for the pillow.  She was told to look
     out for signs of nerve compression and to go to the ER if she experienced
     any perianal numbness or incontinence.  Will notify patient by phone if x-ray
     shows a fracture. 

(3)  Depression.  Did not feel I was able to speak freely in front of the patient's
     spouse.  Had been put on the Effexor by Dr. Zeman.  Advised patient to let
     her psychiatrist know that we are tapering her off of the Effexor.  Will take
     25 mg q.o.d. for the next week.  

(4)  Pain control.  Will switch from Vicodin to Vicodin ES 1 q. 6 as needed. 
     Knows to go to ER if experiences any symptoms consistent with angioedema.

Return to clinic in approximately one month.

Patient Name: UMPHREY, FRANKIE;  MRN: 0942207
Dictated on: 08/28/2064 by WHITNEY EASTERLING, M.D. 

 
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Falling and low back pain.  
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66 year old, right-handed female whose past medical history is significant for status post laminectomy at L3 to L5 in January of 2061.  The patient was in her usual state of health with some residual weakness from the stenosis and occasional buckling of her knees without loss of consciousness until 12/01 when she fell backwards.  There was no obvious leg buckling.  She said she just came off balance without loss of consciousness or dizziness or preceding lightheadedness.  Since then she has had several falls always when she is moving.   
MEDICATIONS:  Her medications have included in the past Motrin 800 t.i.d. without significant effect on her low back pain.  Ultram q.i.d. was beneficial.  Neurontin 300 q.i.d. which was also beneficial without side effect and chondroitin sulfate which she feels has been very helpful without side effect.   
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She has bilateral dysesthesias, left sciatica to her ankle.  She has had weight loss without fevers, chills or night sweat.  She has had no retinopathy and she has a history of reflux and otherwise her cardiovascular, pulmonary, GI/GU and musculoskeletal review of systems are unremarkable.   
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Spinal stenosis with a laminectomy at L3, 4 and 5 in January of 2061.  She has had left knee arthroscopy.  She had mild spinal stenosis at T12 to L1, severe at L3/4 and 4/5 with bilateral foraminal disease.  She has had a ten year history of diabetes.  She has hypertension and hypothyroidism.   
MEDICATIONS:  Synthroid, Premarin, glynase, glucophage, metoprolol and Effexor.  
 
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is married.  No history of tobacco or alcohol.  
 
FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for coronary artery disease, breast cancer and diabetes.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is a well-appearing, well-nourished, 66 year old female.  Her mental state examination is normal.  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  Motor strength is significant for full strength in the upper extremities as well as the lower extremities.  Sensation is intact to all modalities with bilateral lower extremity dysesthesia reported subjectively.  DTR's are symmetric with downgoing toes bilaterally.  Coordination is intact with no axial or appendicular ataxia.   
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 66 year old right-handed female with history of spinal stenosis status post decompression who has a history of falls.  We will obtain an MRI of her lumbosacral to evaluate that area for any recurrent pathology or new changes.  For her radicular pain will increase her Neurontin 400 q.i.d.  We would like to obtain EMG with nerve conduction studies of the lower extremities to evaluate possible need for reoperation.  The patient will return to clinic after these studies.  The patient was seen and evaluated and management was discussed with the attending.

      Team A Intern Admit Note

Patient Name: Tammy Umphrey

MR#  0942207

Date of Admission:  8/26/66

Attending: Yoel Pollard

PCP:  Susan Ullom



CC/ID:  70 yo woman with significant disability following cerebral aneurysm rupture 1/ 66, admitted with likely UTI and question of altered mental status



HPI:  (As summarized from ED admit note and computer notes, pt is not able to give history and family is not present.)  Ms. Umphrey is somewhat cognitively and expressively impaired following rupture of a cerebral aneurysm 1/ 66; she was required sub-occipital craniotomy, clot evacuation, and placement for a VP shunt.  She was transferred to Kingsley County Clinic 2/66, and was d/c'd 5/31/66. Discharge summary indicates that her baseline at that time included being able to follow 1 step commands part of the time and some attempts at communication.  She gets nutrition and medication through a G-tube at this point, and has had an indwelling foley catheter.

	Computer notes suggest that prior to August 5, the indwelling foley catheter had been removed. However, the patient's constant incontinence and difficulty keeping a decubitus ulcer dry, the notes suggest that the foley was replaced 8/5/66.  8/09/66 Ms. Umphrey was taken to the emergency room; the symptoms she was having at that time are not clear. U/A was suggestive of a UTI, and she was treated with a 3-day course of levofloxacin. There is no record of her foley catheter being changed at that time, and urine cultures were not sent.  Telephone notes from 8/23 suggest that Ms. Umphrey had yeast infection and foley blockage;  8/25 the VNA checked a U/A at home; results were consistent with a UTI.  Her husband reports that she has also been more somnolent and    less herself    over the last few days. She was sent to the PDI ED for further evaluation.

	In the ED, repeat U/A was consistent with UTI; urine culture grew abundant staph aureus. She was given a dose of levofloxacin 500mg and transferred to the floor.

Microbiology:





CXR:	The findings are consistent with pulmonary venous hypertension with possible early interstitial edema.



Head CT:  1. No significant change compared to prior CT Brain-04/18/2066.

	No change in ventricle size.   No acute infarct; although, this is

	better assessed with MR with diffusion.

	2.  Patchy low attenuation areas in the centrum semiovale

	bilaterally which are more prominent now and most likely are due

	to chronic microangiopathic changes in this agroup.



EKG:	Normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals. Flattened T-waves, but not changed from prior exam. No evidence of acute ischemia.



Impression:  70 yo woman with compromised baseline neurologic function, admitted with complicated UTI and possible change in mental status.



Mental status changes: given likely undertreated UTI 8/09/66, pt likely has recurrent complicated UTI and may have some mental status alterations from this source. Important to rule out VP-shunt complication as cause of mental status chage, but CT appears unchanged from 4/66. Hyponatremia may also be contributing somewhat  to mental status changes.

-will treat UTI and pursue possibility of urosepsis with blood cultures

-will check TSH and am cortisol which could also contribute to mental status changes, particularly given pts history of hypothyroidism

UTI

-likely UTI- tx

-will send blood cultures to assess for sepsis from urinary source

-unclear if staph aureus is true urinary pathogen, but will treat with vancomycin until sensitivities come back, then treat with appropriate antibiotic

-treat with levoquin for complicated UTI while awaiting final microbiology data

-change foley now

-resend u/a and culture after 1-2 days of antibiotics

Hyponatremia- may be contributing to any change in mental status

-volume status very difficult to assess- if hypovolemic, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia. If euvolemic, likely SIADH, which could be caused by neurologic process, pain, or infection

-given difficulty assessing volume status, will send urine for sodium and osm. If low sodium high osm, likely hypovolemic. If higher sodium, more likely SIADH.

DM

-will switch patient to ISS for now to assess in-hospital insulin requirements

Hypothyroidism- continue levothyroxine at home dose, checking TSH

GI/FEN- ranitidine BID, glucerna tube feeds per KCC discharge summary

HTN-continue home medications

wound care consult requested for report of decubitus ulcer

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Stroke.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old right-handed
woman with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and
hypercholesterolemia who was admitted to the Neurology Service on
06/18/2067 with right-arm weakness and difficulty speaking.  She
presented to the Emergency Room 5.5 hours after last seeming
normal.  Her initial NI stroke scale was 11.  She was admitted to
the Neurology Service for a stroke workup.  Her imaging studies
showed a left MCA infarct involving the left corona radiata, head
of the caudate basal ganglia, and an MI cutoff on the CTA and MRA
in addition to a left ICA occlusion.  She was taken to angiogram
for interventional neuroradiology.  She had an angiogram. 
Radiology felt they were unable to access the
cause and no intervention was attempted and the patient was
admitted to the Neuro ICU for blood pressure monitoring and
hypertensive therapy.  She remained stable anti-coagulated on
heparin.  During the hospital stay, she spontaneously converted
to rapid ventricular rate atrial fibrillation, which was felt to
be the likely source of her stroke and as such was planned to
remain anti-coagulated.  She was discharged to rehab and
subsequently went home from rehab on 08/04/2067.  At home, she
had been noted to have elevations in blood pressure but has been
feeling O.K.  VNA sees her once a week.  At rehab, for unclear
reasons, her warfarin was discontinued and in speaking to the
discharging physician from the Tracy Medical Clinic, this was
done for a question of vaginal bleeding although the patient is
unaware of any such problems.  She continues to get PT and
occupational therapy twice per week and complains that her memory
remains poor.  According to the family member and her daughter
who are here interpreting for her at Clinic today, she continues
to have right-sided weakness, although significantly improved and
decreased verbal output although her daughter seemed to be able
to communicate well with her.  Since her discharge, she has not
had any new episodes of numbness, weakness, headaches, or visual
changes.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies any fevers, chills, weight loss,
chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, leg cramps,
claudication, dyspnea on exertion, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis,
heartburn, abdominal pain, hematemesis, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, melena, dysuria, changes in bowel or bladder habits,
rashes, arthralgias, myalgias, polyuria, polydypsia, breathing,
or bleeding problems.  Review of neurological systems as above.  

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, diabetes, and elevated
cholesterol.

MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, Zoloft, Zocor, and Captopril.

ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in Castle Rock with her son. 
No history of tobacco or alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  A sister had a stroke.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure was 150/80, her heart
rate was 70, respiratory rate of 12.  General:  Pleasant woman in
no acute distress.  HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic, sclera
anicteric, and oropharynx is clear.  There is no thyromegaly. 
Neck:  Supple, no bruits, with 2+ carotids.  Heart:  Regular rate
and rhythm.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  Abdomen:  Has good
bowel sounds, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly. 
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Skin:  No rashes
or ulcers.  Neurological exam (conducted via her daughter and the
interpreter):  She is alert and oriented.  She is attentive.  She
is non-fluent with really minimal verbal output.  She has
decreased naming and decreased comprehension.  She does not have
any neglect or apraxia.  Registration is 3/4.  Short-term memory
is 0/4 in 5 minutes.  Pupils are 3 and reactive to 2 millimeters.
 Fundi are normal.  Extraocular movements are intact with
nystagmus.  Visual fields are full to confrontation.  She has a
right facial droop.  Facial sensation is intact.  Hearing is
normal.  Motor exam:  There is increased muscle tone on the right
arm and leg.  She has strength on the left is normal.  On the
right, her strength is at least 4/5 in all muscle groups on the
left on the neck, except for about 3/5 in the distal arm.  She
reports decreased pinprick and temperature on the right arm. 
There is no ataxia on the left.  Gait is slow, walks with a cane,
and so conducts the right leg.  Her reflexes are brisker on the
right at about 3 and she has a right plantar extensor response.  

IMAGING DATA:  Initial head CT on 06/18/2067 did not show any
acute stroke or hemorrhage.  On the CT, there was a question of a
left MI cutoff.  CT angiogram also showed a distal left ICA
stenosis with minimal distal interflow.  MRI of the brain showed
a left MCA infarction involving the left corona radiata, head of
the caudate basal ganglia.  She has had mild to moderate chronic
small vessel ischemic changes on her MRI.  Echo showed a normal
EF of 55% without any clot, no PFO.  

IMPRESSION:  This is a 73-year-old woman with significant
vascular risk factors, including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
with a left ICA MCA clot resulting in a left MCA territory
infarct.  On exam, she has residual aphasia involving both
comprehension and fluency; and a moderate right hemiparesis.  It
is unclear to me why the warfarin was discontinued but given her
stroke and the documentation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
during her hospital stay, I think that she would benefit from
anti-coagulation therapy.  I have asked her to get a follow up
PCP evaluation at the OCH to determine if indeed there are
any contraindications to anti-coagulation.  If there are no such
contraindications, she should restart on warfarin.  In addition,
her blood pressure is still not well controlled and I would ask
her to increase her Captopril to 12.5 mg t.i.d. and to maintain a
blood pressure diary.  

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Continue anti-hypertensive and increase Captopril to 12.5 mg
t.i.d.
2.  Blood pressure diary for next clinic appointment.
3.  Continue risk factor modification with the management of
blood pressure, diabetes, and hypercholesterol as she is doing.
4.  PCP evaluation for question of bleeding problem during rehab
stay and resumption of warfarin if there are no contraindications
per the PCP.
5.  Continue physical therapy and occupation therapy for gait
training and language rehab.
6.  Return to clinic in 6 months or sooner if there are any new
problems.

More than 50% of this clinic visit was spent on patient education
and counseling.

Re: Hannah Heath

OCH #: 91156456





Dear Dr. Norwood,

 

I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Hannah Heath, for consultation in the Vascular dept at the OCH.  As you know she is a 72 year-old woman with prior stroke. I will review his medical history for our records.



HPI: This is a 72-year-old right-handed woman with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia and PAF with a prior stroke (2067) who subsequently was admitted to the OCH again for SDH with supratherapeutic INR in 2068. She has a prolonged hospital course as well as rehab stay and now returns having made significant recovery.  She is here with her family who is translating.  She ambulates with walker, but does well over short distances without it.  She communicates well with eth family and is able to feed and dress herself.  She has an aid for bathing three ties per week. She has not needed the PEG tube in the past 6 months and is eager to have it removed. She has not had any new episodes of weakness, numbness, visual or language changes.



ROS: 

Denies fevers, chills, chest pain, SOB, palpitations, leg cramps, claudication, DOE, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis, heartburn, abdominal pain, hematemesis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena, dysuria, changes in bowl or bladder habits, rashes, arthralgia or myalgias, polyuria, polydipsia, bruising or bleeding problems.  Review of neurological system as above.

PHYSICAL EXAM:

BP: 120/60 		HR:70		RR: 14

GEN: Pleasant woman in NAD.

HEENT. AT/NC.  Sclera anicteric.  OP is clear.  There is no thyromegaly. 

NECK: Supple. No LAD.  Carotids are 2+ without bruits. 

HEART: RRR, no m/r/g

LUNGS: CTA

ABD: +BS. Soft.  PEG site inspected.  Slightly red margin. No significant drainage at this time. No odor.

EXT: No c/c/e

SKIN: No rashes or ulcers. 

NEURO: Cognitive testing limited secondary to language barrier. Alert and oriented.  Interacting well in Spanish with  her family members. No neglect or apraxias. Pupils  3->2mm.  Fundi are normal. EOMI without nystagmus. Right field cut.  Right facial. Tongue and palate are midline. Facial sensation is intact. Hearing is normal.  On motor exam there is normal muscle bulk, but increased tone right more than left. She has a mild right HP. There is a RPD. On sensory exam, pp/temp/vib are symmetric.  There is distal gradient loss of sensation.  There is no loss of cortical sensation.  There is mild ataxia with FNF and HTS and RAM on the right. Gait is normal based and uses a walker. Reflexes are symmetric. Plantar responses are extensor.



DATA:

MRI 2068: old right MCA stroke

CT 2068: SDH



ASSESSMENT/ RECOMMENDATIONS:

72 year-old woman with vascular risk factors including atrial fibrillation and prior stroke  with a subsequent SDH with super elevated INR who now returns for follow-up.  She has had a significant recovery. Our goal should now be secondary stroke prevention and risk factor modification.  Given that her bleed was a SDH and in the setting of elevated INR, it is worth considering restarting warfarin,  until then, she should at least be on ASA and I have communicated this with them. She should continue with her BP and cholesterol treatment as well. She is eager to remove the PEG and I will refer her to Dr Queen for this. RTC as needed. Call with questions.







More than 50% of this visit was spent on patient education and counseling.

EDVISIT^91156456^HEATH, HANNAH^03/01/72^YEAGER, CHRISTOPHER

I saw this patient with Dr. Rosalia West.  I confirm that I have

interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's

documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the

evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient. 

Please see the resident's note for further details.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Altered mental status.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old female

with history of prior strokes, hypertension, diabetes, and

paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, who presents with altered mental

status.  As per report, the patient has not been acting like

herself and not communicating or speaking like herself.  The

patient was in her usual state of health until a few days ago

where she started to develop a cough as well as some chills.  The

patient's family members state that the patient has not been out

of bed and has been unwilling to eat.  The patient's family

members state that the patient is not acting like her usual self.

 The patient's family members deny noting the patient complaining

of any nausea, vomiting, chest pain or shortness of breath.  The

patient was actually taken to clinic yesterday because the

patient was starting to speak less.  The patient was seen clinic

and was thought to be depressed.  The patient has a known history

of a facial droop.  The patient was incontinent of urine today.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's vital signs reveal the

following:  Temperature was 102.8, heart rate 110-160 beats per

minute, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure is 144/110, and

oxygen saturation was 95% on room air.  The patient's oxygen

saturation was interpreted as borderline low.  General:  No acute

distress, multiple family members at bedside.  HEENT:  The

patient's head was normocephalic and atraumatic, no scalp

hematomas.  Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. 

Mucous membranes were somewhat dry, right facial droop noted, no

drooling.  Neck:  Supple, no JVD, no carotid bruits appreciated. 

There was no meningismus.  Respiratory:  Poor cooperation with

exam.  Fair aeration, no focal rhonchi, rales, or wheezes, no

increased work of breathing or use of accessory muscles was

noted.  Cardiovascular:  Irregularly irregular, tachycardic,

unable to appreciate any gross murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  GI: 

Abdomen:  Soft, no rebound or guarding, prior well-healed prior

G-tube scar noted.  Rectal exam deferred.  GU exam:  The patient

was incontinent of urine.  Skin:  Warm and dry.  No rash or

lesions were noted.  Back:  The patient did not have any

costovertebral angle tenderness.  There is no midline thoracic,

lumbar, or sacral spine tenderness to palpation.  Extremities: 

Warm and well perfused, no clubbing, cyanosis or asymmetrical

lower extremity edema was noted.  There were no palpable cords. 

Neuro:  The patient was alert, the patient was a verbal.  The

patient grossly moved all 4 extremities with fair strength.  The

patient responded to touch appropriately.  The patient was unable

to cooperate with cranial nerve examination.

INITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  The patient is a 76-year-old female

with history of prior stroke, hypertension, diabetes, and

paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, who presents with altered mental

status and urinary incontinence.  Differential diagnosis at this

time includes infectious versus a metabolic abnormality.  The

patient has no new deficits on neuro exam as per the family and

as per review of prior notes.  Repeat stroke is certainly on the

differential, however, I have a lower suspicion then for a

metabolic or infectious etiology.  The patient will need to have

a large workup including laboratory studies, urine studies, Foley

catheter, portable chest x-ray, and repeat noncontrast head CT

scan.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Upon arrival to the Emergency

Department, the patient had history and physical exam performed. 

The patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid

ventricular response.  The patient's 12-lead EKG revealed a rate

of 166 beats per minute, atrial fibrillation with rapid

ventricular response, stable T-wave inversions noted over the

lateral leads as well as over the precordial leads.  No definite

ST segment abnormalities were noted.  The patient then had a

portable chest x-ray and as per report, the patient's portable

chest x-ray did not reveal any acute cardiopulmonary process or

findings.  The patient did have a noncontrast head CT scan and

the patient's noncontrast head CT scan was notable for some

right-sided edema.  The patient will have this followed up with

an MRI of the brain.  The patient's laboratory studies were

notable for sodium of 131 and potassium of 5.2.  The patient's

lactic acid was 1.7.  The patient's white blood cell count was

not elevated.  The patient was not anemic.  The patient's

urinalysis was consistent with infection.  The patient's first

set of cardiac markers were negative.  The patient's coagulation

studies were normal.  The patient was treated with ceftriaxone

for her urinary tract infection.  The patient could possibly have

urosepsis given her fever and tachycardia.  Urine sepsis is my

leading diagnosis at this time.  The patient's right-sided edema

is certainly concerning, however, I do not feel that the patient

will need to be admitted to Neurology at this time.  The patient

will be admitted to medicine for presumed urosepsis.  The patient

will need to be admitted to a monitor bed.  The patient's blood

pressure is normal, and as such, I do not feel that the patient

needs an intensive care unit bed.  In terms the patient's atrial

fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, the patient was

given metoprolol IV.  The patient was not given any oral

medications secondary to her possible stroke.  The patient was

given rectal Tylenol as well as rectal Kayexalate for her

elevated potassium at 5.2.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSES:

1.  Urosepsis.

2.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

3.  Hyponatremia.

4.  Hyperkalemia.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was admitted to the Medicine and to a

monitor bed.

CONDITION AT THE TIME OF DISPOSITION:  Stable, but guarded.

EDVISIT^06129040^MACK, ROSE^08/16/92^GRAHAM, ANGELA

This patient's visit was shared with PA, Quiring.  I also

personally interviewed and examined this patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 50-year-old female with

past medical history of type 1 diabetes, peripheral vascular

disease, and hypothyroidism who presents for evaluation of an

infected left heel ulcer.  The patient is status post bypass

grafting in her lower extremities and skin grafting of a

nonhealing ulcer on her right heel.  Since that time, she has

developed a chronic nonhealing ulcer on the left heel, which has

been followed closely by VNA.  Today, she was seen by her VNA who

was very concerned about redness and swelling of her left foot

with redness that extended underneath the plantar surface of the

foot and over the dorsal surface and concern for infection of

this ulcer.  The patient has minimal sensation in the left foot. 

She states sometimes she can feel a pressure sensation.  She does

have some pain when she tries to weightbear, has not noted any

fevers, has noted some chills and states that her fingerstick

earlier today was elevated.  She denies any abdominal pain,

nausea, or vomiting.  She does note that her foot does appear to

be somewhat slightly more swollen but has not noticed redness up

until today.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive for hypothyroidism, type 1

diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease with a nonhealing

diabetic foot ulcers.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She is status post femoral bypass

grafting, thyroidectomy, skin grafting for nonhealing wounds, and

right foot debridement in the past.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She smoked in the past, does not drink.  She

lives with family, is followed by a VNA, and is not working.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and is also positive for diabetes.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  All other systems reviewed and otherwise

negative except per the HPI.

MEDICATIONS:  Insulin.

ALLERGIES:  She has an allergy to codeine, aspirin, erythromycin,

oxycodone, and sulfa.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature is 98.6, her pulse 105,

respirations 16, blood pressure 117/70, and O2 saturations are

100% on room air.  The patient is awake, alert, frail, and thin

female.  She is in no respiratory distress.  Her head examination

is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Her conjunctivae are slightly

pale.  She has moist mucous membranes.  The airway is patent. 

Her neck is supple with full range of motion without any pain. 

The trachea is midline.  Her lungs are clear to auscultation

bilaterally with equal breath sounds.  No respiratory distress,

no accessory muscle use, and no chest wall tenderness.  Her

cardiac examination is tachycardic and regular at about 100 with

a 3/6 systolic murmur.  Her abdomen is nondistended, soft, and

nontender.  No guarding and no peritoneal signs.  Her skin is

remarkable for healing superficial ulcers on the right heel.  On

the left heel, she has a superficial ulcer with a dark eschar,

which is approximately 4 x 4 cm in diameter.  There is no

purulent discharge around the area; however, the skin of the left

foot is fairly violaceous and warm on the plantar surface of the

foot surrounding the ulcer extending up the lateral aspect of the

foot to the anterior aspect of the left ankle was demarcated in

the Emergency Department.  There is no other break in the skin

visualized.  Her back is nontender with full range of motion. 

Extremities are remarkable for lower extremity atrophy.  She does

have 1+ edema of both feet.  She has minimal sensation on

palpation of her feet with no obvious tenderness on palpation

over her left foot.  Her pulses are trace.  She is alert and

oriented x3, has a depressed affect.  See the PA note for

remainder of the details of the physical examination.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient had IV access

initiated.  Laboratory studies were sent including blood

cultures.  She was started on IV antibiotics, vancomycin, and

gentamicin and was consulted to Vascular Surgery.  Her feet

remained elevated.  She had a plain x-ray performed of her foot,

which showed no obvious evidence of osteomyelitis and no

subcutaneous gas.  Her laboratory studies are remarkable for

hyperglycemia and she was started on IV fluids.

DISPOSITION:  She is admitted to Surgery.

DIAGNOSIS:  Left foot, nonhealing ulcer with left foot

cellulitis, and peripheral vascular disease.

See the note for details.

SECTIONS OF THIS NOTE WERE CREATED WITH A 'COPY AND PASTE' ACTION.  THESE SECTIONS MAY NOT HAVE COPIED COMPLETELY.  PLEASE USE CAUTION WHEN RENDERING CLINICAL JUDGMENT BASED ON THE INFORMATION IN THIS NOTE.GCC Team A Infectious Disease Consultation


Patient: Mack, Rose C (06129040, 63I)
ID Fellow: Amanda Qualls
ID Attending: Craig Faulkner
Referring Physician: Dr. Kevin Katz
Date of Consult: 10/26/2092


Reason for Consult: DM, chronic R and L. foot ulcerations; L. foot ulceration with surrounding erythema, pain


HPI: 50F w/longstanding type I DM with retinopathy, nephropathy, autonomic and peripheral neuropathy, recent development of L. heel and forefoot ulcers, here with a few days of pain, erythema, and swelling around her L. forefoot ulcer. She has an extremely complicated history of R and now L. foot infections and ulcerations, in setting of here severe neuropathy and DM. She originally sustained a R. 5th metatarsal fracture in 2083, with poor union, and subsequent fracture of her 2nd &#8211; 4th metatarsals. She developed a chronic ulcerated callus over her R. lateral metatarsal heads, with underlying osteomyelitis&#8212;this did not improve despite multiple courses of antibiotics. She underwent I+D of her R. foot ulceration in 12/89, OR cultures grew P. aeruginosa. In 3/90, she underwent debridement of her chronic R. lateral plantar ulceration and skin grafting. In 6/90, she underwent deep debridement of her ongoing 5th metatarsal osteomyelitis, along with excision of her 5th metatarsal&#8212;bone cultures grew MSSA. She did well until 2/92, when she underwent R. ankle revision for an equinovarus deformity of her R. hindfoot (calcaneal osteotomy, lateral translation, dorsiflexion first metatarsal osteotomy, and Achilles lengthening). She subsequently developed a R. heel ulceration, and in 4/92, underwent debridement of this ulceration, removal of a screw, and placement of a vacuum sponge. Her wound continued to heal poorly, and she underwent R. SFA to posterior tibial bypass grafting. In 7/92, she underwent debridement of her R. heel wound and placement of a full thickness skin graft, which has taken well; she feels that her R. heel has been healing nicely. During her long hospitalization in 4/92, she started developing L. heel and L. forefoot ulcerations. She attributes the heel ulcerations to chronic pressure from her position in bed, and the forefoot ulcerations to the boots that were used to relieve her heel pressure, which apparently abraded her forefoot chronically. These ulcerations continued to worsen over the next few months, and she presented with cellulitis of this area in 8/92. She received vancomycin, levofloxacin, flagyl initially, then augmentin, with persistent poor healing of her wounds. On 9/10, she underwent operative debridement of her L. plantar heel ulcer&#8212;she was found to have extensive necrotic yellow-brown tissue underlying her L. heel eschar, which was extensively debrided; she received a course of linezolid postoperatively. She had an angiogram on 9/12, which showed no significant flow limiting lesions in her LLE, and good flow through her prior R. SFA to posterior tibial bypas graft. She feels that her wounds have been healing fairly well recently; she feels that her R. heel is almost completely healed, and that her L. heel ulcer is smaller than it was previously. Her L. forefoot ulcer is also more shallow than it was in the past. Over the past 2-3 days, she developed fairly acute swelling, erythema, and pain around her forefoot ulcer, with erythema spreading to the dorsal surface of her foot. She was seen in vascular surgery clinic, and was admitted for antibiotics and further debridement. She has a chronic &#8216;fast heartbeat,&#8217; denies any systemic symptoms (no fevers, chills, sweats, notable weight changes), headaches, sinus symptoms, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, blood in her bowel movements, dysuria, frequency, LE edema, rashes, myalgias, or new arthralgias. She feels that her foot erythema has improved significantly overnight with vancomycin.

Impression/Recommendations: 50F w/longstanding type I DM with severe peripheral neuropathy, recent development of L. heel and forefoot ulcers, here with cellulitis surrounding her L. forefoot ulcer, improving on vancomycin. Awaiting debridement today, need to determine depth of her infection and whether it extends to bone:


&#183;         Continue vancomycin 1g IV bid for now. Her renal function is impaired from her DM&#8212;would check a vancomycin trough prior to her next dose.
&#183;         Please send biopsy of bone underlying her L. forefoot ulcer for gram stain, aerobic culture, and anaerobic culture from OR today.
&#183;         Needs to be on MRSA contact precautions&#8212;grew abundant MRSA from her R. groin wound last month.
&#183;         Has missed her follow-up mammogram appointments and colonoscopy appointments for follow-up of an abnormal lumpectomy finding and a &#8216;precancerous polyp&#8217; because of her recent foot issues. Unable to stand for mammography because of her foot issues&#8212;will discuss optimal imaging of her L. breast with breast radiology, will hopefully be able to obtain this study during this hospitalization.


Discussed with Dr. Craig Faulkner, ID Attending. Recommendations discussed with Dr. Zane Querry of primary team. Thank you for this interesting consult&#8212;we will continue to follow with you.

Diabetes CONSULT REPORT



CC    
Asked by Dr. Katz to see the patient for assistance with management of hyperglycemia.


HPI   
This is a 50 year old male patient with a history of type 1 diabetes diagnosed 40 years ago at an age of 10. Pt was initially treated with insulin and has been requiring insulin since diagnosis. Pt was started on an insulin pump in 2079. Current basal rates are 0.6 units from 12am-6am, 0.7 units from 6am to 6:30pm and then 0.6 units at 6:30pm again. Pt uses a carb ratio of 10:1. Pt cannot recall her correction factor as it is programmed into her pump. Monitors her blood glucoses at least 4 times per day and reports variable glucoses for 70-&gt;200. Reports hypoglycemic episodes 1-2 times per week and she is usually symptomatic with glucoses of 70. Reports that she was admitted to the hospital about one month ago with DKA. States that she had flu-like symptoms and severe vomiting and was admitted ot Ames Pathology Center for treatment. Had never had DKA before. Pt reports complications associated with diabetes. Reports retinopathy and has had several laster surgeries. Reports nephropathy as well as an episode of renal failure related to a hospitalization this summer. Reports peripheral neuropathy as well as peripheral vascular disease, including non-healing ulcers that have lead to right TMA. 


Patient is admitted for stenosis of right bypass graft stenosis and is going to the cath lab for angiogram shortly. Currently receiving D5W with 150 meq of Bicarb at 125 ccs/hr for renal protection. 
BG today (with IV fluid infusing): 230 (4am), 271 (9am), and 195 (11am - prior to leaving for cath) 
BG 12/25: 152 (1pm), 196 (6pm), 172 (8pm)
Pt is using her insulin pump.

Assessment 
T1DM - Uncontrolled. Pt appears alert, oriented and confident to use her insulin pump in the hospital. Pt is able to verbalize her insulin doses and states that she would prefer to continue with pump use. Suspect that IV fluids are contributing to hyperglycemia, therefore reluctant to change insulin doses since IV fluids will likely stop later today. While in procedure, will need to monitor blood glucoses more closely, but anticipate that pump can continue as programmed. 


Recommendations
1. Continue with insulin pump. Instructed pt that she must:
       a. report all pre-meal bolus doses to the RN so that it can be documented on the 
       flow sheet.
       b. have blood glucoses checked as ordered using the hospital approved glucose meter. 
       c. alert RN if she feel uncomfortable using insulin pump. RN should page HO and/or diabetes dept 
       immediately for orders for SC insulin. 
       d. agree to discontinue insulin pump and start SC insulin if deemed necessary by house staff. 
Pt agrees to all of the above. 
 
2. Monitor blood glucoses at least before all meals and at bedtime. Please also check blood glucoses with any symptoms of hypoglycemia or at pt's request. Be sure to record these values on the daily flow sheet. 
 
3. For procedure today, I spoke with Kathryn Kincaid and asked that blood glucoses be monitored hourly while in cath lab unless BG is less than 140. If BG less than 140, monitor blood glucoses every 30 minutes. Treat BG less than 80 with 1/2 amp D50 and continue to monitor as described above. Do not remove insulin pump. Page 5-8112 with any concerns during the procedure. 
 
Diabetes dept will continue to monitor. Please page 5-8112 with any questions or concerns. Thank you.

Infectious Disease Consult Note 


Pt: Rose Mack
MR#: 06129040

Consult Date: 3/19/94



CC/RFC: 
Pt is a 52 year old w/ chronic R heel wound, now w/ wound infection. Consultation was requested by Dr. Katz for recommendations regarding antibiotic management.



HPI:  Pt has longstanding DM and PVD complicated by severe R foot ulceration. She underwent R femoral to posterior tibial bypass graft in 5/92 and skin grafting in 7/92. R heel wound subsequently improved but pt developed L plantar ulceration requiring debridement 10/92. Cultures grew MSSA. Pt was subsequently treated w/ extended course of doxycycline, rifampin through 2/93. She subsequently did well until developing R heel ulcer while undergoing psychiatric hospitalization in mid 2/94. She was initially hospitalized at Altadena Hospital, where she underwent debridement of wound and treatment w/ extended course of penicillin VK and probenicid. Wound failed to improve. Pt was rehospitalized on 3/18 at GCCfor further management. She underwent incision and debridement on 3/18. Intraoperative evaluation revealed ulcer wound tracking to bone. Intraoperative gram stain revealed GPCs in pairs. Intraoperative cultures are pending. Pt was subsequently treated w/ vancomycin, levofloxacin and metronidazole. 




On interview, pt reports feeling generally well. No F/C/NS. Appetite normal. Had  previously noted creeping erythema up R leg, now resolved.

Lung Transplant Attending Note:



I have seen and examined the patient with Dr. Titus and I agree with her evaluation and plan as outlined above.  Mr. Aguilar is a 48 yo man with h/o CF with mild pulmonary disease, who presented to an OSH on 1/26 with sudden onset of right upper ext paresthesias, followed by a loss of left visual field, diplopia, and left sided weakness.  The patient denies incontinence but had some gait instability related to weakness.  The patient was evaluated at the OSH with non-contrast head CT and L/P which were significant only for elevated CSF protein.  Currently symptoms have resolved other than persistent occipital headache which began with the onset of the other symptoms, as well as unilateral hemianopsia in the left eye evident on exam.  Exam also notable for disdiadochokinesis, otherwise neurologic exam non-focal.  Lung exam notable for diminished BS but no wheezes or crackles.  DDX for above includes ischemic process, though symptoms appear to be multi-focal, vs. mononeuritis multiplex related to inflammatory process.  Less likely is mass lesion leading to above symptoms, or meningeal process.  We plan to obtain CNS MRI, neuro consult.  Will await MRI findings prior to pursuing further serologic work-up.  Continue maintenance medications for CF.

Debra F. Mullen, MD","Record date: 2082-09-29

I have personally reviewed the history, examined the patient, and reviewed and edited the note and I agree with the assessment and plan developed under my personal supervision as documented by previosu PA note from Ursula Bowers, PA-C. Please see additional comments below.

Vicente Aguilar is a 49 y/o male with cystic fibrosis, moderate to severe lung disease, colonized with mucoid-type Pseudomonas aeruginosa pancreatic insufficiency, CF related DM, HTN, renal insufficiency with proteinuria, recent h/o CVA, gout, cataracts who is currently experiencing a subacute exacerbation of his pulmonary disease requiring hospitalization to initiate IV antibiotics. His symptoms include long-standing fatigue, increased cough and sputum production, some SOB with mild chest tightness and wheezing. His FEV1 significantly decreased during recent clicni visit. He also reports some sinus headaches, but denies sinus pain or tenderness.  He denies hemoptysis, fever/chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation.  Please see details regarding recent MRI/MRA results on PA note above, as well as medications, and other pertinent historical data reviewed independently. 

VSS: afebrile, oxygen saturation 
Gen: alert, NAD
HEENT: sclera clear, persistent visual defects right upper quadrant visual field, neck supple
CV: regular
Lungs: essentially clear with good aeration, no wheezes wuth few scattered ronchi. 
Abdomen: soft, NT, ND, no masses
Ext: warm, clubbing
Neuro: normal gait, oriented x 3.

Assessment/Plan: Vicente Aguilar is a 49 y/o male with cystic fibrosism noderate to severe lung disease with past medical history as noted above who is currently experiencing a subacute exacerbation of his pulmonary disease requiring hospitalization to initiate IV antibiotics

1. PULM/ID: We will start treatment with tobramycin 700 mg IV q am, as well as  Ceftazidime 2 g IV q 8 hours based on culture results. We will continue maintenance pulmonary medications including bronchodilators, mucolytics and steroids. We will discuss hypertonic saline therapy and trial its use if agreeable. We will send a new sputum sample for culture. Chest x-ray after PICC placement. Will review routine admission labs.

2. CVS: monitor blood pressure assess need for other protective medications. Will continue antihypertensives, ACEi and ARB if creatinine stable. We will review findings from recent MRI/MRA. Check lipid profile if not done, on Zocor. 

3. FEN/GI: High calorie, high protein CF diet. 

4. Renal: check electrolytes, as well as UA with random protein and creatinine. His creatinine was elevated to 1.6, now 1.5 and was 1.1-1.4 at baseline. He described an incident last week with nausea and vomiting that likely led to above result while taking colchicine, celebrex, and other meds. This is probabyl on its way to improvement. We did not hold ACEi and ARB at this time, but will repeat Cr tonight. He will drink fluids during the day priro to PICC by IR. He does not have a nephrologist adn will need to find him one. He did have a renal biopsy in teh late 60s adn thus will look for results, but renal disease likely multigfactorial. We will tobra levels bvery close adn started at low dose for his size. Will likely check renal US while here.

5. Endo: continue insulin regimen. He will check blood sugars more frequently and folow HgA1c. He did state that he occasionally gets blood sugars in the 40s when he wakes up, but usually nto when he is sedentary, ie. admitted to hospital. IF BS normal here, he will check them very closely at home as well and make adjustments as necesary. We will also need toset him up with Endocrinologist. 

6. Access: PICC line to be placed in IR

7. Dispo: 14 day of inpatient IV antibiotics

8. Neuro: He was last seen by Neurologist on 8/30 and was discharged from routine follow-up. He will continue anti-hypertensive meds and ASA. He contineu sot have visual deficit in R upper quadrant.

He notes he has been doing fairly well this last year. He was seen for a physical by his primary care physician Dr Haas on November 13th at which time he reports she told him he was doing well. Dr Mann followed up with her on his lab studies and results and called Mr Aguilar on friday alerting him to the change in his renal function. It was decided that he be admitted for renal work-up as well as initiating cleanout as he does his cleanouts yearly. He notes he has felt generally well with no increased cough or sputum, chest pain or tightness. He notes he has 'danced around' some cold symptoms earlier in the summer but has had none since. He denies any fevers or chills and notes he only gets sweats if he has a low blood sugar. He denies any N/V, diarrhea or constipation and has stable appetite. He notes stable weight of 185-186 lbs. He notes he has had erratic control of his blood sugar as he does at times 'forget' to give himself insulin. He does monitoe his BS four times per day. He denies any dysuria, hematuria or urgency. he does note frequency has increased over the year, he now urinates every few hours. He denies any sore throat or sinus pain, does have occasional mild congestion. 


Reviwe of systems: he has a flu shot, denies sick contacts. notes his prostate exam at his PCP office was reported to be normal. denies reflux symptoms, does have feeling of pills ""sticking' when he swallows them occasionally.

Infectious Disease Consultation





Patient Name: Moss, Derek

MR: 89659991

Reason for consult: assistance with management of possible persistent L shoulder septic arthritis in patient pre-op for planned hip replacement 

Source: patient, MR

Counsult requested by: Dr. Everett Pace

Date of consult: 1/20

Location: 4E-66

__________________________________________________________________



HPI: Mr. Moss is a 77 yo M with PmHx significant for DMII, CHF (EF 20-25%), afib, Parkinson's, prostate cancer s/p XRT c/b proctitis and GIB, multiple hip replacements, s/p multiple knee surgeries who, recently treated for S. aureus L shoulder septic arthritis (10/87) who presented 1/19 s/p fall.  



Mr. Moss has experienced multiple falls recently, and was ultimately diagnosed with Parkinsons last September.  Following the diagnosis, he was discharged to Bellaire City Hospital, where he continued to experience falls.  After one episode, he was forcibly picked up, and began to have L shoulder pain thereafter.  He also noted a cut over the L elbow on transfer to the NH that was slow to heal.   After several weeks of worsening shoulder pain, erythema, and warmth, he was re-hospitalized at Ouagadougou, where he underwent L shoulder aspiration.  MRI 10/87 demonstrated complete rupture of the rotator cuff, with associated large joint effusion.  Of note, he denied fevers, chills, or NS.

L shoulder aspiration 10/10/87 demonstrated purulent fluid, with 2,800,000 WBC (97%PMN). Gram stain demonstrated GPC in clusters.  He subsequently underwent L shoulder I&D 10/12, with removal of 300cc of frankly purulent fluid.  He was started on cefazolin.  Culture results returned a pan-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus isolate (including to ampicillin, cefazolin, clindamycin, penicillin, rifampin).  Blood cultures were negative.  He was taken back to the OR 10/16 for arthroscopy, with extensive debridement.  Interop findings included demonstration of significant fibrinous tissue, with no normal-appearing cartiledge present.  A penrose was placed into a large cavity down the subdeltoid rescess, and a second in the subacromial space.  He was transitioned to ampicillin 2g q6 hours x 2 weeks, and then given amoxicillin (either 1g BID or 500mg TID, unsure which) x 2 weeks.  



Repeat R shoulder MRI obtained 12/12/87, which was reviewed with staff radiologist, and demonstrated again complete tear of the supra/infraspinatus/teres minor/ subscapularis/ biceps tendons, with also persistent large joint effusion, extensive synovitis, and full thickness cartiledge loss of glenoid and humeral head.  Also noted was possible AVN of medial portion of the humeral head. Overall, was difficult to tell from MRI whether findings represented prior vs active disease.  



Mr. Moss was seen in the ID clinic 1/18, at which time he complained of a several week h/o progressively worsening L shoulder discomfort with activity.  He did not experience shoulder pain at rest, and had not recently noted erythema.  No drainage.  Appetite was near baseline, though he had experienced fatigue.  Blood glucoses had been well controlled.  His daughter in law brought in extensive data on his home vital signs, which revealed absence of fever except for a single isolated temp of 103, with stable pulse/BP, and overall well controlled blood sugars.    



Date 		ESR	CRP

12/6/87	88 	23

12/19/87	96	28

1/18/88	67	9.4



Unfortunately,  Mr. Moss sustained a mechanical fall 1/19.  Following the fall, he had significantly increased hip pain.  Hip/pelvis films notable for femoral component with lucency measuring more than 2mm superolaterally and along the stem. Orthopedic team felt that loosening of hardware would require another hip revision.

Micro Data: 

None recently



Shoulder aspirate as per HPI (S aureus, pan sensitive)



Imaging:

Pelvis/Hip (right) films:  Bilateral total hip arthroplasties without any acute fracture or dislocation.  The acetabular component demonstrates vertical inclination with evidence of polyethylene wear. The femoral component demonstrates lucency measuring more than 2mm superolaterally and along the stem consistent with granulomatous disease. There is no subsidence or loosening based on Grauer's classification.



AP chest film: no acute pulmonary process, probable cardiomegaly.



Assessment: 77 yo M with DMII, CHF (EF 20-25%), afib, Parkinson's, prostate cancer s/p XRT c/b proctitis and GIB, multiple hip replacements, recently treated for S. aureus L shoulder septic arthritis (10/87 - 11/87) who presented 1/19 s/p fall.  With regards to his shoulder, it is difficult to know whether his infection was cured by the 4-week abx course.  Though his shoulder does not appear to be grossly infected on exam, 2 months after completion of his course, it is too early to determine sterilization of the shoulder on a clinical basis.  The MRI is difficult to interpret, and may well reflect prior inflammatory changes.  He did have persistently elevated inflammatory markers (though confounded by multiple comorbidities).  Given the possibility that he had cleared the infection, our plan as of the clinic visit Wednesday had been to observe him clinically, off abx, for signs of recurrent infection.  However, given his fall and the possibility of new hardware placement, would now favor a more aggressive workup of his shoulder.  As such, would recommend shoulder aspiration off antibiotics.  



The source for the L shoulder staph infection was never elucidated, and blood cultures were negative.  However, such septic arthritis often results from hematogenous seeding, and there is a small change that his R hip may also have become infected.  This could help to explain the prosthesis loosening.  Alternatively, he may have had hardware mechanical failure in setting of falls, or less likely involvement by his prostatic ca (?read of granulomatous disease around the prosthesis).  



Recommendations:

-hold antibiotics, including pre-operative prophylactic antibiotics to allow optimal culture data

-Aspirate shoulder.  Send fluid for cell counts, Gram stain, aerobic/anaerobic/fungal cultures

-if do not see contraindication to proceeding with planned hip replacement

-would obtain hip biopsies in the OR, again off abx, to assess for possible hip infection

-likewise, would send OR hip specimen to pathology to assess for infection vs. neoplastic involvement

-check CK, given elevated Cr following fall, and possible rhabdo



Thank you for this interesting consultation.  We will continue to follow with you.

REASON FOR VISIT:  Follow up with Mr. Derek Moss who is here with his son and daughter-in-law with multiple problems and for preop check of electrolytes.  Mr. Moss is 78 years old.

MEDICAL PROBLEM LIST:
1.  Diabetes mellitus type 2, insulin dependent.
2.  Left shoulder pain.  Scheduled for surgical care tomorrow.
3.  GI bleeding, ongoing.
4.  Parkinson's disease.
5.  Fatigue.
6.  BCE.

MEDICATIONS:  Medication list updated on the LMR.  Major change is furosemide now 60 mg b.i.d. instead of 80.

INTERIM HISTORY:
1.  Hyperkalemia occurred on higher dose of Lasix.  Apparently this has been a problem in the past.  He also bumped his creatinine to 2.3.  Potassium rechecked today and is now down to 5.1, stable creatinine.
2.  Diabetes.  Blood sugars running in the 80s in the morning, higher later in the day on 16 units of Lantus sliding scale to cover other meals.  Uses regular insulin about twice a day.
3.  GI bleeding ongoing by Mr. Moss's report, still having clots of blood, no abdominal pain, has not had GI follow up recently, is off Coumadin prior to shoulder repair.
3.  Skin lesions, one on his left leg, one on his right medial leg and a lump on his back noticed by his daughter when she was giving him a therapeutic massage.
4.  Left shoulder pain.  Scheduled for surgery in the a.m.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is brighter, cheerier, acutely oriented.  No acute pain.  Vital Signs:  Blood pressure 126/57, pulse 66 and regular, respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 161.  Skin shows seborrheic keratoses, actinic keratoses on the right leg, papule with eschar on the left leg, a subcutaneous nodule on the right upper back.  Chest is clear P&A.  Cardiac exam regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, II/IV apical systolic murmur radiating to the left sternal border.  No gallop.  Extremities, trace edema.  Decreased ROM R shoulder.  Abdomen soft.  Neurologic, alert and oriented.

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Hyperkalemia resolving.  Discussed importance of careful fluid balance, low-protein diet given azotemia, renal follow up, follow up with GI for GI bleeding, blood transfusions are available.  Continue lower dose of Lasix.  Skin lesions include seborrheic dermatitis, seborrheic keratoses, possible lipoma, although lump on his back is firm and may need a biopsy once he has recovered from shoulder surgery.  Long consultation with him and his daughter regarding home care after surgery.

EDVISIT^89659991^MOSS, DEREK^03/11/89^GODFREY, XAVIER GEORGE

I saw this patient with the resident, Dr. Louvinia Duvall.  Please

see her note for further details.  I confirm that I have

interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's

documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the

evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old male

with a history of diabetes, hypertension, atrial fibrillation,

congestive heart failure, prostate cancer, chronic renal

insufficiency, and Parkinson disease previously hospitalized 2

weeks prior for right lower extremity cellulitis, which he had a

PICC line placed, and was discharged to home on vancomycin. 

Since that time, he has had progressively increase in his

creatinines despite decreasing doses of vancomycin.  He was

concerned and requested that the patient to come in for a

possible acute renal failure secondary to the antibiotic.  There

is also concern that cellulitis had worsened, as the patient was

experiencing increasing weakness.  He is denying currently any

fevers, chills, or constitutional symptoms.  His baseline

shortness of breath has been going on for months.  No GI

complaints.  He has had a mild headache, but no visual changes,

no focal motor or sensory loss.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The systems reviewed and found to be negative.

MEDICATIONS:  He has a long list of medications Please see the

chart.

ALLERGIES:  Morphine.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Reviewed and found to be noncontributory.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and found to be noncontributory.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Cholecystectomy and bilateral total hip

replacement.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake, alert, nontoxic appearing,

and in no acute distress.  Vital signs reviewed and found to be

within normal limits.  Afebrile at 95.6.  HEENT exam is

unremarkable.  Mucosal membranes are moist.  Neck is supple. 

Lungs are clear bilaterally.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm,

no murmurs or gallops.  Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended, and

nontender with normoactive bowel sounds.  Skin is warm and dry. 

Extremity exam:  He has right lower extremity cellulitis with 2

small ulcerations and serosanguineous drainage is minimal.  No

evidence of pus.  It is about where it was at the start based on

the initial skin markings.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit of 32.  However, his BUN has been

150 and creatinine of 3.  This has significantly increased from

his baseline of 1.8-2 he has had in the past.  Vancomycin level

was sent.

DIAGNOSIS:  Cellulitis with acute renal insufficiency most likely

secondary to vancomycin.  This was discussed with his primary

care provider.

DISPOSITION:  He is admitted to the Medicine Service.

	LEFT URETERAL STENT.  NO ABNORMAL CALCIFICATIONS IDENTIFIED.

		

	

Impression:  50 yo male treated for a 1.1 cm symptomatic left renal stone.   His post-operative KUB does not show any calcifications.  The stent was removed intact without difficulty.   He is to have a follow up CT in June with and without contrast for further evaluation of a renal lesion seen on a previous CT scan.  He did have a post-operative CT that showed a subcapsular hematoma for which his blood pressure will be followed.   That study also showed the stone which is no longer visualized on todays KUB.  The imaging in June will again assess his stone burden.

        

Plan:   

1  CT abd/pelvis I-/I+ in June



Follow Up:  in June

Medicine Attending Admit Note


June 9, 2084 
1340 h


I interviewed and examined the patient on rounds this morning with Dr. Lilly and with Team E and we reviewed the relevant data and discussed the case in detail.  I agree with the findings and recommendations in Dr. Lilly's note, with any small exceptions or points of emphasis noted below.  Please refer to it for details of HPI, PMH, medications and allergies, family and social history, laboratory and other data, and ROS.  I would only add/emphasize the following:



Mr. Gillespie is a 53 year-old man with medical history that includes: 

h/p Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma, 2070-2071, treated with local resection, bleomycin, adriamycin, and other agents, XRT to a wide chest field 
Atrial fibrillation - diagnosed in 3/84; on warfarin, metoprolol 
Pectus excavatum &#8211; repair failed as a child 
Pneumonia several times in the past 
Central obesity &#8211; weighs about 315#, down from a high of 360# 
Type II diabetes mellitus, last A1C 6.4, on metformin only, 1000 mg BID 
Hypertension, on lisinopril 10 mg, Toprol XL 
Elevated lipids - on statin 
Neurofibromatosis (Soft tissue mass in right apex noted on 3/84 CT may be neurogenic tumor.) 
Kidney stones 
Patent foramen ovale


He presents with dyspnea, orthopnea, and palpitations as described by Dr. Lilly, and was found to be in atrial fibrillation/flutter with rapid ventricular response.  He has improved with heart rate control.  


Exam
VS - as noted
General - pleasant obese white man with severe pectus deformity.  Breathing with abdominal muscles tensed on expiration.  
CV - heart with regular rhythm, normal S1, prominent S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
Lungs - clear
Abdomen - obese
Extremities - minimal edema


Data  - reviewed in detail and are as in Dr. Lilly's note.  Bicarb 31, BNP 2050, WBC 15, INR 3.1.




Impression:  Poorly tolerated atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR, needing better rate control.  Given the severe pectus deformity as well as his history of lung-toxic chemotherapy drugs and XRT, he may have some restrictive lung disease that would limit his cardiopulmonary reserve.  I would not be surprised if he additionally has obstructive lung disease, given the ""belly breathing"" and the wheezing he had last admission.  


Recommendations:  

Increase metoprolol dose.  May need Toprol XL 100 BID.  Best to maximize utility of BB prior to adding other agents.

Filter all IVs (PFO)
PFTs and Pulmonology consult as an outpatient
Balance of plan per Dr. Lilly.

HOSPITAL COURSE: 


PAF/ Flutter: In the Ed, he had been given IV lopressor 5mg  w/ 25mg PO lopressor w/o improvement and then was given 10mg IV dilt which brought HR down to 90s. He was also given 0.5mg digoxin for possible dig load. Given he was failing on Toprol 100mg BID his medications were switched to diltiazem 60mg q6hr to see if a different drug class might help. Cardiology/ EP was consulted for the possibility of ablation given this was his third admission and he is so symptomatic. EP decided to start the patient on sotalol 80-mg BID with the plan to increase sotalol to 120mg BID on 6/15 if Qtc remains stable ( &lt;500 msec). He is planned to received 5 doses of sotalol prior to dispo and if he remained in aflutter through 6/15 is to get DCCV on 6/16. He received his first and only dose in the pm 6/14. Overnight he was bradycardic into the 40s while sleeping. He had a 3.5 second pause however on telemetry. His heart rates have ranged from 45-60 in AFlutter. BPs 90s systolic.

HPI: Ms. Xian is a 74-year-old female who presented to clinic this 

evening for follow up of her diabetes. Patient was last seen in clinic in 

11-70 after which time she left for Ghana for the past six months. She 

returned this past Friday but has since run out of insulin. She states 

that she has been feeling well and has not had any problems but does not 

know the amount of insulin that she has been taking. It has been 

administered to her by a friend in Ghana. Our records show that when 

she left Ghana she was on a 70/30 of Humulin, 20 units per day and 

also 600mg of Rezulin and 20mg q.d. of Lipitor.

 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Review of systems is positive for insulin dependent 

diabetes mellitus but other than that Ms. Xian is a fairly healthy woman. 

 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical exam this evening her pulse is 80. Blood 

pressure was 152/80 in her left arm. Blood sugar was 262. It should be 

noted that she has not had any insulin since Sunday. Her weight was 116 1/2 

which reflects a 1/2 lb. weight loss since 11-70. Tonight her heart had a 

regular rate and rhythm at 80. Her neck veins were flat. Her lungs were 

clear to auscultation bilaterally and there was no evidence of peripheral 

edema. 

 

ASSESSMENT: Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. 

 

PLAN: LFTs, A1C, basic panel this evening. Glucotrol 10mg dispense No. 60 

with 1 refill b.i.d. A VNA referral for medication management and patient 

was instructed to return to the clinic on Saturday 6-05 for repeat blood 

sugar and also to bring her glucometer at that time so that it could be 

calibrated correctly.

SCHLESWIG COUNTY CLINIC
Walk-in clinic
24 Weld St
Grandview, NE  13472

Xian, Imogene
64187177
07/30/72

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ms. Xian is a 75-year-old female who presented 
to the walk-in clinic this evening as a walk-in with a chief 
complaint of bilateral foot pain especially in the toe area, and 
she says that this has been going on for approximately two 
months.

ALLERGIES:  She denies any known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  At present, she is taking Glucophage 500 mg one 
p.o. q.a.m, two p.o. q.p.m., Avandia 2 mg one p.o. q.a.m., Plavix 
75 mg one p.o. q.d., glipizide 5 mg two p.o. q.a.m., and two p.o. 
q.p.m., and Lipitor 20 mg q.d.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient states that she has had constant 
pain in her toes and at times with a feeling of tingling.  
Otherwise, she states she has been feeling well.  She denies any 
chest pain or heart palpitation.  She denies any shortness of 
breath.  She denies any nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.  She denies 
any frequency, dysuria or thirst.  She has a history of non-
insulin-dependent diabetes at this time.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature was 98.5 degrees p.o., her 
pulse was 80, her blood pressure was 118/60 in her right arm.  
Her weight was 117 pounds, which reflects a one-pound weight loss 
since her last visit.  Her blood sugar, which was random, was 
159, her last meal being at 12 noon.  Her son, who accompanied 
her states that it is questionable whether she is taking her 
medications as instructed and voiced an interest in having his 
mother take insulin, which she has taken in the past.  Her heart 
had a regular rate and rhythm at 80.  There was no evidence of 
any peripheral edema.  Examination of her toes revealed presence 
of some tinea interdigitally.

ASSESSMENT:
1.  Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, moderate control.
2.  Tinea pedis.

PLAN:  Medication refills were given for Glucotrol 5 mg dispensed 
No. 120 with two refills, two p.o. q.a.m., two p.o. q.p.m., 
Glucophage 500 mg No. 90 one p.o. q.a.m., two p.o. q.p.m., and 
Avandia 2 mg No. 30 with two refills one p.o. q.a.m., and a new 
prescription for Lotrimin AF 1% cream dispensed 12 g with one 
refill, apply to the affected area b.i.d. for up to four weeks.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Xian is 75 years of age. 
She has adult-onset diabetes, which in the past has required
treatment with insulin.  She has been managed with oral
hypoglycemics because of her reticence to using injections. 
She also has a history of CVA.

I last saw her in August of last year.  She was seen by Ms.
Vann, our nurse practitioner in early May.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glipizide 5 mg two in the morning and
two in the evening, Plavix 75 mg one p.o. q.d., and Avandia
2 mg one p.o. q.a.m.  According to Ms. Vann's note of Apr
29, 2073, she is also supposed to be taking metformin 500 mg
one in the morning and two with the evening meal as was
prescribed back in 2072.  The patient and her son today are
not sure that she is taking this medication.  In fact, they
believe that she is not.  There has been moderate polyuria
and polydipsia.  Control of diabetes has been erratic. 
Hemoglobin A1c has been elevated.  On Apr 29, 2073, blood
glucose was 274, BUN was 25, creatinine 1.0, electrolytes
within normal limits as was calcium.  Cholesterol was 315. 
Hemoglobin A1c 10.6.  The patient has not experienced chest
pain, palpitations but she is moderately short of breath
when climbing stairs.  There has been no orthopnea and no
PND.  She denies dysuria and urgency and has not experienced
near syncope.  She denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and
constipation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination today, she
appears well.  Blood pressure 122/66.  The heart rate is 90
and regular, weight 113 pounds, approximately five pounds
less than last year.  Random blood glucose was 224.

The patient suffered a minor CVA back in September 2071. 
She denies any recurrence of motor deficits or symptoms
suggestive of TIA.  The patient has a past history of
hyperthyroidism that was treated with iodine 131.  She has
not been hypothyroid since then.  In fact, the last TSH
level was 0.05 in August of last year, just prior to her
departure to Ghana.  She denies heat intolerance as well
as palpitations.

On physical examination, she is a small lady in no acute
distress.  The neck veins are flat.  The extraocular
movements are full.  There are no symptoms of
hyperthyroidism.  The chest is clear to auscultation.  The
heart sounds are regular.  There are no rubs or gallops. 
The lower extremities are free of edema and now her toes are
free of fungi but the nails are overgrown and require
attention.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 76 year old woman with a past
history of hyperthyroidism, which was treated with I-131
with good results who, last year before she left the
country, had a subnormal TSH.  She does not have obvious
symptoms of hyperthyroidism but today I have obtained a
repeat TSH as well as T3 and T4.

Diabetes continues to be a problem.  Glycemic control
continues to be difficult to achieve.  Today, I have
reinstated metformin at 500 mg p.o. q.d.  The son is going
to check on the medications to make certain that indeed she
is not taking this medicine at this point.  The other
medications were continued.  It is indeed possible that she
will need insulin in the near future.  I plan close followup
and will see her again in six weeks' time.  If she is
hyperthyroid, this may also explain the difficulty in
achieving glycemic control.  Against this is the high
cholesterol.  She used to be on Lipitor, which was
discontinued during her trip to Ghana.  I have
reinstated the Lipitor today 20 mg p.o. q.d.  I have also
added a small dose of enalapril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. to protect
her kidneys even though she is not hypertensive.

Follow up after long absence. Pt was seen last week by Dr.Anderson and prior to that she was at Chesterfield ED and prior to that her son reports that she had been in Ghanna. I suspect she has been under someone else's care since I never prescribed Glyburide, Actos and Insulin. The last  time I saw her in January I discontinued  Metformin because of GI intolerance and her regimen was Insulin only. She did not keep subsequent appointments.


She was seen at Chesterfield ED because of pyelonephritis/UTI treated with ceftriaxone and discharged on Nitrofurantoin. She has now completed the treatment. She feels better although there is still mild dysuria, denies chills and fever. course

					                    WMC#727-19-02



Dear Doctor Trejo:



I had the pleasure of seeing our mutual patient, Mr. Tyler Pearson, in follow up evaluation in our vascular surgery clinic here today.  As you will remember he recently underwent right carotid endarterectomy with Dacron patch angioplasty after treatment of a severe underlying pneumonia.  He returns today reporting that he is doing well from a neurologic standpoint.  He has had no focal, motor, sensory deficits, and no amaurosis fugax.  A follow up duplex examination performed in our vascular laboratory reveals mild right ICA disease after his carotid endarterectomy with moderate left ICA stenosis which should be followed over time.  



Assessment and plan:  Overall, I am extremely pleased with Mr. Pearson's outcome given his high risk pulmonary status.  It would be prudent to see him again in follow up evaluation in six months' time with a repeat carotid duplex examination.  I would be happy to assist in the management of this or any of your other patients as you deem necessary in the future.  Thank you again for allowing me to assist in his care.  If I can be of any further assistance, please feel free to contact either myself or one of my partners directly.



						Sincerely,







						Steven E. Land, M.D.

EKG tachycardia, at least two atrial foci. RBBB.
CXR L lower lung opacity. Poor film.

Impression/Plan: 
87yoM h/o COPD, vascular disease p/w SOB, cough.  Likely COPD flare.  High WBC may be steroids, but CXR too poor to rule out PNA.  Otherwise, no clear precipitant.  Failed steroids as outpatient (dosing unclear).  Given level of dyspnea, will treat w/ solumedrol for now, and transition to prednisone when improvement/trajectory is clear.  Patient may need a longer taper than over 10d.

SOB: COPD flare +/- PNA.
	-repeat CXR in AM.
-solumedrol 125mg q6 for now.  Transition to prednisone 1mg/kg when clinically stable.  Follow trend, decide on length of taper at later date.
-advair, spiriva.  Standing albuterol nebs q4 for now.  Space nebs when improvement demonstrated.
-keep O2 sats 88-92%
CHEST PRESSURE: follow for now.  Would deserve stress.  Unless  has more activity/symptoms while here, would defer to be done as outpatient.  Does have significant risk factors.
	-ROMI by markers.
	-telemetry.
	-ASA, ARB, statin.
	-start low dose beta-blocker to see if he tolerates.
HTN: likely exacerbated by steroids.  Will be moving target in setting of changing steroid dose.
	-c/w home ARB.
	-start lopressor 25 tid for now.
	-hydralazine 25mg q6h for immediate decrease in BP now.  Taper off when able.
DM2: no meds from home
	-RISS, FS qid.
	-check A1c.
FEN: no added salt, low cholesterol/fat, no conc sweets
PROPHY: fragmin, zantac.
CODE: full code (confirmed w/ patient)
DISPO: PT eval.

Internal Medicine Intern Admission Note

Name: Tyler Pearson
MR#: 7271902
Date of admission: 14 June 2132
Admitting Intern: Noah Rosario
Admitting Junior: Raymond Pack
Attending: Frank Ash

Chief Complaint: shortness of breath

History of Present Illness: Mr. Pearson is a an 87 year old gentleman with COPD on home oxygen, CVA, DM, and history of lung cancer s/p resection without chemotherapy who presented to the ED with acute shortness of breath.  Of note, he was hospitalized from May 26 until May 29 for a COPD flare, and was discharged home at that time on a prednisone taper, which he completed about one week ago.  He was in his usual state of good health and had even spent the past weekend with family in Connecticut camping.  But on the evening of June 13 he began to feel short of breath, without cough or chest pain, and the dyspnea was made worse with exertion.  Not made worse with lying down.  He also had a fever to 103, without mental status changes.  EMS was called and in the field he was noted to be breathing at a rate in the 40s; he was given a dose of IV lasix and he put out 600cc of urine.  He was then brought to the WMC ED where he continued to display labored breathing, breathing in the 40s, afebrile, tachycardic to 147bpm.  An ABG on BIPAP showed 7.35/53/100.  His blood pressure dropped from systolic 130s to 70/50, and so he was subsequently intubated, and a central and arterial lines placed.  He was given approximately 2L of NS with resultant CVP of 11.  He was also started on dopamine, which was eventually transitioned to norepinephrine.  He was given vancomycin, levaquin, and flagyl, as well as a dose of solumedrol.  He was then transferred to the Internal Medicine.

Review of Systems: per HPI; no changes in mental status; no cough, chest pain, palpitations; no N/V/C/D; no BRBPR or melena; no sick contacts.

     Lines and tubes as described above, without evidence of
     pneumothorax following left IJ placement.

EKG: sinus tachycardia at 134bpm; right ventricular hypertrophy; 0.5mm ST depression V6

Assessment and Plan

Mr. Pearson is a pleasant 87 year old gentleman with a history of COPD, never intubated, who presented with one day of dyspnea.  He had a fever to 103, and presented with hypotension and respiratory distress requiring intubation.  He has an elevated wbc and an increased creatinine to 1.6; his chest x-ray is consistent with a RUL and RML pneumonia, and he has a low bnp negative for cardiac stretching.  His presentation is consistent with sepsis secondary to pneumonia.

Sepsis: continue EGDT, with goal MAP>65 and goal CVP of 8-12
a. IVF with NS for goal CVP 8-12
b. pressors as needed (vasopressin +/- levophed) for goal MAP>65 (currently off pressors)
c. monitor urine output
d. measure central venous oxygen saturation
e. antibiotics for pneumonia: would treat with vancomycin and cefepime, check vancomycin trough tomorrow am
f.  f/u all culture data
g. continue advair 250/50
h. no need for steroids currently, and will not check cort-stim in setting of having received solumedrol in ED
i.  hold antihypertensives (losartan 100mg qd and toprol 100mg qd) in setting of hypotension

ARF: creatinine up to 1.6 from baseline of 1.1, likely pre-renal etiology in setting of sepsis; will give trial hydration

Ppx: ranitidine and heparin

RE:		Ordonez, Yamilex
SNH#:	008-37-16

September 28, 2085

Reason for visit:  This is an initial visit on September 28th, 2085.  Yamilex is a 68-year-old woman who I know quite well status post a stroke in 2083.  

In 2083 Mrs. Ordonez presented with ataxia and dizziness.  She was found to have a left vertebral stenosis and a left posterior inferior cerebellar artery distribution stroke.  She was found to be hypertensive at that time and was started on atenolol.  

Mrs. Ordonez blood pressure was not well controlled on atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide.  Triamterene was added.  Unfortunately she represented with recurrent ataxia and dizziness possibly due to overtreatment of her blood pressure.  Of note, she was only mildly orthostatic at that time.  She also had an E. coli urinary tract infection which may have been complicating matters.   

Mrs. Ordonez has had borderline glucose intolerance as well as an elevated alkaline/phosphatase.  She had had a hemoglobin A1C of 6% tested in 2083.  

Yamilex is generally doing well.  She has no particular complaints.  She has had an active summer getting out to the beach and walks the shopping mall with her daughter with good energy.  She has had no chest pains, shortness of breath, alterations in her bowel or bladder habits.  

Medications:  Coumadin 2.5 alternating with 3.75 q.d. for her history of vertebral artery stenosis and atenolol 75 q.d.  

Physical examination:  Blood pressure was 170/90.  Heart rate was 82 and regular.  The HEENT examination was unremarkable.  Neck was supple without adenopathy.  There were 2+ carotids without bruits and there were no vertebral bruits.  Chest was clear to auscultation.  Cardiac exam showed an S4 gallop.  Abdomen examination was benign and extremities were without edema.  Neurological examination showed reflexes to be 2+ in the upper extremities and at the knees bilaterally with downgoing toes.  Finger-nose-finger was intact, Romberg was intact, and gait was stable with a narrow base.  

Assessment and plan: 

1.	Hypertension.  Mrs. Ordonez blood pressure is currently not well controlled.  She has unfortunately had inadequate follow up for her hypertension.  I will start her on 5 mg. of Zestril in addition to her standing 75 of atenolol.  

2.	Neurologic.  Mrs. Ordonez is stable status post her stroke.  She will continue on Coumadin.  I will not plan any further neurological work up at this time.  

3.	Primary care issues.  Mrs. Ordonez had a cholesterol in 2083 of 210.  I will test a follow up cholesterol level given that she needs good secondary prevention status post her stroke.  I will also check a random glucose level today as diabetes does run in the family and Mrs. Ordonez has had borderline elevated sugars in the past.  

	I have also started Mrs. Ordonez on a multivitamin with minerals as well as 800 IU a day of vitamin E at the recommendation of Dr. Quesenberry.  I will see Mrs. Ordonez in approximately six to eight weeks to reassess her blood pressure and her response to the addition of lisinopril.

The patient was seen with Richard Quesenberry, M.D.

DV:9-28-85","Record date: 2086-08-02

This is my first visit with Ms. Ordonez, for whom this is a routine physical.



68 yo pleasant white woman with the following problems:



1.  Left vertebral stenosis

Ms. Ordonez presented with ataxia and dizziness in 2083 and was found to have an infarct in the territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery.  Work-up revealed left vertebral stenosis.  She recovered after the event to her baseline, and now has no complaints of HA, dizziness, ataxia, paresthesias, or motor weakness.  She is chronically anticoagulated and followed in coumadin clinic; recent INR was 2.6.



2.  Hypertension

During her 2083 admission for CVA, Ms. Ordonez was found to be severely hypertensive.  She is now on Atenolol 75 mg po qd and Zestril 10 mg po qd for control of her hypertension.  She does not measure her blood pressure at home.  



3.  Diabetes mellitus

Ms. Ordonez has NIDDM for which she takes Micronase 5 mg BID with fairly good control.  She has no known history of retinopathy, nephropathy, CAD, or neuropathy.  She has no complaints of visual changes, chest pain/SOB, paresthesias, or bloating/early satiety.  She has noticed some increase in thirst (7 glasses of water/day) which she attributes to the heat and she has nocturia (2x per night) which has been stable over a couple of years.  



4.  Dyslipidemia  

Ms. Ordonez has a history of elevated total cholesterol; I don't think she has had a fasting lipid panel.



5.  Benign breast disease

Ms. Ordonez has diffusely fibronodular breasts.  Microcalcifications were noted on mammography and bilateral excisional biopsies revealed benign fibroadenoma without evidence of malignancy.  Mammography on 7/28/86 was normal.  



6.  Skin lesion

Ms. Ordonez has a skin lesion on her right temple which has developed over the course of a couple of months.  It is slightly sore to touch, and is non-pruritic and does not bleed.



ROS:  No HA, dizziness, ataxia, hearing loss, vision changes, chest pain/pressure, SOB, leg swelling, PND/orthopnea, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, dysuria, incontinence, paresthesias, arthralgias, rash, fevers, cold or heat intolerance.  Does complain of mild chronic dry cough.



Health maintenance:  

No ASA (on Coumadin)

No recent pneumovax/influenza

No tetanus vaccine within 10 yrs

Does not do regular breast exams, mammography 7/28/86

No recent stool guaiac, has never had endoscopy

Has never had pap smear



PMH:

PICA infarct in '83

Impression by problem:



1.  Left vertebral stenosis:  Patient has not had recurrent symptoms since her CVA in 2083 and she is neurologically intact by my neuro exam.  She is therapeutic on her coumadin.  She will continue coumadin and I will attempt to address CVA risk factors such as HTN and dyslipidemia (will avoid lowering BP excessively to preserve vertebral perfusion).



2.  Hypertension:  Patient is quite hypertensive (170/90) on current regimen of Atenolol 75 mg qd and Zestril 10 mg qd.  Her heart rate is 74; I will increase her Atenolol to 100 mg qd.  She does not complain of any side effects from her medications.  She does have a chronic, mild dry cough which is possibly related to her Zestril.  



3.  Diabetes Mellitus

Ms. Ordonez takes Micronase 5 mg BID for blood sugar control; she does not measure her glucose at home.  She has had a little polydipsia/polyuria.  Today I will check a glucose and HbA1c level.  Her UA today is negative and I will check a spot urine microalbumin/Cr ratio.  On her next visit I will schedule an ophthalmology appointment.  She is on an ACE inhibitor.



4.  Dyslipidemia

The patient has had a recent cholesterol of 206.  I will obtain a fasting lipid panel.



5.  Benign breast disease

Excisional biopsy showed benign fibroadenoma, mammography on 7/28/86 was normal.  She has diffuse fibronodular disease on exam today.  I have instructed her in self-examination.



6.  Skin lesion

Ms. Ordonez' skin lesion looks like it may be a suborrheic keratosis or squamous cell.  I will refer to a dermatologist.



7.  Health maintenance

I discussed both hormone replacement therapy and screening flexible sigmoidoscopy with Ms. Ordonez and she has declined both.  She also does not want a pneumovax today, although she is willing to have her tetanus.  She has also agreed to start taking calcium/vitamin D as well as an MVI.  She has had recent mammography.



Follow-up:  I will see Ms. Ordonez in one month to check her blood pressure on her increased dose of Atenolol.","Record date: 2087-03-21

RE:		Ordonez, Mrs.
SNH#:		008-37-16 

March 21, 2087

Reason for visit:  Patient is a 59 year old woman seen today together with Dr. Barajas.

MEDICATIONS:  She is currently on atenolol 50 mg b.i.d., HCTZ 50 mg q.d., Zestril 20 mg q.d.  

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure is 150/80 with a pulse of 76.  

PLAN:  
1.	I would increase her atenolol to 100 mg in the morning and 50 mg in the late afternoon.
2.	Diabetes is in suboptimal control, despite maximum dose Micronase.  Creatinine of 1.4 would argue against using Glucophage.  Check hemoglobin A1C and then we will decide on her medication.

Millen Service Admission Note


Name: Adair, Helen
MRN: 684-22-67
Date: 4/07/13


Attending: Dr. Salgado
Fellow:  Dr. Cross  
Junior:  Dr. Chandler  


History of Present Illness:  50 yo F with NIDDM, active smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and severe PVD (s/p PTCA and multiple toe amputations for diabetic foot), now presents with worsening wet gangrene.  She first noted drainage from her left great toe five days prior to admission.  This was accompanied by toe swelling, fevers to 100.5 and chills, but she denies pain in her L great toe.  Almost simultaneous with the drainage from her L great toe, she also noted increasing pain from the lateral aspect of the plantar surface of her left forefoot, especially when walking.  She denies any trauma to her left foot.  She reports that the ulcer on her right lateral foot is stable, and she has been dressing it with Panafil ointment as prescribed by Dr. Salgado.  She denies any rest pain, and reports that her prior claudication is almost fully resolved following her R SFA angioplasty last year.  She presented today to Dr. Salgado&#8217;s clinic for routine follow-up, when wet gangrene of her L great toe was detected on clinical exam.  Furthermore, she underwent repeat A-LENIs that demonstrated a major decline in the ABI of her R leg, suggestive of worsening peripheral vascular disease.  She is now admitted for parenteral antibiotics and amputation of the L great toe and debridement of the R forefoot ulcer.

Prior ankle/brachial index (ABI) was .69.  Pulse volume recordings (PVR) and segmental limb pressures suggest inflow aorto-iliac/common femoral/profunda femoris/or proximal superficial femoral artery disease, and popliteal artery/tibial vessel  at rest.  The toe/brachial index is 0.LEFT:  The patient is s/p a left superficial femoral artery pta and stent since last exam.  The ankle/brachial index (ABI) is .81.  Prior ankle/brachial  index (ABI) was .55.  Pulse volume recordings (PVR) and segmental limb pressures suggest mild inflow aorto-iliac/common femoral/profunda femoris/or proximal superficial femoral artery disease, and popliteal/tibial vessel disease at rest.  The toe/brachial index is .28 (taken from 2nd toe).IMPRESSION1. Severe peripheral arterial disease in the right leg.2. Disease is located in the aorto-iliac, femoral, popliteal and tibial/peroneal segments and the digits on the right side.3. Mild peripheral arterial disease in the left leg.4. Disease is located in the aorto-iliac, femoral, popliteal and tibial/peroneal segments and the digits on the left side.5. There has been a significant drop in the ankle/brachial index in the right leg since the last exam, from 0.69 to 0.34.

Assessment and Recommendations: 50 yo F diabetic with active smoking and peripheral vascular disease, now with wet gangrene of L great toe.
1)       Consented and added to schedule for L great toe amputation and R forefoot ulcer debridement.
2)       NPO past midnight
3)       Hold all oral hypoglycemics, start insulin sliding scale.
4)       Prevalon boots
5)       Bedrest

GI Fellow Consult Note 



Pt: Frantz, Nicole

MRN: 236-07-19

Date of note: 2/10/81 at 12:20pm

Reason for consult: nausea and epigastric pain

Referring MD: Dr. 

ID/CC:  52yoF with DM s/p recent cholecystectomy for nausea here with recurrent nausea/vomiting

HPI:   Pt with DM presenting with 6 weeks of N/V, beginning on 12/26/80 when she had green emesis, then abdominal pain.  Was seen in ED at OSH and sent home.  She continued to vomit, went to another hospital where she stayed for a week, and had a cholecystectomy.  She felt better at home for 4 days after discharge, but had recurrent vomiting, back to ED, admitted again and discharged after a week-long stay.  She now comes to PSH after four episodes of emesis yesterday.

	Pt reports intermittent periumbilical pain, which worsens right before a bout of emesis, then dies down after the emesis.  Pain does not radiate; pt not able to characterize frequency, duration, or quality of the pain.  No obvious relationship between pain and PO intake.

	In between episodes of vomiting, she feels increased amount of secretions in her mouth that she has to spit out.  Denies any dysphagia or odynophagia.  No melena or hematochezia.  Had had constipation, which resolved with laxatives, more recently having 2 BMs/day.

	She does not recall the workup at OSH but thinks she may have had EGD and colonoscopy already, which she reports did not show any abnormality.



ROS:  no fever or night sweats.  No odynophagia or dysphagia.  No rash.  No CP, SOB, LE edema.  Appetite was good and no weight changes before 12/26/80; since then, she is afraid to eat and has lost weight and feels    weak

	There is a segment of terminal ileum demonstrates thickened wall.

	No significant surrounding inflammatory change.  There is

	questionable thickening of the gastric and proximal duodenal wall

	which may possibly be due to under distention.  There is no

	evidence of free air.

	There is no retroperitoneal, mesenteric or inguinal

	lymphadenopathy. 

A/P:     52yoF with DM with six weeks of recurrent green emesis and periumbilical pain without abdominal distention or KUB or CT signs of obstruction.  Question of TI thickening and gastric thickening (but may appear that way only due to underdistention).  As per pt, she has had EGD and colonoscopy at OSH already.  Would suggest obtaining records from Fairview-Southdale Hospital first before decision regarding repeat w/u here.  Workup may entail gastric emptying scan to assess for gastroparesis, EGD and colonoscopy to evaluate for malignancy or IBD, brain imaging to r/o CNS process.  Can continue to try Reglan 10mg up to QID.



Will staff with Dr. Otis Aguilera later today.

Attending Admission Note



HPI

52 year old woman with DM and h/o gastroparesis who presented with nausea and vomiting.  She was last admitted one week ago with N/V and treated for gastroparesis.  Her diabetes has been poorly controlled with her last hemoglobin A1c over 12 in April of 2081.  She has had recurrent episodes of nausea and vomiting.  During this past year in January, she was admitted to Missouri Baptist Hospital.  She had a negative EGD, and HIDA scan showed low ejection fraction to cholecystokinase.  She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  She was admitted again a few weeks later to Missouri Baptist and had a gastric emptying study, which was consistent with gastroparesis.  In February, she was seen in the Philadelphia State Hospital Emergency Room with nausea and vomiting and had a KUB, which showed significant stool.  She presented again on 02/11/2081 and had an abdominal CT that showed thickening of the terminal ileum and possible thickening of the gastric and possible duodenal wall.  GI was consulted and the colonoscopy done on 02/14/2081 was normal, but did not visualize the terminal ileum.  A small-bowel follow-through on 02/16/2081 was normal.  She was discharged on a regimen of Reglan and erythromycin.  Since February, she has been seen multiple times in the outpatient clinic as well as medical walk-in.  She reports being complaint with her regimen of erythromycin 250 mg four times a day and Reglan 10 mg twice a day.  She was also recently started on Glucophage titrating up to 1000 mg b.i.d. as she had difficulty with multiple short per day regimen of insulin administration.  



She was admitted from 5/31-6/2 and treated with IV Zofran and enemas.  GI saw the pt and recommended increasing reglan to TID and adding colace and miralax.  She also had a head CT to r/o mass lesion causing the nausea, and this was negative.  At the time of d/c, her nausea had decreased.  She states that the N/V did not improve much since that admission, and she has not been able to eat much.  She has pain throughout her abdomen.  She denies f/c, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematemesis, or melena.

NEURO:	            NL MS



Assessment and Plan	

1.  Nausea/vomiting:  Most likely secondary to her gastroparesis.  Her amylase and lipase are also elevated, raising the question of pancreatitis as well.  Will check abd-pelvic CT.  NPO with IVF.  Continue Reglan and erythromycin.  GI has been consulted for further recommendations.  Morphine prn abdominal pain.

2.  DM: Continue glucophage.  Adjust insulin depending on BS. 

3.  HTN:  Continue lisinopril and atenolol.

Reason for consultation:   Diabetes, gastroparesis

	

HPI:  52-yo woman with poorly-controlled DM diagnosed 2061 and h/o gastroparesis, retinopathy, nephropathy, peripheral neuropathy, and  with multiple visits and three recent admissions for n/v/gastroparesis: May 1-3and June 7-21, July 22. Her GI symptoms began in December, 2080. Delayed gastric emptying by nuclear medicine study, with 9% emptying at 60 minutes and 29% emptying at 90 minutes. 



Originally, she had been on oral medication and has been on insulin since 2076, initially on NPH bid and then switched to Lantus.  After her admission June 2081, she was placed back on NPH from what had been lantus 40 U qhs + metformin 1000 bid. HbA1C was 12.2, 4/2081, more recently it has been 10.2 in 7/2081 and 10.1 on 9/14/2081. 



On her last visit to see me in diabetes counseling approximately 10 days ago, gastroparesis was under good control without nausea or vomiting. Glycemic control, however, was poor, and it was clear to me that she was not properly administering a sliding scale, and this was too complex for her. Accordingly, and in response to severe hyperglycemia and a hemoglobin A1c above 10, we changed her reigimen to NPH 70/30 50Units BID. 

Her known diabetic complications include retinopathy with prior photocoagulopathy, nephropathy with microalbuminuria, neuropathy with intermittent numbness and tingling at night in feet, and no known macrovascular disease. Gastroparesis may be the consequence of poor glycemic control or frank autonomic neuropathy, but is often multifactorial. 

She was re-admitted to the PSH on 09/30/2081 after having 2 days of nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. She was unable tolerate any oral hydration in the ED, and was admitted for management. 

On ROSystems and history, she reports that she had been taking her new 70/30 insulin, 50 units BID. Sugars had been running 200s, all the time 200s, no better or worse. Nausea per her report began suddenly on Friday evening 09/27 and got gradually worse. Currently nausea has abated, but abdominal pain persists.

Written only for insulin sliding scale. Glucose 500+ on admission with anion gap of 20 that closed rapidly with hydration.

Impression   52F with poorly controlled type II DM and known neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy and gastroparesis, repeated admission for nausea, vomiting, poor nutrition. Found to be profoundly hyperglycemic on admission with BG of 526 with anion gap of 20. Rapidly closed anion gap to 10 with hydration alone.  Abdominal pain can be multifactorial. I don't doubt that this is most likely hyperglycemia with associated gut dysmotility, but differential includes small bowel angina (pain is definitely out of proportion to exam and seems colicky), hepatobiliary disease. With normal anion gap, I doubt that this is ischemic disease of the gut, but small bowel angina is still a possibility. 

Recommendations: 

1)	 Gastroparesis may be in part due to poor glycemic control, we need to achieve better glycemic control to help with gastric motility. 

a.	Would not hold long acting insulin. Start NPH 30U BID,    dose if NPO

b.	While NPO, have D5 running in IVF once fingerstick drops below 200, especially once NPH started. If she needs IVF at a higher rate, you might run D5NS at 50cc/hour along with NS or    NS at whatever rate is needed.

c.	Continue sliding scale insulin Q6H when NPO, QAC and QHS when eating, but change parameters to tighten coverage as follows:

i.	Fingerstick <150, 0 units; 151-200 4 units; 201-250 6 units; 251-300 8 units; 301-350 10 units, >350 12 units. 

d.	Start mealtime insulin (clearly hold while NPO) of 10U regular pre-breakfast and pre-dinner. Hold if NPO or PO intake poor. She will need rapid uptitration from this point once eating. 

e.	No metformin for now given GI upset. 

2)	Agree with other therapies for gastroparesis as she had been on as an outpatient, including ativan, reglan, zofran PRN, zelnorm, miralax, colace. 

3)	For crude r/o of poor circulation to gut you could send a lactate level and check stool guaiac. Colonoscopy and endoscopic exams were normal earlier this year, but this does not exclude small bowel angina. Study of choice would be MR angiography or CT angiography of abdominal vessels. I do not think this is warranted at this point, but ischemic small bowel should remain on the differential.  

4)	With hyperdynamic precordium and tachycardia, would check TSH, though this is almost certainly due to hypovolemia and compensatory response. 

Thank you for the consult.  

We will follow with you.  Please call with any questions.

Will staff in AM.

Attending Admission Note

HPI:  54 year old woman with h/o DM, HTN, and depression who is transferred to PSH from Missouri Baptist Hospital after being admitted from 2/15-2/20/83 and then readmitted on 2/22 with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  She has a h/o several admisions to the hospital for abdominal pain attributed to diabetic gastroparesis.  She has had an extensive GI work-up in the past including multiple abdominal CT scans, gastric emptying study, colonoscopy, upper endoscopy, and small bowel follow through.  All studies were negative except for the gastric emptying study.  She has been treated with multiple medications, including Reglan, Ativan, Compazine, and Zelnorm without much effect.  She is currently taking Neurontin and Cymbalta to treat neuropathic pain, and her PCP started her on MS Contin in December since nothing else seemed to be helping.  The pt states that the MS Contin helped during the month of December, but then it did not seem to be working as well.  The pt is distraught over her symptoms because the pain is severe and frequent.  She has been unable to return to work for 2 years because of the pain, and she would like to be able to do so.  The pain is not necessarily related to eating.  Yesterday, she felt well and was able to eat.  Today, she was doing fine until she had to drink the gastrografin, and then it escalated to an 8/10.  She received some IV morphine, and now it is down to 4/10.
	At Missouri Baptist Hospital, her MS Contin was held, but when her BP went up, she was restarted on it.  They also started clonidine BID for her uncontrolled HTN.  It appears that a AFP level was drawn and was elevated at 11.1.  However, it is written multiple times in the transfer materials that she had an elevated CEA level of 11.1.

HISTORY:  
     S/S ABD PAIN, NAUSEA/VOM, PLS ASSESS FOR OBSTRUCTION

REPORT:
     This study was reviewed by Dr. Yee and Dr. Janssen.
     HISTORY: As provided in the header.
     COMPARISON: 10/31/2081
     TECHNIQUE:
     Contiguous axial CT scans of both the abdomen and pelvis were
     performed from the lung bases to the proximal femora to assess for
     obstruction.
     Imaging was continued into the pelvis because a charge can affect
     both cavities.
     Abdominal and pelvic images were obtained following administration
     of both oral and intravenous contrast.
     FINDINGS:
     LUNG BASES. Linear densities in the lung bases likely represents
     atelectasis.
     HEPATOBILIARY.
     Liver. The liver is normal in appearance without evidence of
     biliary ductal dilatation or focal lesion.
     Gallbladder and Bile Ducts. Patient status post cholecystectomy.
     Pancreas. Normal in appearance.
     BOWEL. There is no evidence of the obstruction or bowel wall
     thickening.  A moderate amount of stool seen in the colon and
     rectum.
     GENITOURINARY:
     Kidneys. Normal in appearance without evidence of renal calculus
     or hydronephrosis.
     Ureters and bladder. Normal in appearance.
     Adrenal glands. Normal in appearance.
     Pelvic organs. Vascular calcifications are noted the pelvis.
     PERITONEUM:No evidence of fluid collection, free air or peritoneal
     mass lesions.
     RETROPERITONEUM:
     Lymph nodes. There are a few small bilateral inguinal lymph nodes

     GASTROPERISIS, NAUSEA AND VOMITING

REPORT:
     A gastric emptying study was performed using eggs labeled with 17
     MBq technetium 99m sulfur colloid.  There was no evidence of
     gastroesophageal reflux over 60 minutes of observation.  Gastric
     emptying was reduced, showing only 9% emptying at 60 minutes and
     29% emptying at 90 minutes.

Ordering Provider:  SHEEHAN, XIMENA

HISTORY:  
     iddm, htn, n/v and abdominal pain x 6 weeks, negative coloscopy, but
could not enter terminal ileum
assess for mass, TI thickening

REPORT:
     Image interpretation reviewed by Dr. Narvaez.
     TECHNIQUE:
     A single contrast small bowel series.
     FINDINGS:
     On small bowel follow through, the small bowel loops are normal in
     caliber and distribution. Spot compression views of the terminal
     ileum are normal. The transit time was normal.
     

IMPRESSION
     NORMAL SMALL BOWEL SERIES.
     
Assessment and Plan	
54 yo woman with DM, HTN, and depression who has had severe chronic abdominal pain x 2 years.  Extensive GI w/u has been negative except for gastric emptying study.
1.  GI: Pain is responsive to morphine.  Will continue MS contin and treat with IV morphine prn for breakthrough pain.  Gastroparesis has been a working diagnosis since all other testing has been negative.  She has other complications of DM which does put her at increased risk for autonomic dysfunction of the GI tract.  Other diagnoses to consider are bowel ischemia, although colonoscopy and CT scans in the past have not shown any changes in the bowel consistent with this diagnosis.  We will order CTA of the abdomen to rule this out.  She did have a negative anti-endomysial Ab in 2081, but I think it would be worth checking both anti-endomysial Ab and anti-gliadin Ab to r/u celiac sprue again.  We will send both an AFP and CEA levels to f/u on the unclear laboratory abnormality from Missouri Baptist Hospital.
2.  HTN:  BP is very elevated today, and this may in part be due to stopping the clonidine (which may have been given to help with GI motility).  Will continue her on her 40 mg dose of Lisinopril and 25 mg of HCTZ.  In addition, we will treat her with hydralazine until we can get the BP down.
3.  DM:  Will  treat with Insulin NPH 25 u Q am, 20 u Q pm and with sliding scale regular insulin.  Will monitor BS.
4.  Pain management:  Will continue Cymbalta and Neurontin along the the MS Contin and prn IV morphine.

DO,TANYA V   639-25-21-7                    VISIT DATE: 11/10/04

The resident's history, physical examination, and evaluation were 

reviewed by me; and I concur.  In addition, I personally 

interviewed and examined this patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 76-year-old female with 

a history of type 2 diabetes on Glucophage with a history of 

neuropathy who presents complaining of right foot pain, swelling, 

and redness.  The patient had a callus shaved off the plantar 

aspect of her foot approximately three weeks ago.  She noticed some 

aching pain in the area of her foot over the last several days and 

then in the last 24 to 48 hours has developed swelling and redness 

of her foot with inability to ambulate secondary to severe pain.  

She has had loss of appetite, but she denies any fever or 

generalized malaise.  She denies any leg swelling.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive for arthritis, type 2 diabetes, a 

history of vasculitis, history of diabetic neuropathy, and history 

of cataracts.  Her surgical history is positive for right total hip 

replacement, bilateral knee replacements, laminectomy in the back 

with fusion with rods, and a history of a colostomy with reversal.  

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  She has smoked in the past.  

She does not drink.  She is a retired Paralegal, lives alone.  She 

has a family history of diabetes.  Please see resident note for the 

remainder of the details of the patient's history including a long 

list of medications.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 99.0, pulse 94, 

respirations 18, blood pressure 137/50.  Oxygen saturation is 92% 

on room air.  The patient is an awake, alert, well-developed 

female, pleasant, talkative, in no acute distress.  EXTREMITIES: 

Her examination is most remarkable for the right lower extremity 

which shows edema and redness over the dorsum of her right foot.  

This extends down over the metatarsophalangeal joints and down 

underneath the plantar aspect of her foot over the heads of the 

metatarsals and the bases of the toes.  On the plantar aspect of 

the foot below the third toe, there is an area of skin change which 

is very tender.  There is a blanching yellow appearance that is 

very firm.  It is not fluctuant.  There is no drainage.  It appears 

to be the area where the callus was shaved.  The remainder of the 

foot is slightly firm, erythematous, and tender.  Her pulses are 

1+.  She has good capillary refill, and light touch is intact.  Her 

calf is soft and nontender.  Please see the resident note for the 

remainder of the details of the physical examination.  Evaluation 

of this patient in the Emergency Department included laboratory 

studies.  This is a diabetic patient with foot cellulitis secondary 

to a wound on the plantar aspect of her foot.  Of note, she also is 

exposed to pool water as she swims daily.  

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  She had laboratory studies performed which 

show a white blood cell count of 14,000; hematocrit 31.5; platelets 

348.  Her electrolytes including glucose are pending at the time of 

this dictation.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  IV access was obtained, and the 

patient was treated with IV antibiotics of Levaquin and 

Clindamycin.  

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Right foot cellulitis.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Her primary care 

physician, Dr. Keane, who saw her prior to her arrival in the 

Emergency Department was contacted.  The patient is being admitted

CHIEF COMPLAINT.  Follow-up with regard to multiple medical problems.

SUBJECTIVE.  She begins with a very long reprise of her complaints about her 
hospitalization at Sawtelle Veterans Hospital earlier this fall.

She then follows with a long discussion of the difficulties in securing 
diabetic supplies.  Her home blood glucoses have been variable, reportedly 
due to poorly functioning glucose meter.

The Neurology Consultant has added lisinopril and Plavix to her regimen.

Had what appears to have been an injection of epidural steroids for treatment 
of symptoms referable to spinal stenosis per Dr. Jaeger, to good effect.  Her 
back pain has now begun to recrudesce, and she is considering another such 
injection.

There are multiple other somatic complaints -- neck pain; recurring nocturnal 
sweating; dry cough; runny nose; other.

MEDICATIONS.  Baby aspirin; supplements of calcium and vitamin D; Fosamax 
70 mg once weekly; prednisone 5 mg b.i.d.; folic acid 1 mg per day; 
methotrexate 15 mg per week; Celebrex 200 mg b.i.d.; Glucophage 500 mg 2 PO 
b.i.d.; Zebeta 2.5 mg per day; lisinopril 20 mg per day; Plavix 75 mg per 
day; Lipitor 10 mg t.i.w.

PMH.  Reviewed.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS.  Other systems reviewed and are negative.

OBJECTIVE.  General appearance.  In no distress.  Vital signs.  Blood 
pressure 128/60 left arm sit.  Pulse 64 and regular.  Respiratory rate 12.  
Chest.  Clear.  Cardiovascular.  No murmurs.  Abdomen.  No mass, tenderness, 
or organomegaly.  Bowel sounds normal.

LABORATORY DATA.  Imaging studies reviewed; a PA and lateral chest x-ray, 
obtained on April 13, showed only bibasilar atelectasis.

Hemoglobin A1C was 6.5.

IMPRESSION.  

1.	Chronic rheumatoid arthritis:  apparently unchanged.
3.	DM:  ? current status.  Last time's hemoglobin A1C was slightly 
elevated.
6.	Psychosocial stresses.
29.	? TIA:  Now on lisinopril and Plavix per Neurology.

Ms. Do has had two prior hospitalizations for cellulitis/osteomyelitis. In 2104, she developed osteomyelitis following a fall, requiring surgery for debridment (right leg).  In 2106, she was also admitted to Seymour Hospital with cellulitis of right leg and required a 2-week course of IV antibiotics.  At this presentation, she has been in her usual state of health (ET 25 feet, limited by pain in legs, no dyspnea, no chest pain) until last Tuesday when she presented to her podiatrist for a corn removal (right foot). The podiatrist made an observation that she had some erythema on the dorsal part of the foot. She was not experiencing any pain.  Over this past week, she noted that the erythema and some swelling had extended, now to include the anterior portion of the lower shin.  She presented to EFHC for a follow-up appointment, and was treated with Keflex po.  Her cellulitis failed to improve and she presented to her PCP for evaluation on the day of admission, and was directly admitted to OGH.

Labs:
Recent labs pending
Radiology: 
CT Scan:  MILD SPLENOMEGALY WITH MULTIPLE DISCRETE SPLENIC LESIONS AND CALCIFIED FOCI.  DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS INCLUDES GRANULOMAS/SARCOIDOSIS.  ISOLATED LYMPHOMA IS ALSO A CONSIDERATION.  ON IMAGING IT IS DIFFICULT TO DIFFERENTIATE THESE PATHOLOGIES. 
	TWO DISCRETE LESIONS IN THE POSTERIOR CORTEX OF RIGHT KIDNEY ARE SUSPICIOUS FOR SOLID RENAL MASS OR HYPERDENSE CYST.
Assessment/Plan: 
	This is a 79 year old woman with past medical history of DM-2, chronic immunosuppresion (steroid use), RA, HTN, h/o leg ulcers, cellulitis and osteomyelitis, who presents with a 1 week history of left lower extremity swelling and erythema, without other symptomatic complaints, that has been resistant to po treatment
1.	Cellulitis - this woman is predisposed to cellulitis for a number of reasons, including chronic immunosuppression, diabetes, and prior surgeries to the area that have altered the anatomy and blood supply and lymphatic drainage.  Other potential causes include osteo or DVT. At this point, there is little to suspect osteo in this patient.
a.	Blood cultures
b.	Given her multiple problems, requires broad spectrum coverage - Zosyn 2.25 g IV q6 h (CrCl 45)
c.	Elevate the leg
d.	Warm compresses to increased circulation
e.	Mark the extent of cellulitis and monitor progression with therapy
f.	If cellulitis does not improve - will get imaging to evaluate for underlying infection. Will also get LENIS to rule out a DVT.
2.	Weight loss, anorexia, night sweats, now with R kidney mass - the differential for potential causes is very broad. She apparently had a negative PPD last year.  Extensive work-up to date was only notable for kidney cysts and mass
a.	Will attempt to schedule IR-guided biopsy
b.	Will stop ASA, plavix and celebrex in anticipation of the biopsy
c.	Continue to monitor fever curve
3.	Diabetes - patient is taking in normal diet, however in the setting of infection, will  put of home meds and do RISS/FSG
4.	HTN - continue Lisinopril
5.	RA - continue Prednisone and Methotrexate 
a.	Blood cultures (in the setting of patient's infection)
b.	Monitor fever curve and other vitals signs carefully
6.	Adrenal insufficiency - given patient's long term history of steroid use, she will need stress doses if becomes more acutely ill
7.	Prophylaxis - Nexium 20 qd; Fragmin 2500 U sc qd
8.	Code - DNI but wants chest compressions ""for a while"".  Healthcare proxy (Theresa  Kraft  270 Ridge Road/street, Little Elm, Mo 86277, tel 019-793-7578)

Patient Name: DO, TANYA V.;  MRN: 6051778
Dictated on: 09/08/2109 by TIBOR OQUINN, M.D. 

 
Ms. Tanya V. Do is an 81-year-old right-handed white woman with seropositive, nodular, erosive rheumatoid arthritis that was diagnosed in 2060, type II noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, vascular insufficiency in her legs, peripheral neuropathy, hearing loss in her left ear, right total hip arthroplasty surgery in 2070, right total knee arthroplasty surgery in 2081, left total knee arthroplasty surgery in 2082, a lumbar fusion performed in 2098 and again in 2099, a sigmoid colonic resection in 2103, cellulitis and osteomyelitis involving her right foot in October 2104, a cataract extracted from her right eye in 2102, a cataract extracted from her left eye in 2103, a transient ischemic attack in June 2106, and cellulitis involving her legs in 2107.  She returns to see me in rheumatologic follow-up at Rheumatology, this morning.  
 
Ms. Do has continued to take prednisone 5 mg by mouth twice daily, Celebrex 200 mg by mouth twice daily, and methotrexate 17.5 mg by mouth weekly, with good control of her joint pain, swelling, and stiffness.    
 
She continues to have difficulty grasping objects with her right hand, dropping objects that are held in that hand.  She also experiences numbness in her right ring and little fingers.  She wears a neutral resting splint on her right wrist for symptoms that she ascribes to right carpal tunnel syndrome.  She has opted not to undergo surgical treatment of her right ulnar neuropathy, after consultation with Dr. Kyron M. Castaneda of the hand surgery service at OGH.  
 
She has experienced inadequate treatment of her pain on Darvocet-N 100 two tablets taken by mouth once daily.   

She has continued to tolerate methotrexate therapy without symptoms of significant toxicity.  She has not experienced skin rashes, fevers, chills, sores in her nose or mouth, hair loss, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.   

She has continued to tolerate prednisone therapy without adverse symptoms other than for fragility of her skin and easy bruisability.  
 
She experienced improvement in her lower back discomfort following an epidural corticosteroid injection to her lower back on Jun 02, 2109.  She is scheduled to receive another epidural corticosteroid injection to her lower back on September 09, 2109.   

She has some difficulty dressing herself, getting in and out of bed, lifting a full cup or glass to her mouth, washing and drying her entire body, bending down to pick up clothing from the floor, and turning regular faucets on and off.  She has much difficulty walking outdoors on flat ground and getting in and out of an automobile.  She is unable to walk two miles or participate in sports or games to her liking. (MDHAQ = 1.8)  She has much difficulty getting a good night's sleep and she has some difficulty dealing with feelings of anxiety and depression.   

She is stiff throughout the day and experiences severe pain and severe fatigue.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital Signs  BP 148/60, P 64, RR 16, Temp 98.7 F, Wt 144 lb  Ms. Do was a very pleasant, cushingoid-appearing white woman in some distress due to pain.  Her skin was notable for ecchymoses on her extremities.  There was a healed skin graft on her left lower leg.  Well-healed scars were present over the lateral aspect of her right hip and over the anterior aspect of each knee.  There were no skin rashes.  Subcutaneous nodules, consistent with rheumatoid nodules, were present over the extensor surfaces of both elbows.  Her lungs were clear to auscultation.  Her cardiac examination revealed normal first and second heart sounds without murmurs or extra sounds.  Her musculoskeletal examination was notable for pain upon abduction and external rotation of her left shoulder.  There was ulnar deviation of the fingers of her right hand.  There was a boutonniere deformity of her left ring finger.  Bilateral hallux valgus deformities and cock-up toe deformities were present on both feet.  There was full painless motion of all small and large joints in both arms and legs without evidence of joint inflammation or of other significant joint deformity.  Her neurologic examination was notable for decreased sensation to light touch in the distribution of her right ulnar nerve, but was otherwise normal.  Her neurologic examination was normal with normal mental status, normal function of cranial nerves II through XII, normal muscle strength and tone in both arms and legs, intact sensation to light touch throughout, normal coordination, and symmetric deep tendon reflexes with downgoing plantar reflexes bilaterally. 
 
LABORATORY DATA:  I reviewed the laboratory data in the LMR with Ms. Do.  Studies performed at OGH on Jun 04, 2109, revealed ESR 19 mm/hr, CRP 10.6 mg/L, a benign urinalysis, ANA 1:80 with a speckled pattern of immunofluorescence, rheumatoid factor 165 IU/mL, and IgG anti-CCP antibodies 129 units.  

IMPRESSION:  
 
1.  Nodular, erosive rheumatoid arthritis since 2060, without evidence of synovitis on prednisone 5 mg p.o. b.i.d., Celebrex 200 mg p.o. b.i.d., and methotrexate 17.5 mg p.o. weekly.  She continues to be most limited by her right hand dysfunction and right ulnar neuropathy, but has opted to treat this conservatively.  
 
2.  Low back pain, treated with epidural corticosteroid injection on Jun 02, 2109.  
 
3.  Type II noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

4.  Vascular insufficiency in her legs.

5.  Peripheral neuropathy.

6.  Hearing loss in her left ear.

7.  Right total hip arthroplasty surgery in 2070.

8.  Right total knee arthroplasty surgery in 2081.

10. Left total knee arthroplasty surgery in 2082.

11. Lumbar fusion performed in 2098 and again in 2099.

12. Sigmoid colonic resection in 2103.

13. Cellulitis and osteomyelitis involving her right foot in October 2104.

14. Cataract extracted from her right eye in 2102.

15. Cataract extracted from her left eye in 2103.

16. Transient ischemic attack in June 2106.

17. Cellulitis involving her legs in 2107.  

RECOMMENDATIONS:  I discussed my impressions with Ms. Do.  I suggested that she increase her frequency of Darvocet-N 100 dosing to 2 tablets taken by mouth every 6 hours, as needed for pain control.  She will withhold a Tylenol dose, when she takes Darvocet N-100.  She will continue taking her other medications at their present doses.  
 
Laboratory studies will be performed today to assess her CBC, WBC differential count, plasma creatinine, ALT, AST, serum albumin, ESR, and CRP.  
 
Ms. Do will return to see me on December 11, 2109, at 9:40 a.m., so that I may assess her response to continued treatment and make any necessary changes in therapy.

A/P: 48M with a hx of DM2, PVD and multiple admissions in the past for LE cellulitis in the setting of gangrene. 

1.	ID: Patient is now presenting with appears to be another episode of cellulitis but now probably coming from his L 5th Toe lesion. Surgery has debrided the wound, sending wound cultures as well as blood cultures. Acute OM would not be visible on XR changes and clinical picture is more consistent with acute than Chronic OM. Will consider further work up for OM if symptoms do not respond to treatment. Levo and flagyl were added to unasyn in accord to previous culture data.

2.	PVD: Will need arterial LENIS to assess for vascular patency and flow. Continuing ACEI, and adding ASA and lipitor, will order lipid profile and smoking cessation consult.

3.	DM2: Very poor control last admission, eventhough patient now says he takes medications and checks it up to QID. Will order HgbA1C and glucose monitoring.

My dipstick: gluc 250, no ketones, 1.020, large blood, pH 5.0, 3+ protein, no nitrite, trace leukocytes

Urine spin: peach colored, granular casts, WBCS, rbcs (no dysmorphic), crystals, tubular epithelial cells



Imaging: 

CXR RLL PNA

C-spine - facet joint disease, granuloma in R lung apex

CT head - diffuse periventricular white matter attenuation and

	patchy areas of low density in the deep white matter of the

centrum semi ovale and coronal radiata. There are bilateral vertebral and carotid artery calcifications seen.

CT abd (I-/O-)- Relative iliopsoas fullness on the left believed on account of

	atrophy of the right sided musculature secondary to total hip

	arthroplasty on the right.

	Consolidation and/or atelectasis at the right base.

	Degenerative changes of the spine with spondylolisthesis of L4

	over L5



EKG: Aflutter with variable conduction at 100 -130 bpm



Impression:  79 M found down - fall could have been mechanical, vasovagal, vertebrobasilar disease, cardiac arrhythmia or valve disease, and remained on floor because of dementia +/- delerium, head injury from fall, stroke with weakness.  He was incontinent of urine and stool, though incontinence may have been an ongoing problem.  Aspiration likely, now with PNA.  Physical exam concerning for stroke with R leg weakness, RUE flexion and dysmetria.



Plan:  

1.	Syncope - Tele, TTE, MRI for stroke, MRA for VB dz

2.	New Afib - ECHO, TSH, EKG

a.	Did not respond to metoprolol or verapamil, will load digoxin, con't metoprolol po

3.	PNA - likely aspiration, treat with levo, flagyl, atrovent inhaler

4.	Renal failure - likely prerenal, though sediment exam c/w ATN.  Rhabdomyolysis possible, though CK's only 1000.

a.	Treat with fluids NaHCO3 200 cc / hr, see response in Cr

b.	U lytes, U myoglobin

c.	Renal US if not pre-renal

5.	DM - RISS, hold metformin

6.	Agitation -

a.	May improve with treatment of infection

b.	Seroquel QPM, haldol PRN

7.	Prophylaxis

a.	Heparin SC 5000 BID

b.	Nexium 20 QD

Gen=NAD.  
CV=RRR
Lungs=CTAB
Abd=soft, mildly distended, mildly tender in suprapubic area.
GU= large clots from foley catheter with grossly bloody urine

RELEVANT LAB/IMAGING STUDIES: 
CBC: 17.9>33.8<462 differential 92/4/4/0
Coags:  INR 4.9, PTT 44.1
UA: nitrite +, 3+ alb, packed RBC, 3-5 WBC, few bacteria, squamous cell neg

CXR ordered
EKG: pending

Renal US: Bilateral moderate pelvicaliectasis, new from prior CT from 2109.  Echogenic materials in bladder, presumably blood.  No mass or stones seen.

PROCEDURES:  Whistle tip foley placed and bladder was hand irrigated with 3L NS with large amount of clot removed.  Placed on Murphy drip with lightening of urine over 1 hour. 

ASSESSMENT/RECOMMENDATIONS:
81yo M with gross hematuria with clot, fever, and elevated WBC. Renal US obtained rather than CT scan b/c of elevated creatinine in diabetic patient.
-Admit to Urology service.  Patient needs to be on cardiac monitor.
-IV fluids: D5    NS at 100cc/hr.
-Please obtain CXR and EKG.
-NPO after midnight
-hold coumadin.  Patient receiving FFP to reverse anticoagulation.
-Will continue Levaquin (renal dosing)
-Please send blood cultures and urine culture.
-Will recheck chem. 7, CBC, coags in morning.
